EDITORIAL: A SAD JUDICIAL MUGGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed the judicial confirmation process in the
Senate had reached a nadir, Republicans this week set a new low. By
a strict party-line vote, they rejected a mainstream candidate for
a federal district judgeship in Missouri, Ronnie White, based on
trumped-up charges about his record in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   White, the first African-American to sit on Missouri's highest
court, had been waiting for more than two years for the Senate to
act on his nomination. He deserved better than the Republicans'
last- minute ambush, which President Clinton has blasted as a
``disgraceful act of partisan politics'' that ``maligned and
distorted'' White's record and provided strong evidence ``for those
who believe that the Senate treats minority and women judicial
nominees unequally.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who voted in lockstep to defeat White _ among them
Missouri's senior senator, Christopher Bond, who had warmly
introduced him to the Judiciary Committee _ this was not a vote of
principle. It was, transparently, a political favor for Missouri's
other senator, John Ashcroft, who is facing a tough re-election
battle and trying to gain an edge using the death penalty issue.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's debate, Ashcroft depicted White as a
``pro-criminal and activist'' judge who is reluctant to vote for
the death penalty. Put aside for the moment the fact that any
responsible judge familiar with cases of mistaken convictions
should feel hesitant about imposing the ultimate sanction of death.
What the record shows is that on the state bench, White has voted
to affirm the death sentence in dozens of cases. In those instances
where he voted for reversal, he has cited fundamental defects, like
ineffective assistance of counsel _ and much of the time he was
joined by judges appointed by Ashcroft himself when he was
Missouri's governor _ a detail that Ashcroft somehow forgot to
mention.
</P>
<P>
   By ganging up on White for failing to rubber-stamp the
prosecution in every case, Senate Republicans have undermined
judicial independence and made it harder to restore a sense of
bipartisanship to the Senate's lumbering judicial confirmation
process.  &QL;

ALBANY LAWMAKERS PASS DNA AND CLINIC BILLS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, New York _ The state Senate gave final legislative
approval to four major bills Thursday, including one that expands
the state's DNA database for tracking criminals and another that
increases penalties for blocking access to abortion clinics and for
stalking.
</P>
<P>
   The bills were passed by the Democratic-led Assembly in August
as its members rushed to adjourn a legislative session marked by
fierce partisanship. But by then, Republican leaders in the Senate
had broken off negotiations with Democrats and ordered their house
closed for the session. The Senate later agreed to return this
autumn to take up the measures.
</P>
<P>
   The other two bills adopted Thursday stiffen penalties for
making false bomb threats and allow the construction of power
plants in the state. All four measures now go to Gov. George
Pataki, who has said he will sign them into law.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA bill is considered the most far-reaching. It calls for
the collection of DNA ``fingerprints'' from people convicted of
many felonies. Just as fingerprints taken from criminals can be
matched to prints at crime scenes, a DNA database would allow law
enforcement officials to match blood, skin or hair samples found at
a crime scene against samples from convicted criminals in the
database.
</P>
<P>
   The state already collects DNA information, usually from a
saliva sample, from people convicted of certain violent crimes,
including sex crimes. The bill would expand the database, allowing
the state to gather samples from all violent felons and people
convicted of several other kinds of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Another major bill passed Thursday creates new criminal
penalties for blocking access to abortion clinics. The new law is
similar to federal legislation in that it makes it a crime to
harass or physically attack either abortion-clinic employees or
people seeking services from them. The state law, unlike the
federal version, can be enforced by local law officers, but it does
not allow victims of the prohibited activities to seek civil
damages in state courts against someone convicted of harassing or
attacking them.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic-access bill also includes a provision that does not
exist in the federal law, creating stiff penalties for the crime of
stalking. The measure was intended to provide victims, often women,
greater protection from harassment Another bill that the Senate
approved Thursday increases penalties for people convicted of
making false bomb threats to schools and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The other significant legislation passed Thursday allows for the
construction of power plants in the state for the first time in two
decades. Energy companies have begun applying to the state for
permission to build plants, mostly in the Hudson Valley. But
because of changes in federal law since then, no state agency
currently has the authority to issue permits.

FIRST ENCEPHALITIS DEATH IS REPORTED IN SUBURB OF NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ A 76-year-old Mineola woman has become the first
Long Island resident to die of the West Nile-like encephalitis
virus, Nassau County health officials announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was withheld because of patient
confidentiality, was one of two new cases of the virus reported on
Thursday by Nassau County officials, bringing the total to six.
There were also additional cases reported on Thursday in New York
City and Westchester County, and New Jersey officials reported the
first suspected case of the illness there.
</P>
<P>
   Officials could not say whether the Nassau woman, who died on
Oct. 4, contracted the virus here or in Queens, where most of the
cases have been reported. County Health Commissioner Kathleen A.
Gaffney said the new cases and the death of the Mineola resident
demonstrated the urgency with which the county needed to go forward
with its long-delayed plans to spray pesticide by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The aerial spraying was to have begun last Friday, but it was
delayed by rain, cold, too much wind and a lawsuit. The suit was
rejected by the courts, but the rain, wind and cold have persisted,
blocking spraying efforts not only in Nassau County, but in Suffolk
and Westchester Counties and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in New York City, where four people have died
of the virus, reported on Thursday that an additional case had been
confirmed, bringing the total for the city to 39, of which 27 were
in Queens, 9 in the Bronx, 2 in Manhattan and 1 in Brooklyn. That
latest case of the virus in the city was a 56-year-old woman from
Queens, who was said to had been released from a hospital in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
   An additional case, a woman in her 40s, was also reported on
Thursday in Westchester, where one person has died of the virus,
bringing the total number of cases in the county to nine, officials
said. As in other areas, officials said they hoped to resume
spraying on Friday and to continue through the weekend, weather
permitting.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, health officials said they were awaiting the
results of tests by the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention
to determine whether a resident of Lakewood had contracted the West
Nile-like encephalitis virus. The man is a patient at the Jersey
Shore Medical Center in Neptune, where a spokeswoman, Christine
Scott, said his condition was critical.
</P>
<P>
   If the cold, windy weather continues to inhibit spaying, there
is concern that enough mosquitoes now infected with the virus might
survive through the winter to enable the cycle to start again in
the spring. The mosquitoes could also continue to bite and feed on
birds, animals and people until most of the insects are killed by a
frost. Some, however, could survive the winter among warm damp
leaves in the underbrush, especially if it is a mild winter, health
officials have said.

AMERICAN AIR MUST COMPENSATE 13 FOR TURBULENCE-RELATED STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When an American Airlines cross-country flight hit
severe turbulence in 1995, terrified passengers were hurled from
their seats, and some were sure they were about to die. Those 28
seconds of terror, a federal jury said Thursday, were worth $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   The award will be divided among 13 passengers who filed suit
against the airline for the emotional distress they suffered aboard
the Los Angeles to New York flight.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, ruled that the
airline was responsible for the psychological impact because its
ground personnel and the flight crew did not take proper steps,
like activating weather-sensing radar, to detect and possibly avoid
the severe Midwest storm that created the turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers for the passengers, James Kreindler, said the
damages were the highest ever awarded by a jury for purely
emotional rather than physical injuries in a lawsuit over airline
turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Most such suits are settled out of court for modest sums,
Kreindler said, but the suit over the trauma aboard Flight 58 was
pursued, he said, because the airline's settlement offers ``were
insulting, from $5,000 to $20,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's verdict included awards for each passenger's
emotional injuries that ranged from $150,000 or more for each of
the adults to as much as $200,000 for the children who were among
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The jury ordered American also to pay a total of $145,000 to
some of the passengers for relatively minor physical injuries they
suffered. But it was the accounts of psychological trauma that
clearly riveted the jury as passengers, including parents traveling
with children, described their terror and despair, and how it felt
to prepare for death.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard my daughter scream and I couldn't find her,'' a
passenger, Karen Berman, told the jury. She was with her daughter,
Leah, who was 7 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I turned my head,'' Ms. Berman testified, ``and she was in
the air, like she was ejected out of her seat, and it seemed like
she was just floating in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berman said that she grabbed her daughter by the foot.
``Leah kept saying, `Mommy, what's happening?''' Ms. Berman said.
She said she tried to reassure her daughter, but was lying to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought that this is how we were going to end our
lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Evidence in the trial showed that Flight 58, which left Los
Angeles on June 25, 1995, bound for Kennedy International Airport,
was flying at about 37,000 feet about 25 miles west of Minneapolis
when it encountered a severe thunderstorm. The seatbelt sign was
off.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who were not wearing seatbelts were thrust from their
seats, and the plane was forced to make an emergency landing in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contended that American had ample warning of the storm
but failed to turn on the seatbelt sign.
</P>
<P>
   American conceded that it had hit the turbulence, which meant
the jury had to decide only the damages for what Kreindler called
the passengers' ``28-second nightmare, facing your own death.''
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines spokesman Mark Slitt said, ``We're
disappointed at the size of the award,'' and added that the airline
was considering its options, such as whether to seek a reduction in
the verdict or appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In court, the airline's lawyers had suggested that passengers
were exaggerating about their emotional injuries. ``The point is
that all of the people here continue to do what they did before,''
airline lawyer George Tompkins told the jury Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a memory of this incident _ of course they do,'' he
said. ``Everybody who has ever been involved in an accident is
going to have a memory of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the difference under the law, he added, was, ``How has it
affected their life?''
</P>
<P>
   Kreindler and his co-counsel, Daniel Rose, did not deny that the
passengers had continued with their lives, with some even flying
again, but they said each had been emotionally scarred,
particularly the three children among the plaintiffs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another passenger, Nancy Spielberg, who was flying with her two
daughters, Jessica, 6, and Melissa, 2, agreed. ``Letting my
children heal is the most important thing for me,'' Ms. Spielberg
said Thursday. ``Money is not what drives me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spielberg, the sister of the film maker Steven Spielberg,
had told the jury of the horror of ``bodies flying everywhere'' as
the plane pitched and dove, including Jessica, whom she grabbed by
the ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let go of my baby,'' Ms. Spielberg said. She
said she desperately guided her child back into her row as the
plane lurched again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking at that moment that there is no God,'' Ms.
Spielberg told the jury, ``and there is nobody that's going to save
us. And to me, that was probably one of the saddest moments in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the airline disputed the contention that the
turbulence had lasted nearly half a minute, arguing that it could
have been much shorter. A report of the airline said that the
severe turbulence lasted five to eight seconds and that the pilot
had reported rapid vertical movements.
</P>
<P>
   But the passengers made it sound as if they felt it would never
end. Garry Bonner of Hackensack, N.J., a singer who was a co-writer
of ``Happy Together'' for the Turtles, testified that the plane
rose and fell repeatedly, and then made a dive, as if it had lost
power and was falling out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody started gasping for breath,'' he said. ``I could
hear everybody gasping.''

BORDER PATROL PLANS CRACKDOWN NEAR DOUGLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
The Immigration and Naturalization Service plans to launch a major
crackdown on illegal immigration in southeast Arizona during the
next few months, while at the same time easing travel restrictions
in the bor der zone.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The double-barreled program is to be announced Oct. 8 in Tucson,
where INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and Mexican Ambassador Jesus
Reyes Heroles will reveal broad proposals to improve safety and
commerce along the Arizona-Sonora frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol will soon hit Douglas and Naco with Operation
Safeguard, an enforcement blanket that already covers most of the
U.S.-Mexico line, said Virginia Kice, an INS regional spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Border Patrol will use spotlights, fences,
sophisticated technology and extra agents to com bat the flood of
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mexican and U.S. au thorities plan to expand a
25-mile zone on both sides of the border. On the Arizona side, open
territory would extend 65 miles north to encompass Tucson. That
means for eign tourists, shoppers and business people visiting the
United States will not have to hassle with the paper work now
required.
</P>
<P>
   Kice said the idea is to create ``a border that works'' with
policies that promote commerce while preventing illegal
immigration. ``The border shouldn't divide us,'' she added. ``It
should bring us together.''
</P>
<P>
   The beefed-up enforcement _ simi lar to programs deployed in
Nogales _ drew mixed reviews from Douglas residents who have
complained for months that it is funneling illegal immigrants and
smugglers to Co chise County.
</P>
<P>
   During fiscal 1999, which ended last month, Border Patrol agents
from Nogales to New Mexico appre hended 470,449 undocumented immi
grants _ more than double the number picked up in 1995. &QL; 
Will it stem tide?
</P>
<P>
   ``They can line 'em up side-by-side from the Pacific to Del Rio,
Texas, and it's not going to stop the problem,'' said Douglas Mayor
Ray Borane, who was scheduled to meet with Meissner on Oct. 9.
``The problem is Mexico _ their economy and their poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of filling his town with uniformed agents, Borane said
the Clinton administration should pres sure Mexican authorities to
stop the immigrant-smuggling cartels and the corruption that thrive
in northern Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making our town a militarized zone,'' Borane said of
Operation Safeguard.
</P>
<P>
   Thelma Vance, who lives about a mile from the border and
routinely watches groups of immigrants sneak past her home,
welcomes the federal crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything's worth a try,'' Vance said. ``They have to control
the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas residents met this year with congressional leaders and
held com munity meetings to bemoan the glut of immigrants, as well
as the trash and crime that comes with them. At the same time, many
worried about the danger faced by desperate illegal immigrants who
trek through deserts and mountains to avoid Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began a gradual escalation of U.S.-Mexico
border enforcement about five years ago when Mexico's economy bot
tomed out, leading to a dramatic rise in illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Agents swarmed to El Paso and San Diego first, building fences
and using helicopters to stem the tide of immigrants. Those efforts
moved many of the migrants, and smug glers, to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Border Patrol launched Operation Safeguard in
Nogales, trying to blockade illegal immigra tion there. The result:
a dramatic rise in apprehensions, followed by an other shift of
economic refugees and ``coyotes'' _ smugglers of illegal immigrants
_ into the Naco-Doug las area.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with limited forces, the Border Patrol made 202,868
appre hensions in Douglas _ four times the number in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Gavin, an INS spokeswoman, said Cochise County is one of
the last gaps in the enforcement wall. ``We're closing down on
it,'' she added. &QL; 
Boosting border business
</P>
<P>
   Kice said the expanded visitor zone _ which begins Dec. 1 _ will
allow Mexicans with border crossing cards to visit Tucson for up to
72 hours without filing registration forms. It will be employed as
a one-year experiment, and affects only entrants via U.S. ports at
Nogales, Douglas, Naco and Sasabe.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Echols, a research assistant with the Tucson City Manager's
Office, said officials expect a mini-boon in tourism _ estimated at
more than $53 million a year. She noted that more than 500,000 Mexi
cans from Sonora and Sinaloa have border crossing cards.
</P>
<P>
   The new visitor zone is not expected to affect Border Patrol
enforcement, Kice said, and will not require checkpoints to be
closed or moved.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. citizens would also be allowed to travel farther
south into Mexico without going through customs or filling out
visitor registra tion forms.
</P>
<P>
   When Meissner and Reyes Heroles announce the new policies this
after noon, they are to be accompanied by Gus de la Vina, chief of
the Border Patrol; Johnny Williams, western regional director of
the INS; and David Aguilar, Tucson's Border Pa trol chief.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 9, Meissner is expected to visit the border in Douglas
and Naco, touring facilities and meeting with residents. &QL;

PETTITTE KEEPS YANKEES IN CONTROL OF RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees may not own the Texas Rangers,
but they seem to have a seasonal rental agreement. Every October,
the Yankees use the Rangers for playoff fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte and two relievers became the latest pitchers to
shackle the Rangers, as the Yankees defeated Texas, 3-1, at Yankee
Stadium Thursday night in Game 2 of the American League division
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have scored two runs in their last 51 playoff
innings against the Yankees, now return home for Game 3 and _ they
hope _ Game 4 on Saturday and Sunday, and on those days the Yankees
are scheduled to start pitchers with 427 career victories combined,
Roger Clemens and David Cone, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers led, 1-0, in the fifth, had runners at second and
third and nobody out. But Pettitte turned the game around there,
retiring the next three hitters and holding the runners in place,
and then in the bottom half of the fifth inning, Scott Brosius
doubled home Tino Martinez with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez walked with one out in the seventh. And with Texas' Lee
Stevens holding Martinez at first, Chili Davis skipped a ground
ball through the first-base hole, Martinez moving to third. It was
at this point that the Rangers' lack of left-handed relievers hurt
them.
</P>
<P>
   With the left-handed-hitting Ricky Ledee coming to bat and Texas
manager Johnny Oates intent on saving his one good left-hander,
Mike Venafro, for the likes of Paul O'Neill, weary starter Rick
Helling stayed in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee capitalized, dumping a double between the outfielders in
center and right, Martinez scoring the go-ahead run. Tim Crabtree
relieved Helling at that point and shut down the Yankees' rally
without more runs scoring, but the Yankees had what they needed in
their eighth consecutive playoff victory against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored their last run in the eighth, when Venafro
walked Jim Leyritz with the bases loaded to force home a run.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed just the one run in 7 1-3 innings, striking out
five.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts and shorts have given way to jackets and sweaters at
Yankee Stadium. The temperature dipped to 47 degrees by game time
and players on both teams were warming their bare hands between
pitches, Pettitte blowing on his clenched fist as he looked in for
the sign, Chuck Knoblauch stuffing his right hand into the back
right pocket of his pants.
</P>
<P>
   But Helling, of Fargo, N.D., took the mound in short sleeves;
the temperature was well above freezing, after all, and Helling
looked entirely comfortable, his approach simple. He threw
fastballs. Lots and lots of fastballs. High fastballs and low
fastballs, and every once in a while, he would bounce in a
curveball, just to be different.
</P>
<P>
   In midsummer _ when fans were wearing T-shirts and shorts _ he
might have got in trouble, but with the cold exacerbated by a
swirling wind, fly balls were not carrying well. Brosius smashed a
high fastball to straightaway center and the air seemed to freeze
the ball, which Roberto Kelly caught 50 feet or so short of the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, the next batter, tomahawked a fastball toward the
wall in left. It appeared as if Girardi had hit just his third home
run of the season. But the ball settled in the mitt of left fielder
Rusty Greer well in front of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good night for pitchers to challenge hitters, and this
is what Helling did, and he retired the first 10 batters he faced,
throwing fastballs with 41 of his first 44 pitches, striking out
five. Derek Jeter was the first Yankees base runner, in the fourth,
when he doubled with one out.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were a little tougher on Pettitte. Rafael Palmeiro
and Todd Zeile hit singles to open the second inning before
Pettitte struck out Kelly with high fastballs and Stevens hit into
a double play. But in the fourth inning, Juan Gonzalez reached far
across the plate for a fastball _ low and outside, a great pitch _
and pulled a line drive into the left-field stands. With that, the
Rangers took a 1-0 lead and ended their streak of 25 consecutive
scoreless playoff innings against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly singled to center leading off the fifth and Stevens
bounced a double into the stands, a break for the Yankees. Kelly
would probably have scored if the ball had skipped low off the
wall, but the ground-rule double forced Kelly to stop at third.
Texas had second and third and nobody out. Ramiro Mendoza, a
right-hander, warmed up hurriedly in the Yankees' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching deliberately, Pettitte fell behind Mark McLemore, three
balls and one strike, and he might have been one pitch away from
being yanked. The switch-hitting McLemore, after all, had batted
.163 as a right-handed batter, and walking him would have been a
crime. But Pettitte threw a strike, then flipped a breaking ball
off the outside corner _ and McLemore, in a classic example of the
Rangers' reckless aggressiveness, swung and missed. One out.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte fell behind to Royce Clayton, two balls and no strikes,
the crowd murmuring tensely. Helling was pitching wonderfully, and
preventing the Rangers from scoring any more runs seemed
imperative.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte fired a strike, came back with another low fastball,
and Clayton topped a grounder to Brosius. The runners had to hold
as Brosius threw to first. Two out.
</P>
<P>
   Now Pettitte had to deal with Greer, who fouled off two pitches,
running the count full. Pettitte breathed warmth into his left
hand, looked for the sign: breaking ball. He spun the curveball
into the dirt, Greer flailed wildly and missed. Pettitte whirled on
the mound and pumped a fist, overcome by emotion. He and the
Yankees had escaped.

AMWEST KNEW OF FAULTY WARNING SYSTEM IN ACCIDENT, BUT DID NOT
CORRECT IT, U.S.
 SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - An accident that in jured four flight attendants last
month is being blamed on a faulty warning system that America West
knew about but had not corrected, according to federal
investigators.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing its probe
of the Sept. 20 in-flight accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at why the problem persisted,'' said Bob
Crispin, a safety board investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots who flew the Boeing 757 aircraft before the accident
reported problems with the ground-proximity warning system.
Mechanics tested the device but did not find out what was wrong,
said Steve Johnson, America West chief administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what exact problems the pilots reported with the
computer warning system, but there had been no previous injuries on
America West as a result of a false warning, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured flight attendants, Celinda Levno, said she
hopes that the investigation improves safety at America West for
passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pain and suffering is worth it if it makes the airline
safer,'' said Levno, who broke her left leg and foot in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The board is examining what main tenance America West performed
to repair the warning system and whether the problems were beyond
the scope of what the airline could have been expected to solve,
said Crispin, who is heading the investi gation.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say how long America West had been having trouble
with the warning system, but the board is checking maintenance
records of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a stack of paperwork 4 or 5 feet tall to go through,''
Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is researching whether there have been similar
problems on the warning systems for the worldwide fleet of Boeing
757s, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   Two flight attendants were seriously injured and two suffered
minor injuries in the sudden evasive maneu ver, according to the
board's prelimi nary accident report.
</P>
<P>
   An aircraft operation that results in a death, serious injury or
substantial damage to the plane is considered an accident by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was not damaged and none of the 170 passengers was
injured on Flight 2208, which was en route from Los Angeles to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots Franklin Etter and John Spriggs reacted as they were
trained to do under the circumstances, Cris pin said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft was descending through clouds at a rate of about
4,000 feet per minute when the warning system sounded. Etter and
Spriggs pulled up on the aircraft at an altitude of 22,000 feet and
increased the engine power to maximum thrust. The plane's nose
pitched upward about 8 degrees, and the aircraft began to climb at
a rate of 3,400 feet per minute, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants in the back galley fell about 8 feet when
the cabin floor dropped out from under them, Crispin said, adding
that it's fortunate that the injuries were not more serious.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said one of the flight
attendants fractured her leg, another broke her ankle, a third
suffered a badly sprained knee and the fourth was badly bruised and
had neck and back injuries.
</P>
<P>
   None of the injured flight attendants has returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't return to work until they're healthy and ready to
fly again, and we don't know when that is,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ground-proximity warning sys tem, which alerts pilots if
they are flying too close to mountains or other terrain, is linked
with a plane's collision-avoidance system, which warns of nearby
aircraft, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   That system had alerted the America West pilots of a plane
passing 1,000 feet below them just before the ground-proximity
warning system sounded.
</P>
<P>
   America West has replaced the warn ing systems since the
accident and the plane was returned to service after an extensive
check by company mechanics, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 13-year-old aircraft was grounded for scheduled
maintenance to examine the entire aircraft and its avionics, the
electronic and computer systems that control the plane, John son
said.
</P>
<P>
   That work is being done at a contract maintenance facility in In
dianapolis operated by United Air lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers of the warnings systems, AlliedSignal and
Rockwell Collins, are testing the devices that were removed after
the accident, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been found wrong with the systems, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The board expects to issue a final accident report within six
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration in its initial accident
report cites improper maintenance as a factor but did not include
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 involved in the accident had a previous
mechanical failure, when the hydraulic system failed on July 4,
1997. The plane, which is painted with the Diamond backs logo, made
a safe emergency landing in Phoenix after circling for more than an
hour to burn fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West, the na tion's ninth-largest airline,
has never had a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   However, the carrier was fined $5 million in July 1998 by the
FAA for maintenance violations, one of the largest fines ever in
commercial-aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   America West paid half that fine immediately. FAA administrators
in Washington agreed to waive the remaining $2.5 million on July 14
after deciding that the Tempe-based carrier had complied with the
re quired corrective actions.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision went against the recommendation of Phoenix FAA
inspectors, who did not believe America West had complied.
</P>
<P>
   Local inspectors wanted to extend the compliance deadline and
use the remaining $2.5 million fine as lever age, but were
overruled.

DE VILLIERS GRAAFF, 85, EX-LEADER OF SOUTH AFRICAN CENTRIST
OPPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir de Villiers Graaff, who led South Africa's weak and troubled
parliamentary opposition for two decades during the apartheid era,
died Oct. 4 at his farm outside Cape Town. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Graaff, who was nicknamed ``Sir Div'' and ``Div,'' had an
``impeccable Afrikaner background,'' as The Daily Telegraph put it
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A burly six-footer, he succeeded to his baronetcy in 1931 after
the death of his father, Sir David Graaff, a well-to-do businessman
who had been made a baronet by King George V for his services in
helping to form the Union of South Africa, which was created in
1911. The family surname is pronounced ``grahf.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir de Villiers studied at Cape Town University and Oxford,
became a lawyer in South Africa and was decorated for his military
service in World War II. He was a member of South Africa's
Parliament from 1948 to 1977, representing a constituency in Cape
Town for most of that time.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1977 he was the leader of the centrist United
Party, the official opposition in the all-white Parliament, which
was dominated by the National Party of John Vorster, who was prime
minister from 1966 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But as The Cape Times put it, ``The bare facts'' of Graaff's
``career as leader of the opposition offer little encouragement to
the most admiring biographer.''
</P>
<P>
   In that role, he condemned the National Party's program of
forcing blacks by the millions into enclaves called homelands.
Still, as The Times of London reported, ``He upheld racial
segregation and white supremacy.'' And after the Sharpeville
massacre of 1960, he came out in favor of the government's steps to
ban the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped down as the United Party's leader in June 1977, and
the party was dissolved after years of decline. By then the number
of seats it held in the Parliament had dwindled to only 24, from 41
in 1974, after defections to the left and the right. By June 1977
the party had split four times and had been defeated in five
general elections.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure as leader, he got mixed reviews in South
Africa. David Welsh, senior lecturer in African government and law
at the University of Cape Town, wrote in a 1975 book that Graaff
had ``shown strength and resilience in riding out storms within the
party, but he has come under fire from left and right for
equivocation and ambivalence.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, nearly five years after South Africa's exit from the
British Commonwealth, National Party members had great fun asking
why Graaff had not renounced his baronetcy. The Times of London on
Thursday reported that the baronetcy would pass to Graaff's elder
son, David, unless that son disclaimed it.
</P>
<P>
   Graaff is also survived by his wife of 60 years, the former
Helena Voigt; another son, and a daughter.

SPORTS COLUMN: WIN OR LOSE, ONCE AGAIN, YANKS RULE PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is easy to tell a Mets fan this week _ the one
looking like a tropical fish, with expressionless eyes and a gaping
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Quite sadistically, baseball is turning them into guppies, what
with its staggered and staggering late games.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you say, that's what Mets fans look like normally. That's
cold. You must be a Yankee fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, those darlings of the ratings, are two-time
champions and deserve their place in the choice television hour of
8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, they beat Texas, 3-1, to open up a two-game
advantage in this short series. Young fans were surely sent to bed
before the end, but at least adult fans had a crack at watching
Jeff Nelson and Mariano Rivera save the victory for the gallant
Andy Pettitte in the late innings, the right of every baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   For cruel and unusual punishment, however, baseball really must
have it in for Mets' fans, putting games on after 11 p.m. on
Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great watching baseball, especially when you know every
game is so important,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, who
said he stayed up to watch the Mets' 7-1 loss Wednesday night _
``right to the bitter end,'' rooting for Todd Stottlemyre, the
winning pitcher and son of Torre's pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every player talks about it, and I know my staff
watches,'' Torre said of the television exposure. ``It's fun
watching it because you know everybody's going to watch us
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are entertainers, and love to know they are being
watched by their peers as well as their fans. But Mets fans were
treated callously in their first post-season games since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were back home on Thursday on an alleged off day,
trying to catch up on their sleep after an overnight run to
Cincinnati, followed by two games in Arizona, followed by a
daylight landing in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes make these cross-country flights all the time, and
their charter flights are not as crowded as the coach torture
chambers the average flier must endure.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are not going to have a lot of sympathy for million-dollar
entertainers, but fans should not be surprised to see athletes
stumble around after playing so late in the West and then rushing
back East.
</P>
<P>
   The networks rationalize the late, late games by saying that the
Yankees deserve star billing, but Bud Selig and his cohorts long
ago sold out any pretension of integrity in regard to the networks.
</P>
<P>
   The fans support the team all year, buying expensive tickets,
splurging on all the trendy junk baseball markets, and just plain
caring about these guys, and then baseball turns around and says,
``The heck with you people, we're putting other games on in the
late afternoon and evening. If you want to watch the Mets, take a
nap and stay up late.''
</P>
<P>
   How contemptuous. Baseball is trying to serve two masters here _
the networks, and the calendar. By squeezing in three rounds of
playoffs, baseball is already defying the laws of nature that
dictate it is going to get colder and colder as this month drags
on.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing about going to a third round is that baseball
officials have this morbid fear of playing a World Series game in
November. This year, the seventh game of the World Series would be
held on Oct. 31 _ Halloween. Those won't be fright masks you will
see. Those will be the faces of hitters jammed on the fists with
fastballs in 30-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there was the totally ridiculous situation of the
Yankees having a day off on Wednesday in crisp early October
weather. This was to avoid saturating the airwaves, what with games
in Atlanta after 4 p.m., Cleveland after 8 p.m. and Arizona after
11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have moved up each game by an hour or two? So
what if Arizona fans had to get to the ball park by 5 or 6 p.m.?
What else do they have to do in Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   But Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondbacks' owner, wanted two games
in prime time in the Pacific time zone _ so where's the ocean? _
and Jerry Colangelo got them. Nice to know who's got clout in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the late starts worse is the plodding pace of the
games. Including Thursday night, the first eight games of the
playoffs ran an average of eight minutes longer than baseball's own
record-setting trudge of 2 hours 53 minutes for the past season.
</P>
<P>
   The starting times should have been adjusted. All it would have
taken was respect for the loyal Mets' fans. &QL;

PRESIDENT SETS BRISK PACE IN NEW YORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton came to New York Thursday to pay
tribute to two political constituencies that had proved central to
his electoral success _ labor unions and gay rights advocates _ and
now loom as critical to the political future of Clinton's wife and
his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of two hours, and in the space of two city blocks,
Clinton spoke at a dinner in honor of James P. Hoffa, the president
of the teamsters' union, and moved on to a fund-raiser for New
York's most prominent gay rights group, the Empire State Pride
Agenda. In both places, Clinton drew an exuberant reaction from
audiences that have, as often as not, been viewed as a political
liability by candidates and officeholders over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for making New York the biggest, strongest union
city in America,'' Clinton declared to the cheers of labor leaders.
And when Clinton mentioned the guest of honor's name, he was
overwhelmed by shouts of ``Hoffa, Hoffa, Hoffa!''
</P>
<P>
   Labor and gay rights organizations have proved to be reliable
parts of Clinton's political base. But given the extent to which
those groups have been the subject of Republican attack over the
past 10 years, Clinton's appearances suggest the freedom he feels
as he approaches the end of his second term, and his evident
interest in helping Vice President Al Gore, who is running for
president, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is all but running for
the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton left the dinner, Hoffa told the audience, ``I got
a good idea speaking to the president: Why don't we all get
together and back Hillary Clinton as senator for the state of New
York?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the Hilton Hotel at the tribute to Hoffa
was the first time that a president had appeared so publicly with
the much investigated teamsters' union since Franklin D. Roosevelt
spoke at one of its conventions more than 50 years ago. Clinton
drew cheers from the audience as he shook hands with Hoffa, who has
been a leading opponent of an immediate endorsement of Gore in the
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that I wanted to do when the vice president
and I came into office was to change the way that America thought
about labor,'' Clinton said. ``I was so sick and tired of more than
a decade of people trying to make unions the whipping boy of
whatever it was that was wrong with America.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue of particular concern to his labor audience was the
North American Free Trade Agreement and its call to allow Mexican
trucks to drive freely in the United States. Clinton indicated that
he shared their concern because American officials have found that
two-thirds of Mexican trucks are not safe.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Clinton moved a block west to the annual dinner of
the Empire State Pride Agenda at the Sheraton. Clinton is one of
several candidates who have, over the years, turned to gay rights
organizations for campaign contributions. But in this case, the
president was the draw rather than beneficiary of a dinner that
organizers said would raise $1 million for lobbying and political
candidates sympathetic to gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was escorted to the stage by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. to
a three-minute standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am indebted to you because I happened to be president and
seek this job at a time when you are raising these issues, and you
gave me a chance to make a contribution,'' Clinton said. ``You made
me a better president and you made me a better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech to the Empire State Pride Agenda was his third
appearance as president in a public setting before a gay rights
group. His attendance was testimony to the growing influence of gay
voters in New York elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our second annual dinner, we were wondering if David
Dinkins would show up,'' said Jeff Sorof, the co-chairman of the
organization, referring to New York's former mayor. ``This is quite
a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also did what he typically does on his frequent visits
to New York: raise money for the Democratic Party. In this case, he
was the featured speaker at a $500,000 fund-raiser Thursday for the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared in New York alone. Mrs. Clinton was in
Italy. Gore was in New York, but he and Clinton did not cross
paths.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended the dinner for Hoffa just four days before the
AFL-CIO, which includes the teamsters, holds a convention in Los
Angeles, where several union leaders are urging an endorsement of
Gore over Bill Bradley, the former senator from New Jersey. It is
far from certain that Gore's supporters can command the two-thirds
majority needed to endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has urged other labor leaders to hold off on an
endorsement to see whether the administration will give assurances
on trade barriers and other matters. Among Hoffa's concerns is
persuading the government to end its decade-long supervision of the
union, which has been imposed to end corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was sponsored by the Labor Research Association, a
consulting group that advises unions. For decades, presidents have
shied away from the union because of its history of corruption. But
federal officials said that the 1.4 million-member union is
significantly cleaner after a decade of supervision.

BASEBALL COLUMN: LEDEE TAKES TORRE'S WORDS TO HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS.: this story, eliminated earlier, is now restored)  
 (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ricky Ledee was a few feet from Joe Torre when the
manager gathered the Yankees together in the clubhouse before the
division series against the Texas Rangers started Tuesday. Torre
reminded his players to appreciate where they were. Torre rarely
raises his voice, but his soothing words are powerful words. Ledee
listened closely.
</P>
<P>
   Torre pointed to Derek Jeter and mentioned how the 25-year-old
shortstop had been on five straight post-season teams and reminded
everyone that Jeter's wonderful journey had been abnormal. Just
study my career, Torre said. It took Torre 32 years as a player and
a manager to be involved in his first World Series game, so he
knows how to describe exasperation in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Joe said really made me think,'' Ledee said. ``I wasn't
even supposed to be on the team last year and look what happened.
You have to enjoy this, but you can't expect it's going to happen
every year. That's what Joe was trying to tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee heard Torre's words and appreciated Thursday night even
more after he looped a double into right-center field off Rick
Helling in the seventh inning to break a 1-1 tie and help the
Yankees defeat the Rangers, 3-1, and take a 2-0 lead in the
three-of-five-game series. Ledee's hit symbolized the differences
between the Yankees, who expect to beat Texas, and the Rangers, who
expect to succumb to New York and did for the eighth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know why the Yankees smacked the Rangers again
Thursday night and basically turned their weekend in Arlington,
Texas, into a formality, find a videotape of the game and watch the
fifth and eighth innings. Those two innings aptly explain why the
Rangers were the Washington Generals and the Yankees were the
Globetrotters. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte wriggled through a jam with runners on second and
third with no outs to keep the Yankees' deficit at 1-0 in the top
of the fifth. In the bottom of the fifth, the Yankees tied the
score when Scott Brosius lined a double off the left-field fence to
score Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was not that simple. Rusty Greer, who lost Ledee's
liner in the lights in the opener, played Brosius' blast as if he
were a skateboarder trying for degree of difficulty points. Greer
rushed back to the warning track, lost sight of the ball, then
climbed the wall and flung his glove toward where he thought the
ball might be. He missed it by a foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so tough to play out there,'' said Ledee, the Yankees'
left fielder. ``You're always looking into the lights and trying to
find the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the Rangers are about to have their season ended by
the Yanks for the third time in the last four seasons. Ledee, who
was a World Series hero with two months of major league service
last season, will continue scooting along with the Yankees. Like
Jeter, Ledee is the anti-Torre in October.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out in his first two at-bats against Helling,
Ledee calmly batted with runners on first and third in the eighth.
He roped a 2-2 pitch down the right-field line that tailed to the
right of the foul pole and missed being a three-run homer by about
10 feet. But Ledee exhaled and came back with a huge double that
dropped between Roberto Kelly and Juan Gonzalez, who both
approached the ball lackadaisically.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee listened to Torre before Game 1 and again after the
Yankees beat the Rangers, 8-0. Torre announced an optional workout
Wednesday but told Ledee it was not optional for him. Ledee knew
why.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Yankees played the Cleveland Indians in Game 6 of the
American League Championship Series last October, Torre held an
optional workout at Yankee Stadium. It is supposed to be an option
for veterans like Paul O'Neill, but Ledee recalled how Shane
Spencer missed the workout and Torre seemed upset.
</P>
<P>
   Torre asked Ledee if he had seen Spencer and Ledee shrugged. The
manager told Ledee, who had not started any post-season games, that
he would start in left field in Game 6. Ledee said he asked Torre
if he was starting because he was perturbed with Spencer and Torre
said, ``I don't know'' and walked away. The strategy worked as
Ledee went 6 for 10 with four runs batted in against San Diego,
remembering each word Torre uttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Ledee said, ``I still don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a fan inside Ledee, which is why he initiated a
discussion about the possibility of a Subway Series and said he
would love to play the Mets. He wore his Mets' T-shirt around
Salinas, P.R., until it became thinner then a paper towel. Without
provocation, Ledee reeled off the names of the 1986 Mets and said
he rooted for them because ``they were the team of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was mentioned to Ledee that he is part of the current
team of the moment, he remained silent for a few seconds. Ledee
pondered the description of the Yankees and said: ``I guess we are.
We should appreciate this.'' And he meant it.

HACKETT FLOATS ARIZONA QB RUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Arizona has done its best to avoid a quarterback
controversy by alternating Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins, so USC
coach Paul Hackett injected himself into the situation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big rumor is they're going to play one guy,'' Hackett
said. ``They're going with (Smith).''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett didn't say where he heard the rumor, but relished the
idea that the Wildcats would play only one quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great. It will disrupt the team,'' Hackett said.
``Half of the guys will be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether any of it was true was dubious. The rumor to go with
one quarterback certainly hadn't reached Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday night, Jenkins said he had not heard of any
change at the quarterback position, and that Wildcats coach Dick
Tomey never announces any decisions before the team meets at its
hotel on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky No.8: Someone in the USC secondary will have the
unenviable task of defending Arizona wide receiver Dennis
Northcutt, who has had a pair of 10-reception games and has 38
catches in five games. He is one of the leading candidates for the
Biletnikoff Award, which goes to the nation's top receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of placing one cornerback on Northcutt, however, USC
will stay in its normal defense. Northcutt will be defended by
whomever's side he lines up on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to play on Sundays,'' cornerback Kris
Richard said. ``He's going to be a challenge for us. A lot of the
offense is geared toward him. We're prepared for them to go to him
no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary coach Dennis Thurman said that for the second straight
week, true freshmen Darrell Rideaux and Kevin Arbet will be part of
the regular rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to play them,'' Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rideaux and Arbet have moved ahead of senior Tanqueray Clark and
sophomore Eric Reese on the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Precautionary measure: USC has hired a communications specialist
to take to Tucson and make sure there are no problems with the
headphones after they malfunctioned last week against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hired a whole team of people,'' Hackett joked. ``We're
going to need two vans to take everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill out: Sophomore safety DeShaun Hill will not make the trip
after experiencing problems with his back. Defensive tackle Ryan
Nielsen rested Thursday but is OK.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Windrell Hayes continued to make strides in
practice and should be near 100 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher to tailback? It appears sophomore Miguel Fletcher of
Alemany High may be going back to tailback after playing most of
last season at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher has been operating at tailback for several weeks on the
scout team.
</P>
<P>
   The white stuff: With a 12:30 p.m. kickoff and an expected
temperature of 95 degrees, USC will be fortunate to wear its white
road jerseys. Arizona will wear its navy blue jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, there's the edge,'' Hackett said.

FOR ERICKSON, CORVALLIS BEST STOP AFTER FORGETTABLE SEATTLE
TENURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Dennis Erickson was a little testy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to talk about that,'' the Oregon State coach
said, responding to a reporter's press conference question Monday
about his time in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was on a conference call from Corvallis, where the
Huskies play the Beavers Saturday but enough ice came through the
wires to put out a navigation warning to boats on Lake Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Folks here are OK with you.
</P>
<P>
   Calm down. No need to feel defensive.
</P>
<P>
   True, it wasn't a storybook departure last December, getting
fired with a year left on your contract as Seahawks coach. But even
though the decision was justifiable, your major flaw merely was
having mediocre results (OK, one other thing, but what's a DUI
among friends?).
</P>
<P>
   But as you and your 'bro from Snoho, Jim Lambright, discovered
two days later, mediocre just doesn't cut it anymore in these
parts. This is Microsoftburg, and if you're not out trampling the
world, you will be trampled.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Seahawks and Huskies went out in one week and
spent more on football coaching than China spends on birth control
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Scoreboard, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the tepid record, Dennis, there was also the law of
averages. Having hightailed it out of four previous jobs (Idaho,
Wyoming, Washington State and Miami), it was only a matter of time
before a job beat you out the door.
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing to feel bad about, particularly since it was
an NFL job. Lots of college coaches get sideways in the pros,
compared to the few (such as Jimmy Johnson and Tom Coughlin) who
thrive.
</P>
<P>
   The problem often seems to be one of command presence. Erickson
didn't have much of one.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sole reason for success in the NFL. But after
observing the demeanor of Mike Holmgren, as well as his most
successful Seahawks predecessor, Chuck Knox, not to mention NFL
stalwarts Bill Parcells, Mike Shanahan, Bill Cowher, Bill Walsh and
others, the words of one Seahawks player rang true:
</P>
<P>
   ``He never seemed comfortable here, never seemed in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long career spent in college coaching, Erickson moved to
the Seahawks expecting that the players would be men, and therefore
disciplined, self-motivated, organized and responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   The main difference between pro football players and college
football players is the pros have million-dollar contracts that
give them the incorrect impression that they are more bulletproof
than James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it takes a formidable, Goldfinger-like personality to
hose that idea. Erickson was a little too deferential, failing to
treat his players as the overgrown youngsters they often are.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Erickson had some reasons for never getting his,
pardon the expression, Behrings.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise nearly took away the primary reason for accepting
the Seahawk job _ its Seattle address. The relocation travail
screwed up his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although Paul Allen ended that, the franchise sale brought in
president Bob Whitsitt, who regarded Erickson as overmatched. His
ouster was plotted for most of two years before the come-from-ahead
flop last season made it easy.
</P>
<P>
   But Erickson's career crisis lasted all of two weeks. Although
many were surprised that he would allow himself to fall from the
NFL to Corvallis _ a distance previously covered only by NASA
spacecraft _ it was the ideal fit.
</P>
<P>
   College kids are typically intimidated by the head coach, who
has total control. The mere weight of the office gives Erickson all
the authority he needs.
</P>
<P>
   At Oregon State, he has a program more like his first three
head-coaching jobs _ on the fringe, dripping with despair. Because
of his success, the Beavers never cared that his fourth coaching
stop ended with the NCAA federales chasing him out of Miami, nor
that Cougars fans still haven't forgiven him for his 1988 walkout
the residue of which included a team grade-point average of 1.94.
</P>
<P>
   He won national championships with the Hurricanes in 1989 and
1991. Those rings are all the dazzled Beavers need to see. As they
say in Corvallis these days: There's nothing wrong with probation
that a bowl-game appearance can't fix.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before OSU's game last week against USC,
Erickson admitted the Seahawks job was a mistake for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it over again,'' he said, ``I probably wouldn't
have taken the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. The Seahawks might say the same thing about their
coaching offer. Then again, he never failed to keep Joey Galloway
happy, never traded Shawn Kemp for Vin Baker, never blew an
eighth-inning lead and didn't recruit Huskies during a quiet
period.
</P>
<P>
   His time here wasn't so bad. Nor was it especially good.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to stay mad at a beige wall. Sort of welcome back,
Dennis.

HOPE, ERICKSON SHINE ON OREGON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ It's Thursday morning and, fittingly, the sun
is trying to break through the clouds and shine on the football
program at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, anguish was the only thing that hung in
the air here. Saturday it will be replaced by optimism and
enthusiasm as well as orange and black balloons rising from the Van
Buren bridge and parking meters along Fourth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon State Beavers are 3-1 and have Dennis Erickson as
their leader, which means they also have hope.
</P>
<P>
   stars
</P>
<P>
   At the Big O restaurant on the corner of Fourth and Adams
streets, Floyd Hutchins has just polished off his daily muffin
while continuing to drain another cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock to us,'' Hutchins says, referring to the hiring
of Erickson last January. ``We never expected anybody of that
stature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big O is where you will find pancakes and omelettes and true
Beavers believers. If you stop in Saturday before the game against
Washington, most of the waitresses will be in orange and black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for Margie,'' says Sharon Stewart, who has been here
since 1990. ``She's blonde and says it doesn't match her
complexion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart whips out her scrapbook, which features a picture of
seven Beavers piling onto the Oregon ball carrier, Ricky Whittle,
during the 1994 Civil War. Naturally, however, Oregon State lost
that game, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   If you're talking about the Beavers, Stewart wants to be in the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Erickson,'' she says. ``The electricity he ignites in
the team is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart goes on in detail about her favorite Beavers
paraphernalia, which includes a big orange parka and a pin that
shows a Beaver choking a Duck.
</P>
<P>
   Then she refers to Jess Lewis, explaining his impact on one of
Oregon States most memorable games, a 3-0 victory over USC in the
mud in Parker Stadium in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the man,'' Stewart says. ``He is the man.''
</P>
<P>
   stars
</P>
<P>
   Jess Lewis is the man, all right, a very big man. He is
currently driving a white Dodge van, pulling a trailer with two
workers who are putting out garbage cans at Reser Stadium in
preparation for Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black Oregon State football sweatshirt, Lewis gets out
of the van and relates what the Beavers' resurgence has meant to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been fun,'' he says. ``A lot of people hadn't given up on
Oregon State. But you can only take so many hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was the defensive lineman in 1967 who made a game-saving
tackle on O.J. Simpson after the Juice had broken free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different versions of that story,'' Lewis says. ``I
was playing against Ron Yary, and he had me blown off the line so
far, all I had to do was fall in front of O.J. and he tripped over
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis went on to play professionally with the Houston Oilers,
New Orleans Saints and Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He developed an
addiction to metha-amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a recovering drug addict,'' he admits. ``I've been 10
years clean and sober.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to handling operational duties around Reser Stadium,
Lewis counsels student athletes and teaches a health class called
Drugs in Sports. Growing up in nearby Aumsville, he has come back
to give back, and now the Beavers are rewarding Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real exciting,'' he says. ``We needed some change to
make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   All around him, change is evident. The Valley Football Center
houses a weight room and state-of-the-art coach. Reser Stadium has
a new artificial surface.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the softball field where an indoor practice
facility will start being constructed in January. In another
direction are 900 orange parking curbs with nameplates for donors
and other Very Important Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to field another call on his cell phone, Lewis
says: ``I love this place.''
</P>
<P>
   stars
</P>
<P>
   Outside Gill Coliseum, Dee Andros is waiting for his ride to an
Oregon Hall of Fame luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind him is the ramp that Andros used to run down,
leading the Beavers onto the field. His big orange outfit and ample
frame prompted sportswriter Harry Missildine to call Andros ``The
Great Pumpkin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' Andros says. ``People didn't know who Dee Andros
was, but they knew who The Great Pumpkin was.''
</P>
<P>
   They knew who the Beavers were, too. Andros coached during the
Beavers' glory years, the 1960s, a decade in which Oregon State
never had a losing season and went to the Rose Bowl in 1964. He
also coached in the '70s, when all of the awful began.
</P>
<P>
   For 28 consecutive years, the Beavers have been losers. Decades,
coaches, time _ they all changed, but the Beavers never have. Until
now, after Mike Riley lit the match and Erickson stoked the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we made the announcement of Denny, it gave us
instant recognition,'' Andros says. ``I've never seen spirit any
higher than it is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides having an energetic new coach, Andros says facilities
are the key to building and sustaining a winning program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't mean that much when I was having my heyday,'' he
says. ``In 1974, I had a great athlete (recruit) come in here who
said: ``Coach, I think the world of you and your town, but we have
better facilities at my high school.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beaver booster Bert Babb drives up in his Lincoln Town Car and
Andros hops in. Babb was at that game in '67, sitting six seats
away from California Governor Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With about three or four minutes left, he walked out,'' Babb
says. ``Everybody was really giving him the raspberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have fun in those days,'' Andros says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have fun again,'' Babb replies.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At practice Thursday afternoon, Erickson runs the Beavers
through a series of drills, looking fit and ready himself in his
black hat, black top and black shorts.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't talking today, having already spoken earlier this week
about Seattle, Seattle, Seattle and the Seahawks, Seahawks,
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   So everyone else talked about the coach's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to win,'' says his mother, Mary, from her home in
Everett. ``I know he tries hard. He seems to be happy now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Dennis happier,'' says offensive coordinator
Tim Lappano. ``To go from where you weren't wanted to where you
are, well, it does a man good.''
</P>
<P>
   But will he stay? Signs say yes. Erickson bought a
half-a-million-dollar home in the Lewisburg Hills overlooking the
Willamette Valley and put $100,000 of improvements into it.
</P>
<P>
   On his way home, athletic director Mitch Barnhart offers his own
opinion on the car phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me: `I'm a Northwest guy and I want to stay in the
Northwest. I also want to put my signature on a program,'''
Barnhart said. ``There is no better story in college football than
Oregon State getting this thing turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Erickson, Barnhart has had a major influence on Oregon
State athletics. He is marketing the teams and finding big
supporters like Al and Pat Reser, renaming Parker Stadium after
receiving a $5 million donation.
</P>
<P>
   He raised ticket prices, wanting to ``create value to the
program,'' believing people should pay more to watch the Beavers
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That told the student athletes it was worthwhile for them to
be trying,'' Barnhart says.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Andros era, Oregon State drew 12,803 fans for
its game against Stanford in 1975. Nearly that many fans traveled
to Oregon State's first game this year at Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Reser Stadium has not been sold out for a non-Civil War game
since 1984 against Washington. Every seat will be taken Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart also helped introduce ``Fan Fair,'' which precedes
every Beavers home game on Parker Plaza. It's a family event with
games, structured to appeal to youngsters who eventually will make
up the new fan base.
</P>
<P>
   Apathy can't be found in Corvallis anymore. Most of the
rejuvenation is credited to the man in the black outfit who was
unacceptable in Seattle before being embraced here.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bowl anyone?
</P>
<P>
   ``This place would be rocking,'' says Stewart back at the Big O.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just waiting,'' Lewis says. ``He's the kind of guy
who can make it happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ In a fluke bit of scheduling, ring announcer Michael
Buffer will introduce the Mighty Ducks before tonight's home opener
against Dallas at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   After the events of last Saturday's season opener in Dallas,
which resulted in the suspension of Ducks Ruslan Salei, Pascal
Trepanier and Jim McKenzie, and the verbal response of the Stars,
Don King might have promoted the game as Blood Feud III.
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne says he understands Dallas' emotional reaction to
the injuries to Mike Modano and Darryl Sydor, but he doesn't think
the two teams are getting ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, along with Paul Kariya, could be a target if the Stars
are looking for revenge, but the winger believes calmer heads will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be just another game,'' said Selanne, who took
a vicious elbow from former Dallas defenseman Craig Ludwig that led
to a wild brawl late in the 1997-98 season. ``The league will have
its eye on it. If guys do anything stupid, they are going to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock and winger Brett Hull have been
outspoken about the Ducks' perceived dirty play, and Anaheim coach
Craig Hartsburg has made it clear that's hardly the reputation his
team wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be known as a team that's hard to play against,''
he said. ``But we don't want to be known as a cheap or dirty team.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even former Ducks defenseman Jamie Pushor, now a member of
the Stars, took a shot at his ex-teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what kind of message they were trying to send,''
he told a Dallas newspaper. ``(But) it's not going to scare us. To
me, it was just a message that they didn't want to win the hockey
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim goalie Guy Hebert says the Ducks can't worry about what
Dallas thinks and said he believes they might be able to use the
Stars' anger to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully that will work as a distraction to them,'' he said.
``We have to get back to playing our system. That is a more
important issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Ducks have yet to score a goal in losses to Dallas
and Phoenix and are in the midst of continuing a disturbing October
trend. Anaheim is 14-34-11 in the first month of the season since
joining the NHL in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we've had slow starts,'' said Selanne. ``It's
something I'd like to know too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to think positive, we need one good game to get our
confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg expects to see a different (Ducks) team against
Dallas, but only if it is willing to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work ourselves out of it (the slump), not hope
ourselves out of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim coach said he isn't concerned with the lack of
scoring _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mindset is to score, you end up getting less,'' he
said. ``If you go out and check... (and are) a good solid team, the
chances will come. You have to worry about the process.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 20 players on the roster _ the suspended players can't
be replaced by minor-league callups _ Hartsburg's flexibility is
limited, so much so that he joked he was going to play.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg doesn't plan on changing the forward lines, but he is
planning to reunite Jason Marshall and Kevin Haller on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to establish a pair to play against the other team's
top lines,'' he said. ``We got away from that, but we've got to get
back to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and Haller were the Ducks' top defensive pairing last
season.

ANDERSON PERKS UP CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Representing the people of L.A. for at least one
season is Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In unwittingly promoting a litigious theme, Anderson has
encouraged his new Clippers teammates and coaches to refer to him
as ``DA.''
</P>
<P>
   It serves, because the burden of proof is his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to play hard, help the team win and put up a lot
of numbers,'' said Anderson, an explosive, 6-foot-5 shooting guard
acquired Aug.4 from Cleveland in what seems like the bonanza half
of Lamond Murray's sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, chosen by the Cavaliers with the 13th pick in the 1997
NBA draft, averaged 11.3 points in 104 games over two seasons in
Cleveland. But the right knee that disrupted his senior year at
Kentucky conspired with a logjam of high-priced Cavaliers shooting
guards to strangle some of his pro production.
</P>
<P>
   The leg is sound now, but the Cavaliers thought the
contract-extension goal of Anderson and his agent Tevester Scott of
rapper Master P's No Limit Sports agency was a bit pricey.
</P>
<P>
   When they traded him, he didn't exactly land on ``The Price Is
Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing is to change that,'' said Anderson of the negative
vibe that surrounds the Clippers. But perhaps even more ferocious
than the franchise's history of losing is its tradition of being
stingy with a buck. It is assumed that even a spectacular season
from Anderson would be insufficient to hold sway with owner Donald
T. Sterling's checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my decision,'' Anderson said. ``But I can't just
say I'm going to play here one year and then leave. A lot of things
can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good,'' coach Chris Ford said of Anderson. ``He's
very athletic, he makes good decisions with the ball and can play
multiple positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The appreciation is reciprocal so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this a lot,'' Anderson said of his first week with the
Clippers. ``Everyone has a willingness to work. There's a lot of
quickness and speed and a new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it's supposed to be.''

RANGERS FLOP, HOPE FOR HITS OFF BROADWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The game was a thriller, a pitching duel taut with
suspense and drama from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The result, however, was the same and the Rangers, despite Rick
Helling's performance, are going back to Arlington on the brink of
elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees pushed them to that point because Andy
Pettitte pitched just a little bit better than Helling in shutting
down the Rangers. Not that stopping the Rangers' offense is rare in
the playoffs, but Pettitte's performance gave the Yankees a 3-1
victory Thursday night in Game 2 of their American League Division
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick couldn't have pitched a better game, and we couldn't do
the things we needed to do to pick him up,'' Rangers shortstop
Royce Clayton said. ``It's an indescribable feeling. You go out, do
all you can, and it wasn't enough. It's a terrible feeling; no
other way to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Rangers down 2-0 in the best-of-five series.
Game 3 is scheduled for Saturday night at The Ballpark in
Arlington, where the Rangers begin their quest to be the fourth
team in history to rally from two games down to win a best-of-five
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just outpitched us and outplayed us,'' Helling said.
``They got the big hit when they needed it, and Andy made the big
pitch when he needed to. It was a tough loss. If we win, we have
them right where we want them, going home tied 1-1 and the
home-field advantage. Now we have to win three in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling held the Yankees to one run on three hits through six
innings but faltered in the seventh. Tino Martinez drew a
five-pitch walk with one out then raced to third on a full-count
hit-and-run single through the right side by Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee followed with a fly ball into right-center, and
center fielder Roberto Kelly couldn't run it down. Instead it fell
for a double, bringing home Martinez with the go-ahead run. Helling
was lifted at that point, having thrown 124 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt better in the seventh inning than I did in the sixth
inning,'' Helling said. ``Like I've said, if you get tired in a
game like this, something is wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did get a run Thursday night, on Juan Gonzalez's
fourth-inning home run, giving them a 1-0 lead. But the rest of the
game was just an extension of the offensive miseries that have
beset the Rangers in five consecutive Division Series losses to the
Yankees going back to last year.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you scoring at home, it's now two runs in 45
innings, and eight consecutive playoff losses to the Yankees, going
back to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating and disappointing,'' outfielder Rusty Greer
said. ``We just have to get more hits with runners on base, simple
as that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most painful memory from this game will be the fifth inning
when the Rangers blew a great chance to add to their lead. Kelly
led off with a single, and Lee Stevens lined a ground-rule double
over the left field fence, putting runners on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers failed to score. Mark McLemore, after getting
ahead 3-0 in the count, struck out on a 3-2 pitch, Clayton bounced
out to third baseman Scott Brosius and Greer struck out on a 3-2
cut fastball in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt, right there,'' McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get the job done,'' Clayton said. ``There's no
reason for it. He wasn't dominating. He wasn't even around the
strike zone. We helped him out. We just couldn't get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The second inning was another wasted opportunity. Rafael
Palmeiro and Todd Zeile led off with singles, but Kelly struck out
and Stevens hit into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're better than us,'' Helling said. ``I
think we're as good as anybody in baseball. They've just executed
better. It's as simple as that. They get the big hit when they have
to, and they make the big pitch when they have to.''

LAUSD SUPERINTENDANT TESTIFIES BEFORE COMMITTEE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Ruben Zacarias
told an independent commission he would consider a scaled-down
Belmont Learning Center if environmental problems persist and
cleanup costs climb too high.
</P>
<P>
   But Zacarias also said he favors completing the nation's
costliest high school atop the former oil and gas field, if it can
be done safely for students, staff and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the completion and eventual opening of the project,
but only if one critical condition is met: The Department of Toxic
Substance Control must declare the site safe for occupancy by
students and staff,'' he told the Belmont Commission Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to take months for those tests of potentially
explosive methane and deadly hydrogen sulfide gas in the soil to be
completed.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is scheduled to recommend to the school board
whether to proceed with the $200 million school on Oct. 20.
Zacarias appeared before the commission as one of dozens of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said he is now considering whether to use ``only a
portion of the property where it appears there is less toxicity.''
He said his approach to the site is being shaped by continuing
preliminary probes that show high readings of hydrogen sulfide in
the soil in some locations. He also said he is unwilling to spend
unlimited amounts of funds to safeguard the entire 35 acres.
</P>
<P>
   A source said Zacarias has been talking with top district
officials about completing only a portion of the school, which is
just over half finished, as an annex to the current Belmont High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``By narrowing the scope, the remediation of a smaller portion
might be less costly and easier to monitor,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Another option being discussed by district officials is to build
a smaller high school or middle school where administrators are now
lodged at a downtown site known as ``The Hill,'' and to move those
1,500 staff members to Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Belmont have complained that while acceptable
exposure rates for toxics such as hydrogen sulfide have been
determined for adults, they have not been set for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, I believe we must be flexible,''
Zacarias told the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Beckman said Zacarias' testimony underscored
the remaining uncertainty in judging the fitness of Belmont for a
school site.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in a series of tests reported Wednesday by the Daily
News showed elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide in some monitoring
wells in the ground. Zacarias said the test series confirm ``that
environmental conditions at Belmont are dynamic, not static.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckman said the commission will have to make its decision
taking that environmental uncertainty into account.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's executive director Ira Reiner, who requested
Zacarias' testimony, criticized the superintendent for his
responses, saying they did not address major concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said he believes the district's staff is paralyzed when
it comes to making decisions on Belmont, and he is worried they
will not be able to properly monitor the site if the project is
completed. Reiner cited bills from an environmental consultant he
said the district delayed paying for months as evidence of
ineptness.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said he was unaware of any billing problems, but said
he has put in place a new team to oversee Belmont's environmental
reviews and any future construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``An extraction system and a membrane barrier are only as
effective as the people who ensure that they are maintained
properly on an ongoing basis,'' he said, adding the district and
state toxics officials will guarantee the site will be monitored
for the life of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said that if the school or any portion of it opens,
parents and students will be fully briefed on the toxic situations
and what steps are being taken to remediate them.
</P>
<P>
   And while opposing granting a blanket waiver for students who
wanted to attend another school because of health concerns, he said
such waivers would be considered on a case-by-case basis.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE good news is that the Braves can't run Kevin Millwood out there
every game.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that Ken Caminiti probably can't keep up his
one-a-day homer pace, either.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that if the Astros are going to score enough runs in
the rest of this Division Series to overcome Atlanta's trophy case
full of Cy Young Awards, it will require at least an appearance by
the two biggest cogs in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Same song, third verse.
</P>
<P>
   This is starting to sound as familiar as a Christmas carol.
Silent Night
</P>
<P>
   Two games in, and the numbers are eerily similar to 1997 and
1998. Biggio and Bagwell are a combined 2-for-16 at the plate _ one
hit apiece.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Killer Fleas.
</P>
<P>
   In nine playoff games against the Braves and Padres, they are
8-for-65. Bagwell is hitting .121 and Biggio .125 Which are nice
numbers if you're a supermodel on an eating binge.
</P>
<P>
   For the Astros, they have become the Killer Breeze, an icy wind
blowing through a gaping hole at the top of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   At least this is one problem nobody can blame on Derek Bell.
He's not even on the field, and to date his offer of cash bonuses
for big hits has not awakened the biggest _ and most critical _ of
all the Astros' bats.
</P>
<P>
   If Biggio doesn't get on base, there isn't much for Bagwell to
drive in. If Bagwell isn't driving the ball and collecting RBIs, it
is far less threatening for the Braves to deal with Carl Everett
and Caminiti down below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure isn't hard for me to write their names in the lineup
every day and send them out there,'' said manager Larry Dierker.
``Biggio and Bagwell are who they are, and you don't question their
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the long season, we would, of course, never
get to where we are without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, things can and do change in a short series. But it stands
to reason that if we are ever going to go where we want to go in
the playoffs, well, yes, we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an alcoholic goldfish needs to swim in a bowl of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of big hits, one huge inning. Would that break the dam
and ease the pressure?
</P>
<P>
   It is a painful dilemma. All season long, the Astros are nothing
at all without them. Now, in the postseason, they are nothing
special without them. Not a team that can make a World Series run.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say they haven't contributed to the 1-1 split.
After struggling with his glove down the stretch, Biggio has been
solid at second base. And Bagwell made a couple of big defensive
plays in Game 2 alone.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't point the cameras at Cameron Diaz for her ability
to recite the multiplication tables, and if the Astros are ever
going to get the playoff monkey entirely off their backs, the
Killer B's will have to at least inflict a few bruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can win some games without them,'' Dierker said. ``But when
they're hitting, they give us the ability to win games easily,
without having to depend on all the rest being perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   There have always been players who thrive in the postseason.
Reggie Jackson was Mr. October. Caminiti's bat comes around as
regularly as Halloween. But there also have been big names who have
struggled in the spotlight. Dave Winfield was Mr. May.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the difference, of course, is in the pitching. It is
consistently better at this time of year. If you're not facing Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz or Kevin Brown, then it's a
Millwood stepping up to carve out a one-hitter with surgical
precision. In other words, there are few gimmies and it is up to
the hitters to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the course of the long regular season, guys can put up
big numbers by hitting bad pitches off bad pitchers,'' Dierker
said. ``But sometime or another in the playoffs, you've got to
start hitting good pitches from good pitchers. It can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hitter doesn't tie himself up in mental knots.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his cliches and low-key demeanor in public, Biggio is
outgoing and vocal within the confines of the team. When he
struggles at the plate, he becomes overaggressive, lunging at the
ball. He has not drawn a walk or tried a bunt to get himself on
base, where his speed is a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell is always controlled and stays with his own program when
trying to find his way out of a slump _ gritting his teeth,
swinging harder, yet remaining the stoic.
</P>
<P>
   However, both can be tortured souls. Both internalize
everything. Both become emotional Krakatoas. What works for them
most of the time can also work against them when things get tight.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than just a few good pitches from a few good
pitchers. It's a trend and a disturbing one that again threatens to
keep the Astros from getting past the doorstep of October.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The road to the World Series is hardly an HOV lane. It's more like
the West Loop at rush hour _ slow progress, but progress
nonetheless.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just ask the Atlanta Braves, who have just one World Series
championship to show for seven consecutive previous trips to the
playoffs this decade. Odds are if the Astros keep reaching the
postseason, they eventually will reach the ultimate goal, too.
</P>
<P>
   But until they do, there will be doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when your playoff resume doesn't include a single
series victory.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the Astros are in control of their best-of-five
National League Division Series, which is tied at a game apiece.
The next two games are in Houston, and the Astros will send their
best pitcher, Mike Hampton, to the mound today in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   But conventional wisdom doesn't seem to be on the Astros' side
in this instance. The prevailing commentary regarding the remainder
of this series has revolved around the Braves' extensive playoff
experience and their history of playing well at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   There's also talk about how easily the Braves could reel off a
pair of victories behind former Cy Young Award winners Tom Glavine
and John Smoltz over the next two days, and pitcher of the decade
Greg Maddux is available if Game 5 is necessary Sunday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there is little talk about the Astros and
their chances of pulling off a first-round upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because we're playing the Braves,'' Astros first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``We're playing the Braves and their
mystique. The Braves obviously have a great team, and they've been
in this situation a lot more than we have. No one expects us to
beat them except us, and we really believe we can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go back and look at the newspapers from 1997 (when the
Astros were swept by the Braves in a Division Series), and I know I
said I thought we could beat the Braves back then. But to be
honest, deep down inside, I didn't feel like we were good enough to
beat them. But we're a different team now _ a better team _ and I
really believe we can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won one of the first two games against the Padres in
their 1998 Division Series, but the next two games were in San
Diego and the series never returned to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Astros have a chance to make the home-field
advantage work for them.
</P>
<P>
   A near-sellout crowd is expected today at the Astrodome, where
the Astros haven't played since clinching the NL Central Division
title Sunday behind a strong effort from Hampton and a vocal crowd
that made the atmosphere uneasy for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros no doubt would take a repeat on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans are going to be fired up,'' second baseman
Craig Biggio said. ``This time of year is a lot of fun. We're
excited to have come out of Atlanta with a split and to have the
next two games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever has an advantage when they're playing against the
Braves. They're a great team; there's a reason they keep winning
year after year. But there are going to be two great pitchers out
there (today). It's going to be another good game, and hopefully
we'll come out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   That's usually the case when Hampton pitches. The Astros won 29
of his 34 starts this season, and he led the majors with a
remarkable .846 winning percentage. In other words, Hampton is the
man the Astros want on the mound when they most need a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But because neither team is in position to eliminate the other,
today's game is more pivotal than critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the playoffs, so obviously every game is a big game,''
closer Billy Wagner said. ``But as far as I'm concerned, there's no
reason to put any extra pressure on ourselves, and to me, that's
where pressure comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans can't put pressure on you; the media can't put
pressure on you; no one can put pressure on you except yourself. We
just need to relax and play the way we know how to play. If we do
that, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the expectations, there's no reason for the underdog
Astros to be anything but relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody figured we would be in this situation anyway,'' center
fielder Carl Everett said. ``I guess it's because we haven't done
too well in the playoffs the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we've done in the past doesn't mean anything right
now. The only thing that matters is winning two more games. If we
do that, who cares about the past?''
</P>
<P>
   Having been down that road before, the Astros are more
interested in charting a new path.

ONE RUN WAS ALMOST ENOUGHT FOR HELLING

NEW YORK _ This Rick Helling is one lucky fellow. Once a year, the
Rangers come to the Bronx and score a run in the baseball
postseason. But they only score it for Rick.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No other pitcher is so honored. Helling gets his run and his
thrill. Everybody else gets a taxi ride with the foreign cabbie who
has a fake passport, no Mapsco and an apparent death wish.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, however, is not exactly appreciative. Doesn't he
realize that one run is better than none? And none is the norm for
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Economic riches appear to be rather sparse in the Bronx, unless
you happen to own a razor-wire company or be a pitcher for the
Yankees. It doesn't matter what kind of pitcher, just be fortunate
enough to have manager Joe Torre send you out against the Rangers.
Like the razor-wire tycoon, you are guaranteed to cash.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Andy Pettitte was the chosen one last night.
Pettitte must live with the disgrace of allowing one run a year to
the Rangers in the postseason. But the trade-off is that Pettitte
has now been the winning pitcher in consecutive Game 2s of the
American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   These Game 2s have crushed the Rangers, since they also happened
to have lost the Game 1s.
</P>
<P>
   Another playoff exit was assured for the Rangers last night in a
3-1 defeat. The only hanging question is will it be Sweep II. A
trip to Texas, an off-day today, then a Saturday-night encounter at
The Ballpark in Arlington will determine that.
</P>
<P>
   But besides being gifted with his traditional one run, Helling
also pitched his guts out last night. Unfortunately, the
right-hander has been down this dead-end road before.
</P>
<P>
   Helling lost, 3-1, last night. A year ago in Game 2 at Yankee
Stadium, he lost, 3-1. Pettitte bested him both times. Pettitte did
not outpitch him either time. But Pettitte has the support of a
batting order that is manly, and even when not overly productive,
still gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   There is always overwhelming concern in North Texas precincts
about the Rangers being mismatched against the Yankees in the
rotation department. But that was not the case last night, nor was
it a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Helling again gave his team every opportunity to come out of New
York with a split, and head home with renewed hope in the series.
But against the Yankees, the Rangers' batting order continues to be
hopeless and homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The next guy from Keller or Lake Worth who says the Rangers just
don't have the pitching, slap him right across the teeth. There is
no truth to what seems to pass as the truth. Just like there is no
chance for the Rangers to have postseason survival against the
Yankees, not with the lightweight hitters who freeze up in the
October spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in our hearts we can play with those guys, but until
we start doing it, there is going to be doubt,'' said manager
Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doubt,'' of course, is putting it way too mildly.
</P>
<P>
   All Helling needed to do last night was throw a shutout. And he
actually had that kind of stuff, and was that kind of bulldog. But
nursing a 1-0 lead against the patience of the New York hitters
makes for a long, hard evening.
</P>
<P>
   While being in command, Helling's pitch count also kept climbing
and climbing. The Yankees' hitters made him work for every out, and
every strikeout, which totaled eight in the first five innings.
</P>
<P>
   With a leadoff runner at first, Helling had two strikeouts in
the fifth before going to a full-count on Scott Brosius. The next
pitch to Brosius came in fat, and he drilled it off the left-field
wall, scoring Tino Martinez from first.
</P>
<P>
   Helling took the 1-1 deadlock into the seventh, having thrown
101 pitches. A one-out walk to Martinez invited trouble, and was a
sure sign Helling was tiring. Oates, however, had more faith in
Rick than his bullpen, and that's understandable. Chili Davis,
however, singled Martinez to third, and then Ricky Ledee popped a
double into right center, giving the Yankees all they needed _ a
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-luck Helling departed at that point, having to know
privately there was no chance for his offense to rally.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that Ledee and Brosius did the damage to Helling
was yet another flashback to a year ago. In that 3-1 defeat in
1998, Brosius had two runs batted in, and the No. 8 batter in that
game (Shane Spencer) drove in the other run.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom-of-the-order blues low-lighted last October's exit by the
Rangers. Same old story, and same old lack of runs this time,
except for Helling getting his usual one. nn

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They got a fine effort from their starting pitcher.
They scored a run and actually had a lead. And then, of course, the
wheels came off for the Texas Rangers. Eight games into one of the
cruelest losing streaks in postseason baseball, can there be any
other way?
</P>
<P>
   Failing to hit with men on base, the Rangers went down again to
the New York Yankees on Thursday, losing Game 2 of their American
League Division Series at Yankee Stadium 3-1. The series now shifts
to Arlington, for games Saturday and possibly Sunday, with the
Yankees leading the best-of-five series 2-0 and the Rangers facing
the prospect of having to beat both Roger Clemens and David Cone to
force a fifth game.
</P>
<P>
   In losing to the Yankees for the eighth consecutive time in
postseason play, the Rangers wasted the effort of starter Rick
Helling, who gave up two runs and five hits in the 6 innings he
worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers broke a 25-inning postseason scoreless streak when
Juan Gonzalez homered off Yankees starter Andy Pettitte in the
fourth to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were able to win by scratching out runs off Helling
in the fifth and seventh innings, Ricky Ledee's single bringing in
the go-ahead run, and added another when reliever Mike Venafro
walked in a run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In 7 innings, Pettitte allowed seven hits, didn't give up a walk
and pitched out of serious trouble in the second and fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Pettitte's performance) is what I remember about Andy,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``He makes big plays, big pitches.
He walked that tightrope in '96. He got into jams and got out of
them. You talk about hitching it up. ''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to juice up their offense, which produced only two hits
in Game 1, the Rangers made several adjustments Thursday. Manager
Johnny Oates tinkered with the top of his lineup, making Royce
Clayton and Rusty Greer his Nos. 1 and 2 hitters, and tried to give
his players a new mindset at the plate as well.
</P>
<P>
   Oates thought Rangers hitters, normally free swingers, had been
too selective at the plate in Game 1, taking pitches they usually
can hit, as if they were trying to emulate the heralded patience of
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some hits, got some hits early,'' Oates said after
Thursday's game, ``and just weren't able to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, in the second inning, the Rangers found
themselves in Game 1 mode. After Rafael Palmeiro and Todd Zeile
opened the inning with back-to-back singles, Roberto Kelly struck
out and Lee Stevens dribbled a broken-bat grounder up the middle
that Derek Jeter turned into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the fourth, the Rangers broke through. With one out
and nobody on, Gonzalez took a 1-2 pitch from Pettitte and lined it
into the lower deck in left. After 25 scoreless innings of Division
Series play against the Yankees, a streak dating to the fifth
inning of last year's 3-1 loss in Game 2, the Rangers had a genuine
run and a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got their first hit of the night in their half of
the inning, Jeter's one-out double to right-center. With the
stadium energized for the first time since the beginning of the
game, Paul O'Neill battled Helling from 0-2 to 3-2 before grounding
to Clayton, the Texas shortstop, whose throw beat Jeter at third.
Helling then struck out Bernie Williams to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers again had Pettitte on the ropes in the fifth. Kelly
started the inning with a single. Stevens followed with a double to
left. But Pettitte was able to battle his way out of it, striking
out Mark McLemore after falling behind 3-0, getting Clayton to tap
to third and striking out Greer, swinging, on a 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees then made it a 1-1 game. Tino Martinez opened the
New York fifth with a single. Helling struck out the next two
hitters, Chili Davis and Ledee, but couldn't get past Scott
Brosius, the Yankees' No. 8 hitter, who brought in the run with a
double off the wall in left.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' wasted opportunities loomed large when Helling finally
ran out of gas in the seventh and the Yankees moved ahead on
Ledee's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez walked with one out, the only walk issued by Helling,
and moved to third when Davis grounded a single to right. Ledee
then golfed one to right-center that fell in for a single and
scored Martinez with the go-ahead run.

RANGERS' HELLING HAS NO HELP IN LOST CAUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
NEW YORK _ The Lone Ranger showed up at Yankee Stadium last night,
ready and willing to ride to the rescue. His trusty sidekick Tonto
was a miserable no-show again. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Outmanned and outgunned, our hero went down fighting. But down
he went just the same. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All Rick Helling needed was a little help from his friends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone to watch his back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone to give him a little moral support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone, for crying out loud, to contribute a clutch hit, drive
in a critical run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His, however, was a lonely one-man stand in the cold Bronx
night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, this October nightmare will soon be over. The
Yankees' 3-1 victory gives them a 2-0 lead in this best-of-five
Division Series, which makes a brief stop in Texas on Saturday
night before the Yanks once again move on to bigger and better
things. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, as usual, have been no more annoying than a
meaningless pimple on the Yankees' pinstriped behinds, practically
invisible to the naked eye and soon forgotten. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' futility has become a baffling mystery, even to the
Yankees and the arrogant provincial New York media that never
misses an opportunity to stroke the home team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A ticking time bomb,'' Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill says of
the Rangers' offense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Great. Maybe it'll go off next March, when it really matters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't do better than this,'' a New York columnist
snidely wrote yesterday, ``they don't get invited back.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insert gnashing of teeth here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But what can you say? The Rangers have left those of us who
believed that this would be the year they would finally put an end
to the Yankees' curse as defenseless as Helling was last night with
only Juan Gonzalez's solo home run in the fourth for support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is impossible,'' Helling said. ``We have a good
ballclub. It can be done. We've won three games in a row this year.
I'm sure the Yankees have lost three in a row this year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to conceive those two scenarios coming together at this
point, however, is beyond the most fertile imagination. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates shook up his lineup, moving Royce Clayton
to leadoff, Rusty Greer to the two hole and hitting Pudge Rodriguez
third. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got good vibes tonight,'' Oates confided before the
game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Must have been coming from that one lonely run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You always try to put zeros on the board,'' Helling said. ``It
would have been nice to throw a 1-0 shutout, but I don't think you
expect that to happen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's home run snapped the team's streak of consecutive
scoreless innings at 25. His line drive barely cleared a left-field
billboard advertising a popular camera and film company, a true
Kodak moment, if you will. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully someone snapped a picture, because it's not like these
things come along every day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were a pitiful 0-for-5 with runners in scoring
position, and their inability to break the game open in the fifth
after they put runners at second and third with no one out was the
contest's lynchpin moment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Kelly had lined a leadoff single to center, and Lee
Stevens drove an Andy Pettitte fastball on a slicing arc to left
field, where it caromed off the warning track and into the
left-field seats for a ground-rule double. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So who's due up? Second baseman Mark McLemore, the one guy Oates
tried to hide in his lineup by dropping him to ninth, thanks to a
postseason batting average (.104) so low you couldn't buy a cup of
New York coffee with it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But McLemore worked the count to 3-0, building hope in the
hearts of Rangers faithful. A base hit could score two runs and
give Helling, pitching well, a 3-0 lead. A walk would load the
bases for the top of the order with no one out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We get the guy \RMcLemore\S 3-0 and runners at second and
third and you're feeling good,'' Oates said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dream on. McLemore struck out flailing at Pettitte's backdoor
cutter. Clayton chopped an easy one-hopper to third baseman Scott
Brosius as the runners held. Greer struck out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Misery descended on the Rangers once again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good feeling when he struck McLemore out, especially
coming back from 3-0,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Getting
out of that inning and getting that third run in the eighth was
huge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fired up, the Yankees would tie the score in the bottom of the
fifth, and a tiring Helling, who started theseventh having thrown
104 pitches, finally coughed up the lead run in the seventh on
Ricky Ledee's run-scoring double to right center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Torre's right. The Yankees did add a third run in the eighth,
but huge? That's giving the Rangers way too much credit.
Essentially, they were dead after the fifth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were no Texas base runners in the final three innings.
Zero. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's frustration,'' a dejected Oates said. ``We know in our
hearts we can play with these guys, but until we start doing it,
there's always going to be doubts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even begin to start covering it, Kemo Sabe. &QL;

RANGERS SQUANDER OPPORTUNITIES IN CRITICAL FIFTH INNING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Right-hander Rick Helling provided the Rangers an
opportunity to return to The Ballpark in Arlington with the
best-of-five Division Series against the Yankees square at a
victory apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' potent lineup whiffed on the potential breakthrough
and doomed the American League West champions to a 3-1 loss
Thursday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore, shortstop Royce Clayton and left
fielder Rusty Greer failed to produce with runners aboard second
and third during the critical fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Those three at-bats would be the last the Rangers managed with a
runner in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly a key inning of the ballgame,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``That was probably the best opportunity
to have a big inning other than the first. You think you've got a
good shot at getting something going.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with such promise after a leadoff single by center
fielder Roberto Kelly and the ensuing double by first baseman Lee
Stevens. Despite no outs, neither crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who hit .163 this season against left-handers, stepped
into the batter's box hitting right-handed against Yankees
left-hander Andy Pettitte. Yankees manager Joe Torre played third
baseman Scott Brosius and shortstop Derek Jeter at normal depth and
pulled in the right side of his infield.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore took three consecutive pitches before Pettitte threw a
strike, and Oates gave his switch-hitting infielder the ``green
light'' on 3-1. McLemore fouled that pitch down the first-base line
to run the count full, and he swung through Pettitte's 3-2 delivery
for the inning's first out.
</P>
<P>
   It would be an ominous sign.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte induced a one-out ground ball on a 2-1 pitch from
shortstop Royce Clayton, who hit leadoff for only the third time
this season. Oates did not signal for the ``contact'' play, whereby
Kelly would break as soon as Clayton put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius fielded the ball cleanly and
retired Clayton at first base, and Kelly and Stevens remained in
scoring position for left fielder Rusty Greer. Pettitte again fell
behind in the count before working it full, and Greer swung through
a 3-2 breaking ball in the dirt to end the threat. nn

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Shandon Anderson had been told the Rockets planned to run
more. He believed it, too.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the reasons he had been attracted to the Rockets.
And it made sense. With a potential backcourt of Anderson and Steve
Francis, and with Cuttino Mobley likely to command minutes, you
run.
</P>
<P>
   But the image of the plodding Rockets remained. Fair or not, the
Rockets were regarded as a half-court, slow-down, post-up team. No
matter how convinced Anderson was the Rockets were ready to change
_ and he was convinced enough to sign with the Rockets as a bargain
free agent _ the image remained.
</P>
<P>
   It is gone now. After three days with Rudy Tomjanovich pushing
hard on the accelerator, Anderson and the Rockets know how serious
Tomjanovich was when he said he would pick up the pace on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew when you were playing the Rockets, they would throw
the ball to Hakeem (Olajuwon) or (Charles) Barkley and beat you
with the 3, and they're not going to hide it,'' Anderson said of
his previous three seasons in the NBA with the Jazz. ``With the
rule changes, you can't sit there and pound the ball. Rudy told me
he wanted more movement in the offense. But I didn't know he meant
this much running. Now I know he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd go up and down a little bit. But he wants us to
get up the floor every time. Every time. We can always set up in
the half-court. But we're going to get up the floor and try to get
the easy basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich always intended to get the Rockets in the open court
and to get them used to getting up and down the floor. But he began
camp by emphasizing the need to run to make it a habit. Players
always will run if they see a dunk waiting on the other end of the
court. Tomjanovich wanted them in flight before they had a chance
to look.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about the running game,'' he said.
``There's a lot of talk, but you have to consistently get up and
down the court. A split-second hesitation could take away a break.
We're trying to get them conditioned to push it down every time. We
can always slow down later in a tight game. We've made great
progress in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   The other benefit of quickly establishing that part of the
offense is it can then offer a better gauge of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a 50/50 deal,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We have to
put in our offense so we can have some offense we have to defend.
If you're running terrible offense, you're going to think you're
playing good defense. You get into that situation: `Are we that
good on offense or terrible on defense? Are we that good on
defense, or terrible on offense?'''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they are running, Tomjanovich wants the Rockets to be
able to quickly call on an ``early offense,'' a part of the game
that in recent seasons has all but disappeared from the NBA. When
the break does not generate a fast-break basket, Tomjanovich would
like the Rockets to quickly shift to a half-court set without
having to stop and call a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why nobody in the league does that,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``It's been either a fast break or a set play. It's something
that's been talked about. You have some sort of pattern as you
break. If the break is not there, you get into some sort of
pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Rockets believe the break will be there, if only
because they have the players to turn even a small opening into a
chance to outnumber an opponent on the other end of the court. If
the Rockets can keep up with Francis, he has shown he can get the
ball from one end to the other faster than anyone can backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to run as hard as you can to keep up with him,''
forward Don MacLean said. ``That's good. You want a point guard
that pushes it up and gets you a few easy buckets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play to your strengths. In the past, Dream
needed 25 shots a game. Dream isn't looking for that. You play with
your personnel. Steve Francis is going to be a great player.
Shandon Anderson is a proven scorer. You want those guys involved,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that the guys weren't involved before, but they were
dominant inside. Now, we're taking advantage of the other strengths
the Rockets have.''
</P>
<P>
   The inside strength offered no complaints. Olajuwon said ``it's
just basketball.'' The details, he said, do not matter if a team
leans on what works.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was ready for the Rockets to no longer lean so heavily
on him. If the image of Barkley is not of him filling a wing on the
break, he said he is ready to move away from the punishment that
comes with hand-to-hand combat in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't bring Steve Francis and Shandon Anderson in here to
walk the ball up the court,'' Barkley said. ``It helps everything
to run. Also, I don't want to have that pressure of having to bang
the whole game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to be up-tempo, get the running game going. What
we're going to have to really work on, when the break isn't there,
is a quick transition into offense, instead of slowing it down and
going to the half-court and having to bang the whole game. We
(Barkley and Olajuwon) don't want to be as productive as we have
been in the past. We can't be. This is going well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets who live to run were only too happy with the change.
For Anderson and Francis, the running Rockets are the only Rockets
they have known firsthand. For Mobley, a half-court point guard
with full-court finishing skills last season, the change is a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real nice,'' he said. ``We've got Bryce Drew, Matt
Maloney and Steve Francis pushing the rock; myself, Shandon, Walt
(Williams) and Stacey (Augmon) on the wing. It will cause a lot of
problems for a lot of teams. Any young player doesn't want to stand
around. We have too much energy. We want to play. I'm just loving
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Rockets, it might say more that they don't have to
be ``any young player'' to see so much potential in the change.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets made a healthy 46.2 percent of their shots last
season, ranking third in the NBA. Their average of 94.2 points per
game ranked seventh. But for the second consecutive season, the
Rockets had a first-round playoff exit.
</P>
<P>
   The quickness on the perimeter could improve the defense, but it
can also boost the Rockets' scoring and, Olajuwon said, their
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an advantage to have guys who can run and post up,''
Olajuwon said. ``You don't (pre)determine the style of basketball
until the players are in sync together, play good defense, get the
rebound, outlet pass, run the fast break, post up. That's
basketball. People try to separate the post-up game from the
running game. You need to do both. That wins championships.''

GREAT ESCAPES BY PETTITTE SECURED WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A free agent when the season ends, Andy Pettitte can
name his price after his performance in Thursday night's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte had trouble with his curveball and relied on his
two-seam fastball, working in and out of some tight jams that could
have sent him to the showers early. But, when he needed the big
out, he found more escape hatches than Houdini.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big game,'' said Pettitte, who won his sixth career
postseason game. ``Sometimes you are going to be good. We had a lot
of little things happen that a lot of people don't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether by his own ingenuity or courtesy of the continuing
futility of the Rangers' offense, Pettitte dodged two key, no-out
jams as the Yankees went on to win 3-1 and take a commanding 2-0
lead over the Rangers in the American League Division Series at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked that tightrope,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``When he was in jams, he didn't look like he would get out of,
he'd get out of them. You talk about hitchin' it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Two innings, the second and fifth, were crucial to Pettitte's
survival on a night when Rangers starter Rick Helling kept the
Yankees' offense as cold as the Bronx night air.
</P>
<P>
   In both innings, Pettitte brushed off back-to-back leadoff hits
to get out of danger with no runs scoring. The fifth was the key
inning when the Rangers started by putting runners on second and
third with no outs. Pettitte, once again emerging as a big-game
pitcher, set down the Rangers and gave his offense a chance to win
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte allowed only a fourth-inning solo home run to Juan
Gonzalez. He left in the eighth inning to a standing ovation. It
was just earlier this season when Pettitte was booed out of Yankee
Stadium and his name was often heard in trade rumors. This night,
he reassured everyone of his ability, going 71/3 innings and
allowing one run on seven hits. He walked none and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was awesome. There were a couple of jams he got out of,''
right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``Then we were able to squeak out
a couple of huge runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the score at 1-1 in the fifth on Scott Brosius'
double off the left-field wall and then scored the winning run on
Ricky Ledee's seventh-inning double, his second run-scoring double
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the defending champions are one game away
from sweeping the Rangers on a night when the Rangers got a strong
outing from starter Rick Helling.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will force the Rangers to beat Roger Clemens in Game
3 on Saturday, David Cone on Sunday, if necessary, and Orlando
Hernandez, who pitched an eight-inning, two-hitter in Game 1, in
what would be the decisive Game 5 back at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Pettitte made the difference between leading 2-0
and handing home-field advantage over to the Rangers.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WHAT Bob McNair's group has done in gaining ownership of the NFL's
32nd and, in all probability, last new franchise of our lifetime is
tantamount to winning the Super Bowl with a John Elway drive in the
game's final moments.
</P>
<P>
   There is one striking difference, though. When a team wins the
Super Bowl, it gets drunk, then goes on vacation for about six
months. In contrast, McNair and his weary associates were
essentially back in full pads preparing for two-a-day practices
Thursday, less than 24 hours after the NFL offered its blessing to
their record $700 million bid.
</P>
<P>
   A celebratory welcome-home news conference was held at noon, but
by midafternoon they were in meetings with investment bankers.
There's so much work to be done in a ridiculously short time it is
staggering. For example, the structural steel for the stadium and
its retractable roof must be ordered in less than two months, if
the building is to be completed by Aug. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife I'd see her in about four years,'' joked Steve
Patterson, the former Rockets and Aeros general manager who has
been McNair's only full-time executive-level employee throughout
the 2{ years he spent pursuing the franchise against what most
believed were impossibly long odds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, by gosh, the Houston (fill-in-the-blanks) are up and
running, with a toll-free phone number and a Web site online.
Regarding the latter, there were 200,000 hits the first hour. And
Houston, the more skeptical NFL owners would have had us believe,
lacks a passion for pro football?
</P>
<P>
   The McNair victory over LA's zoo full of 800-pound gorillas
stands as a tribute to the operation's preparedness, thoroughness
and, perhaps most important when it came to closing the deal,
mental toughness. The sorest of losers on the Left Coast are
calling McNair a fool for overpaying, but this was not a desperate
act by a desperate man by any means.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, however preposterous they appear, crunch nicely,
thanks to a clever financing structure in combination with the
NFL's license-to-print-money economics. Although McNair was in no
position to drive a hard bargain as he fended off California's
front-running dreamers, he got what he needed to get _ a guaranteed
future Super Bowl for Houston included _ when he needed to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding the advice of his inner circle of associates, he
demanded an answer Wednesday, not in November or March. That's why
it was decided a week ago to stop the haggling and put $700 million
on the table, take it or leave it.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cleveland Browns, working with prearranged terms, needed
six weeks to properly tweak their franchise agreement. McNair and
his people took only six days, and they were negotiating on the
fly.
</P>
<P>
   The document, by the way, is almost a foot thick. And it wasn't
handed over in full to the expansion committee until a half-hour
before it convened. McNair, not yet dressed for the day and groggy
from lack of sleep, according to witnesses, signed off on it
shortly before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't immediately handed over was the $70 million letter
of credit, the down payment the NFL had insisted upon. That was
given to commissioner Paul Tagliabue only after the expansion
committee formally had endorsed Houston's ironclad proposal over
the pie-in-the-sky LA schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, it wouldn't be an open-ended assurance of the
seriousness of Houston's intent, either. The letter of credit was
expressly written to expire at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to let them drag the process out any
longer,'' one of McNair's closest advisers said. ``The offer was
coming off the table if they hadn't reached a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer almost had come off the table around midnight Tuesday
when an attempt was made to remove the Houston-hosted Super Bowl
from the equation, a key element that had been negotiated into any
potential agreement during McNair's meeting at the NFL's offices
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   An unnamed league official claimed _ bogusly, for some reason _
a huge convention scheduled for the city in January 2004 would make
it impossible for the necessary number of hotel rooms to be
available for the ticket holders. Documents confirming Houston's
capacity to handle every fathomable requirement for a Super Bowl
hurriedly were faxed to Atlanta, and the storm blew over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could have been a deal-breaker for sure,'' said a McNair
associate.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Billy Shakespeare told us, all's well that ends well.
Apparently, the only thing with which McNair didn't leave Atlanta
was a guarantee from the NFL his football team would be a
participant in Houston's Super Bowl.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Some may think of it as trauma-induced amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite calls it a short memory.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is what keeps the 6-1, 205-pound sophomore coming
back strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas quarterback was under siege the entire afternoon last
Saturday against Kansas State, and it was obvious to all that he
would be harried by the Wildcats every time he dropped into the
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   But Applewhite wasn't fazed. No fear, no happy feet, no ducking
his head and pleading for mercy no, not Major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I was getting hit doesn't mean I wasn't going to
stand in the pocket,'' Applewhite said. ``I was going to stand in
there strong and try to complete the ball. So what if I get hit?
That's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly part of the Kansas State game. Applewhite
was sacked five times and took untold hits in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Because of K-State's defense, Applewhite had his worst college
game. He completed 19 of 37 passes for 271 yards and threw three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, standing fearlessly in the pocket led to three
fumbles. All told, the Wildcats turned six turnovers by Applewhite
into 26 points in a 35-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite's take on the game: ``Forget about it. Get ready for
OU.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see how well he heeds his own advice when the Longhorns
face Oklahoma on Saturday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have such a short-term memory,'' Applewhite said. ``That's
what you have to do as a quarterback. I don't even remember most of
the games last year. I remember some of them, but I don't remember
a whole lot about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People on the field that have to have the shortest memory are
the quarterbacks and the cornerbacks. If a cornerback gets beat on
a 40-yard bomb, he's got to turn right back around on the next play
and play man-to-man coverage again. You can't think about it (being
beaten). That's what separates good ones from bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   In just over a year on the job (16 starts), Applewhite has
proved to be one of the good ones.
</P>
<P>
   At his current pace, he will shatter every Texas passing record.
</P>
<P>
   He already holds or shares 19 school records, including average
yards per game (248.0), passing yards in a single game (408) and
longest pass play, a 97-yard touchdown toss to Wane McGarity in
last year's Red River Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   He has thrown for at least 200 yards and one touchdown in each
of his 16 starts (another record). But the last game on that list
was a subpar performance. It was so bad, in fact, that Applewhite
had trouble recalling one similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in seventh grade I had a bad game like this, but it
didn't make the papers,'' Applewhite joked, though he later would
say he never played that poorly in seventh grade. ``I would
consider it (Kansas State) my one bad game. There were some games
where I didn't play excellent but I didn't play bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my one bad game, but you can't have bad games. That's
the way I look at it. I can't have bad games if we want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A thinking man's quarterback because he has to be, thanks to
average size and arm strength, Applewhite hit the film room for
nearly three hours early Sunday morning after the K-State loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick; I didn't sleep,'' Applewhite said. ``It's
disappointing because you let yourself down. It's disappointing
because fans are upset, and that bothers you. You can't avoid that
as a player. You try to avoid listening and try to hope that all
the voices are benign, but they're not. You just kind of get over
it, and I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it a lot, and the only thing that kept coming
to my head was, You can't play that game over again, so shut up.
And I did. You'll never get that one back, so get ready for OU.
That's the only way to redeem ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to bouncing back, teammates believe Applewhite
accomplishes that from play to play, let alone game to game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's character in the way he's able to come back and regroup
and have control over the huddle and just keep it positive when
things aren't going well,'' split end Ryan Nunez said. ``Looking at
the film and some of the shots that he took, I got a lot of respect
for him and the things he goes through. The abuse that he gets on
and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll bounce back this week, and he'll be raring to go against
Oklahoma. So will everybody, but him in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to bounce back is but one thing that makes
Applewhite special. He intently breaks down every defense and knows
its tendencies. He's rarely caught off guard by a formation.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kansas State, which brought a multitude of blitzers from
all angles, could not surprise Applewhite. The biggest problem for
Texas was its offensive line didn't block well.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we give him time to throw the ball he's deadly, lethal back
there,'' Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   And a shoddy memory makes him even more deadly. Last week is
over. On to the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, you can't let K-State beat you twice,'' Applewhite
said. ``You have to get up, grow up and go out and play. And that's
what we're going to do.''

ROBITAILLE'S HAT TRICK LIFTS KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Luc Robitaille knows Andy Murray can only say so much.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie coach's buzzword for this season is accountability,
but without his top players buying into the program, Murray knows
there would be meltdowns along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, who lived through one in Wednesday's brutal loss to
Florida, responded Thursday with three power-play goals in a 5-2
victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   It gave him an NHL-leading six goals in just four games and
helped raise the Kings' record to 3-1 on their season-opening,
seven-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But it only tells part of the story.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, Murray, who was better known as a former high
school coach than the respected longtime assistant he really was,
went to Robitaille and captain Rob Blake to say they held the real
power.
</P>
<P>
   Murray needed them in better shape than ever and carrying a
positive message to younger teammates who became fractured last
year under former coach Larry Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille, once one of the league's premier scorers, had
rebounded from several down years in Pittsburgh and New York to
score 39 goals last season, including the 500th of his career. The
reason was his commitment to conditioning, which blossomed under
strength coach Joe Horrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way the team has played all around, but there is no
question of the weight Luc carries around here,'' said Blake, who
also scored a power-play goal. ``The guys see what he is doing on
the ice and it sets a tone. When you work that hard to get better,
other players follow.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the Kings' second line, which still does not have a
point in the first four games but which pressured Lightning goalie
Darren Puppa all night. Donald Audette hit the post late in the
second period with a ring that awoke the crowd of 10,614 at the Ice
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   Or Stephane Fiset, who was in goal Wednesday night when the
Panthers scored two goals in a 20-second stretch during the final
two minutes, then added an empty-netter to hand the Kings an
embarrassing 4-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, who started the first three games of the season, was
given Thursday night off, but entered a tie game to start the
second period after Jamie Storr strained his right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Blake scored 24 seconds into the period for the eventual winning
goal and Fiset stopped all 17 shots he faced the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   There were others, such as rookie defenseman Frantisek Kaberle,
who recorded two assists for his first NHL points. Even assistants
Dave Tippett (power play) and Mark Hardy (penalty killing) received
credit from Murray for pulling the team together after the coach
held a lengthy meeting earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, they helped erase the dismal memory from the night
before. But leading the way was Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals are the result of the hard work,'' Robitaille said.
``We have a good thing here, but we have to stay focused. Nobody
wanted to see what happened (Wednesday), but it was important to
see the team put it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen right away.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were flat for the first 10 minutes against Tampa Bay,
even trailing 1-0 on a goal by Stan Drulia, who hadn't scored an
NHL goal since Nov. 23, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, veteran defenseman Garry Galley bumped into Storr
just before Drulia's shot.
</P>
<P>
   Galley redeemed himself with his first goal of the season and
Robitaille made it 2-1 with 8:10 left in the first when he
rebounded a shot by Ziggy Palffy.
</P>
<P>
   Blake got his goal in the first minute of the second period and
Robitaille added his second by jamming the puck past Puppa late in
the period.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille completed the hat trick with 3:09 left in the game
when he attempted a pass to Palffy in front of the Lightning goal.
Palffy swung and missed because the puck hit Puppa's stick and
trickled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luc isn't always on the ice, but he has had a great start and
that has had an effect on everybody,'' general manager Dave Taylor
said. ``A couple of years ago, Luc was getting booed and he decided
to make a change. That is now the team's plan, too.''

JOSE Lima's personality hits you like one of his favorite baseball
pranks _ a smack in the face with a shaving-cream pie.
</P>
<P>
   Lima wiggles and gyrates. He talks loudly, makes bold
predictions, slide-steps and barks back at the opposing bench when
they start talking trash. Lima stares boldly at the camera with
those dancing, mischievous eyes of his and shouts his favorite
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Mike Hampton. The anti-Lima.
</P>
<P>
   While Lima wears his personality on his sleeve, Hampton tucks
his away in his shoe like a kid hiding lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   The mischief certainly is there, and you can count on it. But
usually it shows itself only when Hampton feels the need to break
the tension or set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   Before a recent big game, Astros closer Billy Wagner was talking
to the media and lamenting his recent lack of save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who drafts me in their fantasy baseball league is
stupid,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton walked by as Wagner spoke and without breaking a stride,
or a smile, quietly uttered, ``No kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lima can express an opinion or tell it like it is in
25,000 words or less, sometimes Hampton doesn't need any.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday in Atlanta after the Astros' 5-1 loss to the
Braves, someone pointed to a sportswriter who has a Cy Young Award
vote and told Hampton, ``He didn't vote for you. He voted for Randy
Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, straight-faced, said nothing, but as he walked away
mockingly acted as if he was pulling a knife out of his back.
</P>
<P>
   It also was Hampton who, at an exhibition game in San Antonio
last April, finally had had enough of San Antonio Missions mascot
``Henry the Puffy Taco'' running through the Astros' dugout. As the
mascot ran past the bench one too many times, Hampton exploded from
his seat and blindsided the mascot, taking the Taco to the ground
and making the Taco not just puffy but probably swollen, too.
</P>
<P>
   Before the mascot regained his senses enough to get up and see
who had smacked him, Hampton already was back on the bench _
straight-faced _ watching the game as if nothing had happened.
Teammates practically bit through their bottom lips, laughing,
trying not to identify the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the puffy tackle, Hampton responded through
that dead-serious stare of his: ``It wasn't me. It was a
conspiracy. Someone was wearing my jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton also coined the popular clubhouse phrase ``Killer
Fleas,'' after Bagwell and Craig Biggio struggled at the plate in
the Division Series against the Braves two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the most significant thing about that last quote:
Hampton got away with it. Anyone else, and the veterans might have
been agitated.
</P>
<P>
   But this team respects Hampton as much as any player in the
clubhouse. They know what he is.
</P>
<P>
   He is every bit the sly one, every bit the spirited one, but his
delivery is like his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Clever. Quiet. Devilish. It's what the Astros need now more than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is understatement to Lima's overstatement. He is the
well-placed one-liner to Lima's prop comedy.
</P>
<P>
   We mention all of this only because today at the Astrodome it
can only be called Hampton Time.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Astros have begun a typical postseason slide
with their one-hit loss that left this series tied at one game
apiece Wednesday, well be careful.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton knows the score. He figures to be the bulldog on the
mound, as always. He figures to be sly, quiet, clever. Nibble on
this corner. Toy with that corner. Throw a breaking ball when
they're expecting a fastball. Take the cutter outside when they're
expecting something inside.
</P>
<P>
   He figures to give the Astros what they need more than ever. If
there is one pitcher the Astros need as this Division Series is
perilously close to slipping away, it is Hampton. And there he will
be for the 3 p.m. start at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Lima often has called himself the ``stopper'' for this Astros
team _ the guy who turns around a bad trend. But really, while this
is not to cast any aspersions on Lima's superb season, the real
stopper for the Astros has been the real prankster.
</P>
<P>
   By having to start Hampton today because they needed him to
clinch the division title on the last day of the regular season,
it's as if the Astros have hidden their lunch money in their shoes.
They know where to find their meal ticket _ behind those
deceptively steely, serious eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton won a league-leading 22 games this season, but did you
know 10 of those victories came the day after an Astros loss?
</P>
<P>
   Looks can be deceiving. He is the sly, clever and cunning one on
the field and off. He is the Astros' stopper. And if Hampton cannot
turn this series back in their favor today, probably no one can.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Killer Fleas.

VICTIM`S MOTHER BANNED FROM MURDER TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The mother of murder victim Robert Adair was
barred from the San Fernando courthouse after an alleged
confrontation in a restroom with her former daughter-in-law, Jeanie
Adair, accused of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge L. Jeffery Wiatt ordered Margarita
Sutcliffe to stay at least 500 yards away from the courthouse while
Adair, who is free on $250,000 bail, is on trial.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Sutcliffe insisted she ``never said a thing''
in the restroom to the 39-year-old Adair, who is accused of killing
her husband with a baseball bat to collect insurance. Adair told
her attorney Thursday that Sutcliffe said, ``You're going to
burn.'' The lawyer alerted the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a liar,'' Sutcliffe said. ``All she did was walk in,
look at her hair and leave. I didn't say anything. Jeanie may
escape justice in court if they find her innocent, but she will not
escape God's justice. That's what I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Adair's attorney, Richard Plotin, declined to comment, as did
Adair.
</P>
<P>
   Adair's defense case began with Plotin's questioning Los Angeles
Police Department Detective Patricia Ferguson about why she did not
pursue a case against Mindy Shapiro. ``There was no reason ...
because Mindy was not involved in the murder of Robert Adair,''
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanie Adair claims Shapiro orchestrated an attack as an act of
revenge because she was having an affair with Shapiro's former
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Plotin also asked Ferguson why she did not pursue cases against
two convicted felons identified early as possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were extensive interviews, and our investigation
revealed they were not connected,'' Ferguson said. ``Even the
physical description Jeanie Adair gave of her attackers did not
fit. She described one suspect as having a belly. Neither of them
had bellies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by prosecutor Marsh Goldstein, Ferguson
discounted the theory that the two stole $250 from the Adair home,
killed Robert Adair and left Jeanie Adair alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They left Jeanie alive, an eyewitness, and that does not make
sense,'' Ferguson said, noting that one of the two would go to
prison for life under California's ``three strikes, you're out''
law if convicted of another ``strike.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the two also were at a pawn shop soon after the time of
the murder. She called it unlikely they would have been trying to
pawn a black-and-white television if they had just stolen $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the third striker would have immediately left the area
if he killed Robert, not go to a pawn shop. His actions just don't
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say Adair killed her 40-year-old husband in 1996 and
tried to cover it up by injuring herself and claiming a
home-invasion robbery occurred. Goldstein has told the jury that
Adair killed her husband to get $400,000 in life insurance and end
their troubled marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Plotin said Adair had no reason to covet her husband's
insurance because she was set to receive $275,000 settlement for an
on-the-job knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Plotin claimed LAPD detectives succumbed
to pressure from Sutcliffe and other relatives of Robert Adair to
arrest Jeanie Adair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They failed to thoroughly investigate the case. They didn't
even analyze the blood on Jeanie's clothing,'' Plotin said, noting
that recent test results revealed there wasn't a drop of her
husband's blood on her clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Adair could go to prison for life with no chance of parole if
she is convicted of murder with the special circumstances of lying
in wait and killing for financial gain.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to continue today with testimony from
another detective and cable company witnesses who reportedly heard
a struggle in Adair's condominium, located in suburban Sylmar.

   COLLEGES-ECONOMY (Cambridge, Mass.) _ The much-trumpeted
``knowledge'' (or information or innovation) economy consists of
much more than Silicon Valley. Across America, high-tech is
creating localized boomlets like the one here in Kendall Square,
which houses not only biotech but software and other companies. And
if there is one never-fail factor at work on these silicon corners,
it is the nearness of a research university shifting from ivory

   BUSH-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ For as long as Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas has been describing himself as a ``compassionate
conservative,'' Republicans and Democrats alike have wondered
whether the phrase was a call for a flexible new ideology or an
attempt to put a friendlier face on an essentially unchanged
philosophy. But as he starts to set out specific positions,
particularly on taxes and economic policy, Bush is by no means
abandoning the basic conservative principles that have defined the
party. He is clearly attempting a delicate balancing act. By

Revlon president, tell it, everything is going great at Revlon Inc.
But in the week since Revlon disclosed an inventory problem, its
stock has plunged 41 percent, to $10.75, even after bouncing back
$2 Thursday. The prices of Revlon junk bonds have also fallen
sharply. It is not easy to tell whether Fellow's optimism _ he
forecasts that the company will have positive operating cash flow
next year _ is justified. But it is clear that Revlon's near-term

``Beauty is how you see it'' to that list of pithy sayings. The

BRUINS FALTER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ The Bruins should send a big thank you note to
the Red Sox. After that, they should spend a few minutes dashing
off a note to the Patriots, expressing gratitude for that club's
4-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the Sox' shocking self-destruction in the
first two playoff games against Cleveland and the Patriots'
unblemished record, the spotlight would be shining brightly on the
Bruins' woeful 0-3-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins started well Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, but coughed up a 3-1
lead on the way to a 4-3 loss to the Ottawa Senators at the Corel
Centre. It is the team's worst start since the 1965-66 season, and
only the seventh time the Bruins have begun with three losses.
</P>
<P>
   The start has been particularly tough on goalie Rob Tallas, who
said Wednesday he would do everything within his power to stand on
his head. Unfortunately for him, he was left helpless too many
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a frustrating game,'' said Tallas (22 saves). ``We
were in it, but there wasn't any of that extra stuff you need to
win games. When we're up going into the third period, we need to
win. There's no doubt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have an opportunity to get the first win of the season and
get everybody excited, there was no excitement out there. I thought
I saw a lot of quick shots and I had to kick my legs out. That's
not our style of hockey. We were up, 3-1, and you've got to have
that hunger, to put a team down and keep putting them down. To let
them creep back in, it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I remember if we were up, they'd be lucky to see 10
shots for the rest of the game, we'd slow it right down. We didn't
do that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins came out red-hot in the opening 12 minutes, scoring
three goals, which is two more than they had in the season's first
120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Center Joe Thornton, who started out on the defensive line with
left wing P.J. Axelsson and right wing Rob DiMaio, made the most of
a DiMaio blast from the right side, chipping in the rebound at the
14-second mark. At 5:18, DiMaio and Thornton combined again, this
time with DiMaio beating Patrick Lalime for the 2-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, one of the league's best skating teams, closed to
2-1 during a power play when center Radek Bonk buried a rebound at
7:43.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took advantage of their own power play at 11:35 when
left wing Steve Heinze fed the puck from the slot over to big left
wing Dave Andreychuk, who put it home. After giving up three goals
on seven shots, Lalime was pulled at 11:35 by coach Jacques Martin.
In came Ron Tugnutt, one of the league's stingiest netminders last
season.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it fell apart for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alfredsson's goal at 16:23 of the first started the slide
as the Senators pulled to within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   After the scoreless second, the Senators took over. They tied
the game at 1:25 on a power-play goal by Alfredsson. At 11:30, the
penalty-prone Bruins again surrendered a power-play goal and that
was that.
</P>
<P>
   On the winner, Alfredsson picked Ray Bourque, preventing him
from reaching Marian Hossa. In turn, Hossa, one of the NHL's most
talented and exciting players, went flying behind the net and
buried a wraparound at the left post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get to (Hossa),'' said Bourque. ``Alfredsson
stepped right in front of me and kind of interfered and I couldn't
get to him. It allowed (Hossa) to get to the back of the net where
he came around and wrapped it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is the Bruins played much better than they had in
their first two games. But there were too many mistakes, too many
bad decisions, too many breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just made too many mistakes, that's all it is,'' said
Andreychuk.
</P>
<P>
   Through the disappointment, coach Pat Burns remained upbeat,
saying his club showed some grit and executed better at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are looking up,'' he said. ``There are still a lot of
guys who have to get settled in. There are a lot of new faces and
they have to learn.''

BOOMING RANGER BATS ARE SURPRISINGLY SILENT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ During the regular season, the Texas Rangers had a
.293 team batting average that led both leagues, their 945 runs
ranked second behind the Cleveland Indians, and they led both
leagues in hits, total bases and slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But in this American League division series with the Yankees,
they're the Texas Impostors. They're hitting .148.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees holding a 2-0 lead in the three-of-five game
series that resumes on Saturday night in Texas, the Rangers have
scored one run _ Juan Gonzalez's fourth-inning homer in Thursday
night's 3-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates, the Rangers' manager, shuffled his batting order,
moving shortstop Royce Clayton to leadoff and left fielder Rusty
Greer to the second spot ahead of catcher Ivan (Pudge) Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they,'' said Oates, alluding to Clayton and Greer,
``can get on base in front of Pudge and Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton and Greer not only never got on base, but didn't deliver
in the fifth with runners on third and second.
</P>
<P>
   With Roberto Kelly on third and Lee Stevens on second with none
out and the Rangers leading, 1-0, Mark McLemore worked the count to
three balls and no strikes, but then struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get it done,'' McLemore would say later. ``It was
key. It hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton bounced to Scott Brosius as Kelly stayed at third, then
Greer fanned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the game,'' Clayton said. ``On a 2-1 count, you think
you're in a good situation. I had laid off two faders away. I
thought the third pitch was low. The 2-1 pitch was a breaking ball,
and sometimes the bat head rolls over the top. I didn't get a good
enough pitch to hit to the other side or in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Every so often with microphones and notebooks in front of him,
Clayton would say, ``I'd give anything to get that at-bat back.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Greer, who had drawn two walks in Tuesday night's
opener but has yet to get a hit in this series in 6 official
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``On 3 and 2, he threw a pitch I wasn't expecting,'' Greer said,
alluding to Andy Pettitte, the Yankee left hander. ``I was
expecting something harder. I was way out in front of it and just
waved at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Oates talked about how he wanted the Rangers to
swing with what he called ``controlled aggressiveness,'' as opposed
to their ``passive patience'' Tuesday night in a two-hit, 8-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at tapes, we didn't have a whole lot of bat speed in
our swings,'' Oates said. ``We were too passive.''
</P>
<P>
   At least on Thursday night the Rangers had seven hits, including
two by Rafael Palmeiro, their designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a better chance of being successful swinging
the bats like we did in this game,'' Oates said. ``We had more
hits. I'm not sure we made more outs on pitches out of the strike
zone, but I know that we looked like we had a chance to do
something with the baseball.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When Houston football fans are distributing credit for helping our
city blow away Los Angeles for the 32nd franchise, they should not
overlook Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Dallas Cowboys' owner, is Houston's newest best
friend. He was instrumental in helping Houston get the expansion
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the song goes, ``All you Cowboys fans stand up and
cheer.'' This week, at least, we should all be Cowboys fans. And
that's blasphemy for some of us.
</P>
<P>
   Jones used his considerable influence and public-relations
skills to stump for Houston. His goal was to convince the owners
and NFL executives that he knew what was best financially for the
league in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Jones may be from Arkansas, but he had in mind what was best for
Texas as well as the NFL. Thankfully, 28 other owners lined up
behind him when it came to selecting Houston or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 11 years, the owners have learned enough about
Jones to know that when he preaches to them about money, they'd
better grab their wallets or call their investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones turned a $180 million investment in 1989 into the most
valuable franchise in professional sports. If he put the Cowboys
and Texas Stadium on the market, they might go for close to $1.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous, you say? In what some say is closer to a $900
million deal, Daniel Snyder bought the Redskins and Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium this year. He says he will put another $50 million into the
stadium, parking and roads.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the Cowboys and Texas Stadium were available. Just
think of the ego massage a multibillionaire could get by buying
them. Of course, Jones has no interest in selling. He's having way
too much fun, especially when he wins a long, difficult battle for
Houston, which he knew all along would be best for the league.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Jones was a tireless worker behind the scenes. There
were two things he wanted to achieve, and he's halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   Jones watched Houston win the 32nd franchise. Now, he wants to
help the Raiders return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes that if the Raiders move back to LA, it will end
lawsuits that could cost the league more than $1 billion. He
doesn't think the Bay Area needs two teams. And it would put a
franchise in the nation's second-largest city and television
market. But the Raiders issue is a long way from being solved.
</P>
<P>
   First, Jones had to help take care of Houston. He knew Houston's
plan was solid. He knew Houston was an NFL hotbed that was hungry
for another franchise to replace the Oilers. He understood that the
Oilers' move to Tennessee had nothing to do with fan support on
Sundays and everything to do with their feelings for owner Bud
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Jones studied Houston's stadium financial plan. He reminded
others that the $195 million in public money committed by Houston
and Harris County showed the strong commitment on the part of the
fans and politicians. He pointed out that Los Angeles had no public
money and probably wouldn't get any, no matter how long the league
waited.
</P>
<P>
   Jones became a Bob McNair fan. He knew McNair had the resources
and the drive to become ``one of the five best owners'' in the
league. Jones was looking for a new partner who had a vision like
his, a vision that would help the NFL become even more popular and
powerful worldwide and, ultimately, an even bigger money maker for
32 owners.
</P>
<P>
   Once Jones went public in August about the importance of the NFL
selecting Houston over Los Angeles, people began to take Houston
more seriously. Jones beat that drum so hard that many actually
began to change their opinion about the necessity of having Los
Angeles back in the league.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two months, Jones favored Houston so strongly that
he did everything but douse himself with gasoline and set himself
on fire to get attention so people would listen to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones told everyone who listened that Houston would get the
expansion team, and he was happy to explain why it should. He
always said having the expansion team in Houston was best for the
league. When he got around the owners, he rubbed elbows and twisted
arms. Fortunately, none broke.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they would still be playing in the NFC and AFC,
Jones wanted Dallas and Houston to play every year under a new
realignment and scheduling plan that is supposed to take care of
natural rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Jones knows that the Cowboys and Oilers set attendance records
in Tokyo, Mexico City and El Paso. And those were preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the expansion process, Jones' critics predicted there
was no way he would be in Houston's corner. They said when Jones
looked at our vacant market, he saw Silver and Blue. He may have,
but when he wanted to see more green, he knew Houston needed
another team.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Cowboys are already America's team. And Japan's
team. And Mexico's team. And Texas' team, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jones knew that Texas needed another team, and he saw the
endless marketing possibilities with a successful franchise
operated by a popular owner with deep pockets. In Jones' mind,
McNair was ideal.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Jones was quietly working to help return the
Raiders to Los Angeles. Talk about a hard sell. When owner Al Davis
bolted Los Angeles for Oakland, he left behind a lot of bad
feelings on the part of fans, media, politicians and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced Houston as the 32nd
franchise, he said he didn't believe another team would move for a
while. Jones said just the opposite. He said the Houston decision
cleared the way for Los Angeles to get an existing team.
</P>
<P>
   And sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is getting Los Angeles to let bygones be bygones
with Davis, who had a deal for a new stadium at Hollywood Park. His
lawsuit claims the NFL interfered with his deal at Hollywood Park
and cost him millions, perhaps billions. League sources say there's
a good chance he might win the suit.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones needs help, McNair should volunteer. That's the least
he can do. After all, Davis refused to abstain when the Houston
vote was taken. Davis voted yes. And Davis would rather wear a
turquoise Raiders jump suit than do anything but abstain in voting
on most league issues. Even if that issue was in his best
interests.

<P>
   People who constantly remind themselves to make a phone call or
invite someone to dinner are more likely to forget what they wanted
to say or buy all the right food than those who take a more relaxed
approach to everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   New research has shown that trying to remember facts or tasks by
saying them over and over again blocks related memories and induces
forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show that students who cram for exams or ask
colleagues to quiz them before the start will forget vital
information for the duration of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Macrae, professor of experimental psychology at Britain's
Bristol University and author of the report, said: ``In anxious
situations, such as exams, people employ a range of methods to help
them remember. However, although the logic of repeating facts over
and over again may seem flawless, this attempt at cramming
information into your brain blocks other information temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   For memory to function effectively, the mind has to be able to
deal with competing related information.
</P>
<P>
   The research, in the latest issue of the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology, involved 128 students.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment they sat through a mock geography exam. They
were presented with 20 facts about two fictitious islands. The
group was divided into two, with one half receiving ``cramming''
cards to remind them about half of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the whole group was tested, those who had crammed could
recall more of the latest data given to them, but performed four
times as badly on recalling all 20 facts.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists believe these findings have important implications
for people trying to forget traumatic memories.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Macrae said: ``The victim of abuse will hold both
negative and positive memories of the perpetrator. It is likely
that the victim will be motivated only to retrieve the good
memories not caring to dwell on material that is disturbing.
Constant retrieval can serve a valuable function of locking
unwanted recollections in memory.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The inmates of San Francisco's county jail have
seen plenty in their time, but this was a new one even for them.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the sheriff's department thoughtfully organized a
seminar to teach them about their civil rights. Even more
thoughtfully, the lawyer running the class decided to teach them
how to run rings around the police, how to wriggle their way out of
search warrants, and even how to pick the right store to rob
without encountering excessive security.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies looked on in stunned amazement as role
players in police uniforms depicted themselves as slow-witted,
racist thugs, and the instructor, civil-rights lawyer Katya
Komisaruk, taught her 120 charges how to see through the trickery
of good cop-bad cop interrogation routines.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of deputies raising hell, the course has now
been hurriedly dropped _ much to the embarrassment of the city
authorities and the amusement of just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better way to reduce the city's jail population than
teaching the criminals how not to get caught?'' David Hardy,
president of the San Francisco Deputy Sheriffs' Association, asked
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe that the tax-paying citizen could support the
sheriff teaching people how to be better criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Komisaruk, a radical with a hell-raising past of her own _ she
served time in federal prison for smashing computers at the
Vandenburg military base in California during an anti-nuclear
protest nine years ago _ insisted that everything she had said was
legally accurate. The actors dressed up as policemen were meant to
be entertaining, not demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be some disagreement, however, whether her tips
constituted civil-rights education or merely instruction on how to
avoid getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did she address the finer points of search warrants and
the right to request the presence of a lawyer before agreeing to
police questioning, she also came out with lines like: ``It's
stupid to boost from the large chain stores. They have better
security.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has been running civil-rights courses for
prisoners _ unheard of in the rest of the United States _ for more
than 20 years, thanks to the liberal credentials of the city's
sheriff, Mike Hennessey, a former prisoners' rights activist and
diehard Sex Pistols fan.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department said the classes would be resuming, but
with another instructor. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ If you are planning to send your children to
school in San Jose, Calif., over the next 10 years, you had better
make sure they like Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The school district there has recently signed a deal making the
Pepsi-Cola company the exclusive fizzy drink vendor for its
schools. The deal is worth $3.5 million to the district, and even
more if the kids drink up.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, if a child is 11 or 12, the chances are he
or she will be using a textbook called ``Mathematics: Applications
and Connections'' that teaches fractions by counting the sweets
M&AMP;Ms, and asks how many hours a teenager would have to work at
McDonald's to pay for a new pair of Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by McGraw Hill, is used in 50 states and is
officially endorsed by 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even more widespread is an in-school television station, Channel
One, which is watched by eight million United States schoolchildren
daily. The station provides 10 minutes of programming, including
two minutes of compulsory advertising, as the price for free
television and video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Its computer equivalent, a company called ZapMe!, provides free
hardware but obliges schools to use its machines for four hours
each day and expose children to advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in U.S. schools is reaching epidemic proportions.
Some 150 schools and school districts have exclusive drinks
contracts in what is rapidly turning into a turf war between Pepsi
and Coca-Cola, neither of them noted for the nutritional or health
values of their products.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgia teenager who wore a Pepsi shirt to his school's Coke
Day last year was suspended for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against this trend is beginning to take shape,
however. The state of California has just passed a law banning
product placement in school textbooks _ dealing a severe blow to
the fortunes of the McGraw Hill math book, since California is the
single largest education market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which bans exclusive Coca-Cola contracts, is
considering a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic (about the California textbook ban) because
it's an important precedent. It was a trend that was just
starting,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw of the Center for Commercial-Free
Public Education, a national nonprofit campaign group. ``If not
checked, it would have expanded to other companies and other
books.''
</P>
<P>
   But a second bill introduced in California recently, which would
have banned classroom television and most other forms of
advertising in schools, ran into a wall of resistance after Channel
One hired a powerful lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now sitting on the desk of California Governor Gray
Davis for consideration is heavily watered down, merely mandating
public hearings before schools can buy Channel One's services.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagelshaw, school districts rarely make their
negotiations with private companies known to parents and teachers.
San Jose had been talking to Pepsi for a year, but local papers
only reported it days before the signing.
</P>
<P>
   His group argues the deals are detrimental to schools even in
financial terms, because taxpayers still pay for the time in which
students are being bombarded by private advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers recently calculated that Channel One costs
U.S. taxpayers $1.8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things are taking advantage of a captive audience.
That's why companies want to get into schools,'' Hagelshaw said.
``But is it ethical for community leaders to buy and sell our
students' attention? Are we going to treat our students as
commodities we can barter in exchange for resources, or treat them
as precious resources themselves?'' &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ If you are planning to send your children to
school in San Jose, Calif., over the next 10 years, you had better
make sure they like Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   The school district there has recently signed a deal making the
Pepsi-Cola company the exclusive fizzy drink vendor for its
schools. The deal is worth $3.5 million to the district, and even
more if the kids drink up.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, if a child is 11 or 12, the chances are he
or she will be using a textbook called ``Mathematics: Applications
and Connections'' that teaches fractions by counting the sweets
M&AMP;Ms, and asks how many hours a teenager would have to work at
McDonald's to pay for a new pair of Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by McGraw Hill, is used in 50 states and is
officially endorsed by 15 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even more widespread is an in-school television station, Channel
One, which is watched by eight million United States schoolchildren
daily. The station provides 10 minutes of programming, including
two minutes of compulsory advertising, as the price for free
television and video equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Its computer equivalent, a company called ZapMe!, provides free
hardware but obliges schools to use its machines for four hours
each day and expose children to advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising in U.S. schools is reaching epidemic proportions.
Some 150 schools and school districts have exclusive drinks
contracts in what is rapidly turning into a turf war between Pepsi
and Coca-Cola, neither of them noted for the nutritional or health
values of their products.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgia teenager who wore a Pepsi shirt to his school's Coke
Day last year was suspended for insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against this trend is beginning to take shape,
however. The state of California has just passed a law banning
product placement in school textbooks _ dealing a severe blow to
the fortunes of the McGraw Hill math book, since California is the
single largest education market in the country.
</P>
<P>
   New York, which bans exclusive Coca-Cola contracts, is
considering a similar measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ecstatic (about the California textbook ban) because
it's an important precedent. It was a trend that was just
starting,'' said Andrew Hagelshaw of the Center for Commercial-Free
Public Education, a national nonprofit campaign group. ``If not
checked, it would have expanded to other companies and other
books.''
</P>
<P>
   But a second bill introduced in California recently, which would
have banned classroom television and most other forms of
advertising in schools, ran into a wall of resistance after Channel
One hired a powerful lobbying firm.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now sitting on the desk of California Governor Gray
Davis for consideration is heavily watered down, merely mandating
public hearings before schools can buy Channel One's services.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagelshaw, school districts rarely make their
negotiations with private companies known to parents and teachers.
San Jose had been talking to Pepsi for a year, but local papers
only reported it days before the signing.
</P>
<P>
   His group argues the deals are detrimental to schools even in
financial terms, because taxpayers still pay for the time in which
students are being bombarded by private advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers recently calculated that Channel One costs
U.S. taxpayers $1.8 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things are taking advantage of a captive audience.
That's why companies want to get into schools,'' Hagelshaw said.
``But is it ethical for community leaders to buy and sell our
students' attention? Are we going to treat our students as
commodities we can barter in exchange for resources, or treat them
as precious resources themselves?'' &QL;

<P>
   After 52 years, India has at last found a leader it likes who is
not a member of Jawaharlal Nehru's family.
</P>
<P>
   Atal Behari Vajpayee, who is likely to start his third term as
Prime Minister in the next few days, is an amateur poet, a Hindu
romantic, a parliamentarian for more than 40 years, a lyrical
orator, a Brahmin and an honest man.
</P>
<P>
   He is, his opponents allege, ``a good man in the wrong party'';
a ``mask'' for the fanatics and fascists who make themselves amply
at home in the Hindu nationalist family.
</P>
<P>
   To his party before the last election one and a half years ago
he was ``the man India awaits.''
</P>
<P>
   Against great odds, Vajpayee has justified the trust his party
has placed in him, though as much by luck as good judgment.
</P>
<P>
   He began his term last year in dramatic fashion by staging five
nuclear tests and drawing down the wrath of the world. Delhi's
diplomatic grapevine has been humming with speculation that they
might do some more tests on winning this election.
</P>
<P>
   By the time his parliament was defeated in parliament in April,
thanks to the defection of an ally, he looked like a blundering old
man _ he is 74 _ and way out of his depth.
</P>
<P>
   He could make India a nuclear power, but could not control the
price of onions _ let alone his coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   When he had been relegated to the status of ``caretaker prime
minister'' Vajpayee got lucky. His luck took an unlikely form.
Pakistani troops infiltrated deep into Indian territory above
Kargil in Kashmir, and seized strategic positions high in the
mountains. By the time they were discovered in early May they were
practically unassailable.
</P>
<P>
   That was a great embarrassment for India, but Vajpayee turned
this debacle into a diplomatic and military triumph. The
infiltrators were met by massive Indian force, but the government
resisted powerful military persuasion to end the conflict quickly
by crossing the cease-fire line, the so-called Line of Control.
</P>
<P>
   This restraint won international applause, and was followed by a
massive diplomatic effort to persuade world leaders that Pakistan
was the aggressor, which left Pakistan isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Reckless enough to try to bomb his way to the top table; but
calm under heavy pressure: that is the paradoxical impression
Vajpayee made.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been something Churchillian about him. The Kargil
crisis reinforced the image of a bulldog brahmin. His popularity
now transcends party and regional lines. &QL;

   AMMAN, JORDAN _ He is glossy, affable, short _ the unkind would
say squat _ and has the sort of heavy facial features that hint at
a prize fighter. And now, eight months after assuming the throne of
the Hashemite kingdom, King Abdullah II of Jordan has thrown his
first big punch.
</P>
<P>
   The target of the youthful new king's uppercut is Hamas, the
militant Islamic group which has long been active among Jordan's
Palestinian population, and which is now reeling after the
detention of 21 members. Among them are two of the organization's
senior figures.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old king, who took over the throne after the death
from cancer of his father, King Hussein, spelled out his strategy
in a conversation with a small group of correspondents Wednesday,
before he set off for a trip to the United States where he will
meet Bill Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jordan has made itself clear that Hamas offices will be shut
down in Jordan and that is what will happen,'' he said, over brunch
in palace offices in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandhurst (English military academy)-educated king, who
formerly commanded the Jordanian army's Special Operations, appears
to enjoy using the logic of a military man: ``A soldier has to pick
his battles, rather than let other people chose them for him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two prominent Hamas leaders are now behind bars _
Khalid Mashaal, head of its ``politburo,'' and Ibrahim Ghosheh, a
senior publicity official.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the men, both Jordanian citizens, were taken into
custody as they arrived in Jordan from a trip to Iran, along with
their four bodyguards. At the time, Jordanian officials said the
two had been gathering security-related information on Jordan,
training militant cadres, and stockpiling caches of arms. The two
Hamas men denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed a swoop in late August when Jordanian
police also raided Hamas offices, closing them down and detaining
15 staff. Since then public figures have been warned against
advocating pro-Hamas views, and a Muslim cleric, who made pro-Hamas
sermons was arrested and held for six days..
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's crackdown has fuelled speculation that the new king is
not so much flexing his own muscles as acting on the behest of the
Israelis or the United States, both of whom relish the spectacle of
militant Palestinians being sent packing from Amman (almost
certainly to Syria).
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is fair or not, the purge suggests that the king _
who, in the past, has openly criticized the U.S. enemy-in-chief,
Iran _ leans more unambiguously towards Washington than his
brilliantly pragmatic father, King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The latter _ whose grizzled, twinkling features still adorn
banners and posters throughout his desert kingdom, and whose name
is repeatedly summoned up by his devoted heir _ was also
pro-western. But powerful elements of the Arab world have yet to
forget how King Hussein adopted what they saw as an excessively
pro-Iraqi stance in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the new king has some cause to please the Americans,
who have been increasing their already substantial aid to Jordan,
and are next year expected to pay out $125 million in military aid
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But the crackdown on Hamas also benefits Yasser Arafat, who
views it as a thorn in the side which threatens to disrupt the
already precarious Middle East peace process. The Palestinian
leader has been privately pressuring the Jordanians to act.
</P>
<P>
   The king's tactics entail significant risks. Although Hamas does
not enjoy strong public support in Jordan, surveys suggest that
many of the population share its opposition to making a peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a chance that the jailed Hamas leaders will seize
on the possibility of a trial to publicize their cause _ a risk
which suggests Jordan's best ploy would be to strike a deal in
which they are released and exiled.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is part of a larger bid by Jordan's leader to breathe
air into the cinders of the Oslo peace process, which fizzled
during the stagnant rule of Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu but is now
showing signs of new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is a great sense of euphoria in the Middle East,''
King Abdullah said Wednesday, ``My greatest fear is what happens if
nothing takes place over the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is unlikely to do much to endear the new king _
who speaks limited Arabic but is as slick and as persuasive in
English as an international financier _ to much of his country,
burdened as it is by high unemployment, sparse natural resources,
and a hefty foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   But it will strengthen his claim on his father's other title;
that of ``plucky little king.'' &QL;

on the possibility of a trial to publicize their cause _ a risk
which suggests Jordan's best ploy would be to strike a deal in
which they are released and exiled.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is part of a larger bid by Jordan's leader to breathe
air into the cinders of the Oslo peace process, which fizzled
during the stagnant rule of Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu but is now
showing signs of new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is a great sense of euphoria in the Middle East,''
King Abdullah said Wednesday, ``My greatest fear is what happens if
nothing takes place over the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach is unlikely to do much to endear the new king _
who speaks limited Arabic but is as slick and as persuasive in
English as an international financier _ to much of his country,
burdened as it is by high unemployment, sparse natural resources,
and a hefty foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   But it will strengthen his claim on his father's other title;
that of ``plucky little king.'' &QL;

 &HT;    House HMO reform bill is triumph for Norwood
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved a massive overhaul of the
managed health care industry Thursday that gives patients broad
rights to sue their health insurer for denying care and to choose
their own doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was a significant political victory for Rep.
Charlie Norwood (R-Ga). As the bill's chief architect, he handily
de- feated the wishes of his own party's top leaders, who favored a
far more limited legal recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now on top of Hamburger Hill,'' said an ebullient
Norwood immediately after the 275-151 vote. He was referring to a
Vietnam War battle in which U.S. troops withstood 11 bloody
assaults before prevailing.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood's bill, co-authored by Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), won
the support of 67 Republicans and 206 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Georgia delegation, Norwood was joined by Republicans
Bob Barr and Saxby Chambliss and Democrats Sanford Bishop, John
Lewis and Cynthia McKin- ney. ``The final victory was larger than
anyone predicted,'' said Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), an early backer
of the Norwood-Dingell plan. ``The employers may not like it, but
the employees will love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote drew an intensive lobbying campaign, with President
Clinton personally calling lawmakers from Air Force One and
Republican leaders making their own rounds in an effort to avoid an
embarrassing defeat for House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.).
</P>
<P>
   ``The passage of this bill represents a major victory for every
family and every health plan,'' Clinton said. ``It shows that
America is no longer willing to allow unfeeling practices of some
health plans to add to the pain of injury or disease. It proves
that America is committed to putting patients first.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in New York, Clinton said he was pleased the House had
rejected a ``watered-down'' measure put forth by Republicans Tom
Coburn of Oklahoma and John Shadegg of Arizona. That bill, which
had the blessing of Hastert and other Republican leaders, went down
238-193.
</P>
<P>
   Georgians voting for the defeated GOP alternative were Chambliss
and fellow Republicans Mac Collins, Nathan Deal, Johnny Isakson,
Jack Kingston and John Linder.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwood-Dingell bill allows patients to sue for damages if a
health insurance company denies or delays care at any point.
Patients can also seek remedy from an external review panel.
</P>
<P>
   The defeated Coburn-Shadegg bill would have required patients to
exhaust all administrative appeals before taking a managed health
care company to court. And then lawsuits would have been restricted
to federal courts, where monetary damages are usually lower, unless
the patient lived in a state where such lawsuits are permitted.
</P>
<P>
   As well as giving patients the right to choose a doctor, the
Norwood-Dingell bill would allow women to seek care from
obstetricians and gynecologists and children to see a pediatrician
without going first to a primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance plans would be required to pay for emergency
room care, and doctors would be allowed to talk to patients without
worrying about violating managed care rules.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was passionate and fiery. Democrats portrayed
Republicans as protectors of the health insurance industry;
Republicans painted Democrats as protectors of the trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the final vote, Rep. Greg Ganske (R-Iowa) wheeled
7-year-old James Adams of Atlanta to the floor of the House to show
what can happen under a managed care company's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Adams lost his forearms and legs to gangrene after his insurance
company ordered his parents to take him to a hospital about 60
miles away for treatment of a 104-degree fever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had a finger and you pricked it, it would bleed. He's
not an anecdote,'' said Ganske, as Adams sat playing in the front
row of the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The right to sue was at the heart of arguments on both sides. A
1974 federal law intended to protect employee health and pension
plans had the unintended effect of granting liability protection to
managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert and other Republican leaders said their plan would keep
frivolous lawsuits to a minimum. Norwood and Dingell ar- gued it
created so many obstacles that the patient might be dead by the
time they finished appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert even went to the floor to appeal to lawmakers. ``We've
got a solid, balanced approach that I urge you to support,'' the
speaker said. ``The difference in these bills is how far you go,
how far you give license to the trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats argued that the GOP plan did not go far enough.
``It fails to hold health care providers accountable. It lets them
off the hook,'' said Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.).
</P>
<P>
   When his son had terminal cancer in 1972, Gephardt said, he was
fortunate to have insurance that allowed him to go to a specialist
who could find a special treatment. Under today's health care
system, his son would be denied that opportunity, Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the final vote, Norwood made a final, emotional
plea: ``I did everything I could do to get the Republicans to take
this issue. I realized for us to change the law in this country, we
have to do it in a bipartisan

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Two fates are sealed by a slap in
the face
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches From Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, at
least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   (A photo of Bronzie and Clyde R. Ray taken 20 years ago is
available by calling CoxNet at 404-526-5456.)
</P>
<P>
   By Clyde R. Ray
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It was a beautiful balmy Sunday afternoon in June
1935 when I first met Bronzie Lee Harris.
</P>
<P>
   For about a year before that, a friend of mine who dated
Bronzie's sister had been trying to ``fix us up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I didn't tell this to my friend, I was reluctant to
date Bronzie because I thought she was a redhead like me, having
decided that Bronzie was a nickname for a red-haired girl.
</P>
<P>
   Boy, was I in for a shock.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that fateful afternoon when a group of us boys drove
out to Fowler's Lake, a favorite swimming hole for our younger set.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, Bronzie and some of her girlfriends had the same
idea. So, finally, I was introduced to Bronzie, and I mentally
castigated myself for my previous stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   To grossly understate the case, Bronzie was a living doll. Her
hair was a satiny, coal-black halo framing a face so beautiful that
she could well have been the model for Leonardo da Vinci's ``Mona
Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   As you may judge, I was badly smitten, a true case of love at
first sight.
</P>
<P>
   I went to church with her that night. After church, several boys
and girls got together at a friend's home. We had homemade freezer
ice cream and cake. Then we gathered around the piano and joyously
sang Christian and love songs.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing next to Bronzie. The magic of her ethereal beauty
suddenly overcame me. Impulsively, I reached out, put my arms
around her and kissed her full on the lips.
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction was quick and meaningful. She sharply slapped my
face.
</P>
<P>
   I apologized but told her that she was so attractive and
irresistible that I simply couldn't help myself.
</P>
<P>
   Bronzie accepted my apology and during the course of the evening
implied in so many words that I might call on her. I respected her
so much for that slap that from then on she was the only girl for
me.
</P>
<P>
   We had a wonderful year of courtship, and it's been the same
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26, 1999, we celebrated our 63rd wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Bronzie had one of the finest careers in our society: That of
housewife and mother of our two children.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Bronzie, for the more than 60,000 meals you've
cooked, besides all those good cakes, and for the washing and
ironing you've slaved over for more than six decades.
</P>
<P>
   That trip to Fowler's Lake in June 1935 turned out to be the
most important journey of my life.
</P>

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Printing the good news
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The good news came the other day in the form of a phone call. My
second grandchild will be a little girl. And, thanks to the
miracles of modern medicine, there she was on videotape, unnamed
and a bit more than a tadpole, swimming around in her mother's
belly. Perfectly formed, notably active, said the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Mira, my 3-year-old granddaughter, was wonderfully happy. She
has been lobbying, vociferously, for a baby sister. Mira has been
learning the facts _ well, a fact or two _ of life. She has been
hugging and kissing her mommy's somewhat pregnant belly.
</P>
<P>
   I had a talk with Mira a few days before the arrival of the good
news. Do you want a baby brother or a baby sister? I asked, the way
adults do in their most boring manifestations. Baby sister, she
said. You know, Mira, I said, hoping to drop in a bit of education,
it could be a baby brother, and that would be just as good. She
looked at me peculiarly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What're you worried about?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   You can't even patronize a 3-year-old these days.

 &HT;    Tulsa's middle name is 'oil'
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ From not long after oil was struck here in 1901
through the first half of the century, Tulsa was the center of one
of the world's leading oilproducing regions. The city soon became
known as the ``Oil Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Although oil production in Oklahoma has slowed and the industry
is just now recovering from its collapse in 1985 _ when the price
of a barrel plummeted from $25 to $9 in a single day _ Tulsa still
considers itself the world's oil capital. To find out why, all you
have to do is pick up the Greater Tulsa phone book _ specifically,
the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   They're like Yellow Pages everywhere until you get to the letter
``O.'' Then, right after Office Supplies, the listings of
oil-related businesses begin _ hundreds of them.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 154 businesses are engaged in Oil &AMP; Gas
Exploration and Development. After that, the oil business gets
pretty compartmentalized.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to meet Tulsans' oil drilling-related needs are businesses
in the straightforward category of Oil Welling Drilling (nine) and
such specialties as Oil Well Directional Drilling (one), Oil Well
Casing Pulling (one) and Oil Well Drilling Mud &AMP; Additives (eight).
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of equipment, there are companies in categories for
Oil Field Equipment (66), Oil Field Pumping Equipment (four), Oil
Well Logging &AMP; Perforating Equipment (one) and, for roustabouts who
can't make a commitment, Oil Field Equipment Rentals (two).
</P>
<P>
   There are even three companies that provide Oil Well Fishing
Tools. That's for when your drill bit falls off and you have to
fish it out of the well bore.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever been to Oklahoma, you've seen lonely oil rigs out
on the plain pumping away without apparent human intervention.
Looks easy, right? Get yourself a lease, drill a well, and stuff
your savings account at the Oil Capital Federal Credit Union with
royalty checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Tulsa Yellow Pages indicates it's not so simple. If
oil wells were low maintenance, would there be 67 businesses under
the category of Oil Field Services?
</P>
<P>
   Their names suggest some of the services needed in the oil
fields: American Tank Cleaning Co., Protective Coating and
Sandblasting Co., Cherokee Hose &AMP; Supply, Hudgins Co. Pipe Testing.
Some of the suggestions are a bitoblique: J B Hot Oil &AMP; Steam Co.,
Blue Star Acid Service, International Blenders Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The names of tank-truck companies indicate they're often needed
urgently; if Quickdraw Tank Truck Service can't get there fast
enough, try Lightning Tank Trucks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to drill in the Tulsa area, expect lots of
competition _ the Yellow Pages lists 71 Oil Producers. Luckily, 27
Oil Marketers are there to sell the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a disaster, call one of the two businesses
listed under Oil Spill Clean-Up &AMP; Control.
</P>
<P>
   When your well runs dry, don't leave the well bore open; a child
could fall in. Call the oil-well undertaker listed under Oil Well
Cementing to eliminate the safety hazard.

 &HT;    We may be paying for our neglect of the arts in school
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I don't remember much about prayer in school,
though I can remember being the student selected to read the prayer
over the loud speaker more than a few times.
</P>
<P>
   I think school administrators kept picking me because they hoped
that the message would eventually sink in. Those of us who acted
most like heathens got selected the most.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the word ``amen'' I don't remember a single word of a
single prayer ever uttered in school and I am not among those who
believes that it is of much worth to read a prayer over the
intercom.
</P>
<P>
   I think prayer _ one student to one God _ is of great worth, of
course, and that can be done anytime, anywhere without anyone ever
knowing.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't really buy it when people say that the problems with
school violence stem from taking God out of school. Indeed, God is
much more a part of school today than it ever was when I was a
student.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my high school days, the few students who would have
admitted to being religious were called ``Jesus freaks'' and were
mostly derided by other students. Unlike Marshall High School, you
never would have had enough people to encircle a flagpole before
school to pray.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike the days when God's part in school was mostly rote,
these students have real feelings and beliefs and they let them
show.
</P>
<P>
   God out of school? That's nonsense. Those who say that haven't
been around schools lately.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other things we've taken out of schools in the
last two decades that haven't had such a revival.
</P>
<P>
   The arts, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   It may strike some of you as implausible that taking the arts
out of school could lead to problems down the line, but it seems a
real possibility to me.
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare said ``Music hath charms to soothe the
savage breast,'' and he was right. A pet peeve of mine is when
people _ who obviously have missed instruction in the arts _ change
the last word of that line from ``breast'' to ``beast.''
Shakespeare wasn't talking about calming dogs and cats, he was
talking about humans.
</P>
<P>
   The arts isn't completely out of school and local schools have
some fine arts instructors, but society _ this is happening
everywhere _ has slashed the arts to save money and to meet that
goal of ``getting back to the basics.'' Kids do have to learn to
read, write and do math, but, beyond that, little is more basic
than the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that most people over 40 remember sitting in
art class every day going over little postcard-sized pictures of
the great works of art. This was real school work. In a test, you
had the picture and you had to give its correct title and tell who
created it. Likewise, you had to listen to a work of music and do
the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a sixth-grader, I could identify ``The Last Supper,'' or
``An American Gothic.'' I knew that it was really the ``William
Tell Overture,'' and not the theme from ``The Lone Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a deep knowledge of the arts, mind you, but it is
much deeper than we are allowing schools to teach today.
</P>
<P>
   I asked each of my children to describe ``An American Gothic''
for me, perhaps the most recognizable piece of American art ever.
None of them could do it, including the two who have been enrolled
in gifted and talented programs for years.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest son, bless him, first said American Gothics were
people who wore black leather jackets. At least when I described
the painting to him, he knew what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   As with all kinds of education, arts instruction can and should
be done in the home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it strikes me as amazing that we would be willing to pay
for classes pleading with teens not to have sex _ something that
darn sure ought to be done in the home _ while cutting arts
funding.
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know if spending more time on the arts would have
prevented some of the tragedies that we've already faced, but it is
never too late to work to prevent the next one.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we are casting about for ideas, why not try one that
doesn't involve skirting around the First or Second Amendments? An
idea doesn't have to be controversial to work.

 &HT;    Ventura's controversial interview nevertheless honest
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ American voters are like the lass who will not
share her favors until a suitor professes his love, whether he
means it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura is not about to
breathe sweet nothings into the ear of the electorate to court
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura stirred up a hornet's nest with his interview in Playboy
magazine in which he offered candid opinions on a variety of
hot-button subjects.
</P>
<P>
   His answers and observations offended many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But did Ventura lie?
</P>
<P>
   Did Ventura equivocate?
</P>
<P>
   Did he parse his words?
</P>
<P>
   Did he redefine words?
</P>
<P>
   Did he later say he was misquoted?
</P>
<P>
   Did he claim his comments were taken out of context?
</P>
<P>
   Did he blame the press?
</P>
<P>
   Did he change the subject by claiming a vast conspiracy was out
to get him?
</P>
<P>
   Did he try to excuse his behavior by pointing out that other
politicians in the past also have made inflammatory remarks?
</P>
<P>
   Did he duck any of the questions he was asked?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all those questions is no, no, no and a thousand
times no.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, people are saying that Ventura is a lousy
politician.
</P>
<P>
   The former professional wrestler has a lot to learn about
politics if he hopes to get elected again, say political pundits.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes to be a political pundit is the willingness to
admit your inability to perform useful labor. The qualifications
are similar to those of an artist.
</P>
<P>
   As an admitted political pundit, I agree with my fellow pundits.
Ventura has a lot to learn about politics _ at least the way
politics have evolved in America.
</P>
<P>
   Today's traditional politicians go out of their way to insert
religious piety into their political campaigns. They talk about
their private religious beliefs and conversions. They do their best
to show the religious trappings of America's main religious
dominations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are true to their own pious murmurings in word and
deed is an open question. At least they are playing the political
game as voters have come to expect it to be played.
</P>
<P>
   When Ventura called organized religion ``a sham and a crutch for
weak-minded people who need strength in numbers,'' he definitely
went outside traditional American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's concern with organized religion as practiced in the
United States is that it ``tells people to go out and stick their
noses in other people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's concern with organized religion gaining the political
clout needed to get laws passed to restrict individual behavior is
in keeping with his belief that individual Americans should have
sole dominion over their own lives so long as they do not forcibly
interfere with the equal right of others to live as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   This is a view held by the Libertarian Party even though Ventura
is a member of Ross Perot's Reform Party, which is nothing if not a
refuge for nontraditional political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's views on decriminalizing drugs and prostitution are
consistent with his other nontraditional positions.
</P>
<P>
   When asked his opinion of the Navy Tailhook scandal, Ventura's
response infuriated many Americans even though he said he did not
condone the behavior of the aviators and that the guilty gropers
deserved to be court-martialed.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is an off-the-wall politician. He tells you what's on
his mind, take it or leave it. I'll take the honesty part.

 &HT;    Today's journalism suffering from colorblindness
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ One thing I learned when I was hired as
editor of a daily newspaper is that you can't be conservative
enough for conservatives or liberal enough for liberals. Certainly
a native Southerner working for a Southern newspaper can't be
liberal enough to suit journalists from other parts of the country
who equate anything below the Mason-Dixon line with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   I had to admit a bit of perverse pleasure when I heard from Bob
Christian, my personal Washington correspondent. Bob is a native of
Tate, Ga., who worked his way from The Atlanta Journal sports
department through high office with Delta and Eastern airlines to
retirement in northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   He sent clippings of a headline and story from the Washington
Post along with the comment that they had caused a big controversy,
prompting a flood of telephone calls, e-mail, and letters to the
Post. Accused of racism, the Post naturally was quick to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   The story began this way:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE, Sept. 14 _ Martin O'Mallory, a white City Council
member, won the Democratic mayoral nomination today in this
black-majority city. His biggest challenge came from two black
candidates, but he easily outdistanced them.'' The story quickly
explained that a Democratic nomination is tantamount to election in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The offending headline said: ``White man gets mayoral nomination
in Baltimore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are taught to cover the ``W's'' in the first
paragraph: Tell who, what, when, where and then get to the why.
Headlines capsule what a story is about. I think my old journalism
professor, Tyus Butler, would give an ``A'' to the Post reporter
who wrote the story and to the copy editor who wrote the headline.
Although we might wish otherwise, race certainly is a part of 1990s
politics. A white mayor following a black mayor in a two-thirds
black city is news.
</P>
<P>
   The Post would now have us believe the candidate's skin color
was no more significant than the fact he plays guitar in a Celtic
band. Somewhere along the way, media folk came up with the foolish
idea of colorblindness, although I keep reading about how white
mayors are succeeding black mayors in New York and Los Angeles, and
are not likely to in Atlanta. Getting color out of today's news is
like pumping water out of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Being colorblind isn't always enough. Cliff Baldowski was about
as close to colorblind as anyone I've known, and it got him in
trouble. Sitting in his church on Cascade Road in South Atlanta,
surrounded by colors quite different from Buckhead, and listening
to the eulogies, I thought about that, and how his bosses at the
newspaper let him down in the twilight of his brilliant career.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years at The Atlanta Constitution, he worked in
harness with Ralph McGill at a time when, as Hal Gulliver reminds
us, ``it took guts to have guts.'' Many a day McGill and Baldy had
to breach a line of Ku Kluxers when they went to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   His cartoons had at least as much impact on Georgia and the
South as the words of prize-winning columnists. He missed some of
the glory that came to others because he was an humble man who
often passed up national subjects to do his skewerings of local
crooks, fat cats, fools and pompous jerks. His hilarious treatment
of ``The Shag Cates Gang'' and their Fulton County courthouse
shenanigans deserved a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Editorial cartoonists exaggerate features of people they draw.
FDR was characterized by his chin and cigarette holder, Jimmy
Carter by his teeth, Richard Nixon by his nose. Baldy gave Gov.
Lester Maddox, who differed sharply with The Constitution on racial
issues, oversize ears.
</P>
<P>
   When African-American politicians began to hold public office in
Atlanta, they interpreted Baldy's technique as racist. They wanted
all politicians of color to have light skin and Caucasian features.
Troubled by this, Baldy consulted Dr. Martin Luther King. ``Just
draw us like you've been drawing white folks,'' King advised. With
King gone and changes at the newspaper, pressure mounted to make
all African-Americans look like Julian Bond.
</P>
<P>
   When Baldy drew a cartoon of a black city councilman with a hand
in a cookie jar, The Constitution, in what was not that great
newspaper's finest hour, published an apology. The last time I
looked, the gentleman apologized to was serving a jail sentence for
accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
   If I were colorblind, I wouldn't have noticed that about half
the mourners and one of the preachers at Baldy's funeral were not
white. If the preachers and eulogists had been colorblind, they
wouldn't have talked about how Baldy never succumbed to white
flight, never left his South Atlanta neighborhood, and how he stuck
with his church when the congregation no longer reflected the face
he saw in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Baldowski was a great man. What a fantastic city Atlanta
would be if it had more like him.

Journal-Constitution.

 &HT;    Taking a flight of fancy on a plane
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes I wonder what a stranger to our craft might
think if he got into the middle of a conversation betwen
woodworkers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a fellow on the Internet posts a message headed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Need a frog for a No. 8 Stanley plane - help!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps a No. 8 Stanley is sort of an offshoot of the old
Stearman, you know, the sort of biplane they still use for
crop-dusting, or maybe it's one of those early World War II
fighters. They had some pretty strange craft there at the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was a French aircraft, and this guy is being
extremely insensitive and politically incorrect and is demanding a
French national to fly his antique French airplane.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, maybe it's just some sort of wind-up thing
he's made with room for an amphibian inside, and he's trying to
prove the old adage about how if frogs could only fly, they
wouldn't be bumping their little bottoms all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me. Sometimes I have these seizures. For those still
with me, Stanley is a trade name, a plane is, of course, a bench
plane used for smoothing and leveling wood, and a frog is the
device that holds the plane iron in place. I cannot imagine why
it's called a frog, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, now, folks, from the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just finished gluing up a fairly good sized coffee table top
(34 by 53 inches) of 4-inch poplar boards about 3/4 inch thick. The
top is cupped about 1/2 inch. Do I start over with new boards,
being more careful this time (how can I prevent this?) Do I add
some cross boards underneath to try and flatten it by using
screws?''
</P>
<P>
   Preventing it is a lot easier than curing it. Assuming his wood
was dry, I suspect excessive clamp pressure was the problem. He
doesn't say whether the grain was running in the 34-inch dimension
or the 53-inch, but in either case that's too many boards to glue
up at once. The more pieces that are being laminated, the more
there is a tendency for the entire thing to cup under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The thing to do, of course, is to take the nine boards _ if
we're talking about the grain running in the longer direction _ and
glue them up in three sets of three boards each. When they're dry,
glue the three sets together.
</P>
<P>
   As for fixing it, I'd just cut it up again, add another board,
and reglue as above.

 &HT;    Schizophrenia, other diseases require much more than medicine
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The benefits of psychotherapy and social support,
long recognized in treating depressive disorders, also are gaining
acceptance as an essential element in treating schizophrenia and
other mental illnesses that involve psychoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that people with severe mental illness need more than
a pill and a doctor's visit,'' says Laurie Flynn, executive
director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).
Vicki Lynn Bentley of Dayton, founder of the area's Schizophrenics
Anonymous (SA) support group chapter, has known that for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medication is like a Band-Aid,'' says Bentley, explaining
the value of her psychotherapy at the VA Medical Center. ``A person
has symptoms _ hearing voices, anxiety, whatever _ and medication
alone is just like sticking a Band-Aid on a cut without adding any
medicine to it. The cut will take a lot longer to heal, if it ever
does heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia is a disorder characterized by delusions and
hallucinations, according to University of Florida researchers who
reported last month on brain structure differences that could lead
to tools for diagnosing or predicting the illness. The roughly 2.5
million schizophrenics in the United States might hear voices no
one else hears or sense they're being spied on or persecuted, but
they do not have the multiple personalities that pop culture often
erroneously attributes to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's marked by a feeling of: `I don't belong,''' says
psychologist Dennis O'Grady, who treats schizophrenics individually
and works with SA. ```And you're telling me by how you're treating
me that I am correct.'''
</P>
<P>
   Therapy helps schizophrenics see that the world isn't as
threatening and dangerous as their instincts tell them, O'Grady
says. It also can teach them how to cope with everyday stresses,
says Bentley, ``how to think of alternatives rather than suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   From cooking to people skills, she says, the mentally ill need
to learn life fundamentals that others take for granted. ``I don't
know why society thinks if you're mentally ill, you can't learn
anything. Nothing could be farther from the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, NAMI has tried to make support and knowledge
more available for those with psychoses by establishing what it
calls COPE, for Caring, Outreach, Partnership and Education. The
resource program, also directed toward family members, includes a
consumer guide about patient empowerment, a housing guide, a family
guide with productive ways of coping and a resource directory.

   SAT-MINORITIES (Colonie, N.Y.) _ For more than two years, the
Educational Testing Service has been fine-tuning a formula under
which students in certain socioeconomic categories could be labeled

minority students find the proposal _ which is unlikely to move

CATHOLIC SCHOOL SATIRE OFFERED IN `SUPERSTAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone who's ever wondered what's the opposite of Julia
Roberts, it's Mary Katherine Gallagher (Molly Shannon), that
awkward teenage girl with the horn-rimmed glasses and a too-short,
parochial-school uniform living inside almost every woman, that
socially deformed woman who lives in some girls.
</P>
<P>
   She has a hundred-dollar smile and, to quote Hal Hartley, is a
nymphomaniac who's never had sex. She just likes to simulate it on
trees and stop-sign poles _ only Wayne and Garth seemed
simultaneously more real and not of this Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar,'' an odd, hysterically pointed movie chapter in the
``Saturday Night Live'' heroine's screwball life, offers Mary
Katherine Gallagher as that lunatic manifestation of teenage lust
and better role model for girls than certain multiplatinum pop
stars. She's literally boy crazy and desperate to be the eye of the
storm of attention, even when she's working as the rewind girl at
the video store.
</P>
<P>
   Her sense of romance is outdone only by her sociopathic need for
fame. And her virginity would be on an eBay auction block if she
lived in a techno world. Instead she exists in a Catholic school
neverland that seems to be a distilled composite of 1982-1993, and
cool truly is a state of Shannon's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The film was directed by Bruce McCulloch, a ``Kids in the Hall''
guy who evidently was using the comically challenged,
blink-so-you'll-miss-it ``Dog Park'' as practice for this
infinitely more confident effort. And his basic goal here is to let
Shannon and the rest of ``Superstar's'' madly funny cast slapstick
themselves silly.
</P>
<P>
   The story, by Steve Koren, is simple: Mary Katherine wants to be
noticed by the curiously heterosexual Sky Corrigan (``SNL's'' Will
Ferrell), who's the best dancer in her Catholic school. (``He's the
Swayziest,'' swoons Mary Katherine's boyish pal, Helen, played by
Emmy Laybourne as Jan Brady on hormones.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sky has a bitch girlfriend named Evian (Elaine
Hendrix looking like Alicia Silverstone with a Britney Spear
through her heart), and the silent hunk in the bad leather jacket
(Harland Williams) from Mary Katherine's special-ed class has a
crush on her.
</P>
<P>
   Against her grandmother's (Glynnis Johns) better judgment, she
auditions for her school's ``Fight Against Venereal Disease''
talent contest, the winner going to Hollywood to star in a movie
with positive moral values _ what, like Pax's ``Little Convent on
the Prairie?''
</P>
<P>
   McCulloch arranges the film to feel like one long ad-lib crammed
with spontaneous musical numbers, the best of which busts out in
the cafeteria with Mary Katherine and Sky doing ``the robot'' with
the rest of the cast to ``Gonna Make You Sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they're bored at Mass, Mary Katherine and Helen play
``Supermodel Documentary Hour.'' As part of ``Superstar's'' silly
riffing on kids'-eye-view of Catholicism, Ferrell also plays Mary
Katherine's personal Jesus, who visits her in her bedroom, and Mark
McKinney plays neurotic Father Ritley. (And what's Canadian obnoxio
Tom Green doing here, just screaming at Mary Katherine?)
</P>
<P>
   It's Shannon who's at the center of the contagious nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   There's an unstable genius in the mild psychopath brewing
beneath Mary Katherine's scarlet headband. As ``SNL'' women go,
only Gilda Radner seemed as willing to rib so much of herself for
our pleasure.

`THE LIMEY' IS STEVEN SODERBERGH'S LATEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no maracas and nary a wah-wah guitar riff or
smacked-up cymbal to speak of, but director Steven Soderbergh and
writer Lem Dobbs' ``The Limey'' is atmospheric Champagne funk that
holds you under its spell long enough to make you believe Curtis
Mayfield is still in the soundtrack business.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Saber is behind most of the film's hollowed-out
jazz-tronica. But it's Soderbergh's Visine-clear vision and
unconventional skill at killing several narrative birds with a
single stylistic stone that elevates a relatively simple noir flick
into an ingeniously atavistic work of art, in which even the
editing is a slave to the rhythm. All this, despite the fact that
Soderbergh is after two divergent film moments from the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   With dueling smolder and self-doubt, Terence Stamp plays Wilson,
a small-time thief who's been in and out of jail and has just been
released into the L.A. wild after his latest nine-year stint. The
character is the older, more contemplative incarnation of the thug
Stamp played in Ken Loach's ``Poor Cow'' from 1967.
</P>
<P>
   It was a smallish part in a film that serves as ``The Limey's''
textual blueprint, providing actual flashbacks akin to old one-reel
home movies that are visual reminders of what a striking presence
Stamp was.
</P>
<P>
   In '67 Loach was figuring out the working-class assassin living
in his head, and Soderbergh has grown exceptionally at ease
exploring the super-fly, fun-lovin' criminal in his.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's looking to serve payback to the party responsible for
the death of his estranged daughter and all the signs point to his
daughter's last lover, a record producer named Valentine (Peter
Fonda). He's a guy who ``took the whole '60s Zeitgeist thing and
ran with it,'' as he's described to Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, who's somehow finding himself as an increasingly less
empty screen presence, is playing a shady, comically Bizarro shadow
of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually striking Lesley Ann Warren is in the cast. And
Nicky Katt and Barry Newman are excellent as a pool-hall thug and
Valentine's right-hand bastard who hires him to kill Wilson, both
of whom get to stretch out extended sub-plot-ish sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh was a writer-director who became a filmmaker under
our noses, like that girl who, as a party trick, removed her bra
without the exhibition of flesh but with the requisite modicum of
grace. He did this with a limited amount of fanfare as if after his
``sex, lies, &AMP; videotape'' breakthrough, he broke down, blinded by
the Sundance in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When he made 1994's ``The Underneath,'' an under-seen remake of
1949's ``Criss Cross,'' the fulgent palette and stylistic devices
seemed like a break in form. ``Out of Sight'' was further proof of
Soderbergh's assertion that noir needn't be. Now, with ``The
Limey,'' he's reconfigured the genre with Crayolas that fill in the
washed-out documentary overtones in Loach's first non-TV feature
just as it makes a term like neo-noir seem like a fatuous catch
phrase.

WHY NEW YORK ISN'T SHARING IN JOB GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. _ Throughout the 1990s, New York state has
ranked 49th in job creation and No. 2, just behind a statistical
anomaly called Alaska, in combined state and local per capita
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The question was asked: Did anybody perceive a relationship
between those two figures.
</P>
<P>
   This was a few weeks ago at the annual meeting of the Business
Council of New York State. Virtually everybody in that large
meeting room at the Sagamore on Lake George saw a direct and
disturbing relationship between those numbers. That seemed
especially true of the high-powered business people engaged in a
panel discussion of the state's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the stage were William F. Allyn of Skaneateles,
president of a successful company that makes medical and imaging
gear; Stanley J. Grubel of Hopewell Junction, the chief executive
of a semiconductor manufacturing operation; advertising agency
proprietor Eric Mower of Syracuse; Heidi A. Nauleau, who runs
several manufacturing companies in Jamestown; and Hector Hyacynthe,
of the Packard-Frank Organization in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   All agreed that New York's tax load is too heavy. All agreed
that it needs weight reduction. So did the audience. Tax-cutting,
after all, is a Business Council priority.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, where do you trim? Where are tax dollars being
gobbled up needlessly? Realistically speaking, where can New
Yorkers save public money without creating disaster and fostering
misery? Everybody had an idea or two. And ideas are desperately
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the rhetoric from the Pataki administration about
how wonderfully the Empire State is doing economically, the Federal
Reserve last month released a report documenting a rather startling
``brain drain'' from New York, especially upstate. Well-educated
New Yorkers in their 20s and 30s are leaving skid marks as they
flee to the South and West, where job opportunities for skilled
workers exist in relative abundance.
</P>
<P>
   How bad is it? Here are some dreary numbers on New York's
economic performance in the 1990s: New York job growth averaged 1
percent. National Average: 2.5 percent. You can argue that New York
already has the jobs while Arizona is still developing, and that's
true as far as it goes. But New York's job growth in the 1990s has
been only half that of Massachusetts and the rust belt states of
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The industries that lost the most jobs in this state during this
decade _ manufacturing, for example _ paid wages that topped the
statewide wage average by 53 percent. The industries that added
jobs, mainly the retail and service industries, pay wages that run
8 percent below the statewide average wage. The situation is
especially grim upstate. Upstarters are 37 percent of the state's
population, but New Yorkers north of Westchester enjoyed only 25
percent of the limited job growth. Bankruptcies are more common
upstate than downstate. New York mortgage foreclosures run 50
percent above the national rate.
</P>
<P>
   Energy costs and towering state energy taxes play a role in the
loss of manufacturing jobs in particular. But New York ranks in the
middle of the pack in per-capita state tax load. It ranks first in
local per-capita tax load. It's easy to see where much of the
problem lies _ in an old, outdated system of local government that
gives Albany _ a metropolitan area of less than a million people _
770 separate taxing units to support.
</P>
<P>
   Where Florida administers education at the county level, New
York clings to more than 850 separate school boards, each with its
own administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cut taxes? Sure, everybody wants to. But until New Yorkers grasp
the true nature of the problem and submit to combining local
governments and school districts to save real money, then nothing
much will change.
</P>
<P>
   And the jobs will keep going elsewhere.

THE MYSTERIES OF AUTOMATIC GARAGE DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 10)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM HEINS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The manual garage door is almost a thing of the
past.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like the convenience of an automatic door and
being able to drive into the protection of the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Recent improvements to sensors and door openers have increased
their usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, automatic garage doors have featured an invisible
backup light beam. The door's direction reverses if the beam is
disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   To check the safety of a garage door, place a small block of
wood in the area where the door closes. The door should go into
reverse upon contact with the block.
</P>
<P>
   If your garage door doesn't stop, call for a service check by a
reputable technician. Should you not have a safety reversing
feature, you may want to upgrade your opener with a new one that
meets all safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Follow a regular maintenance routine, even if you have a newer,
self-lubricating, automatic garage door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to have the hardware in top working
condition,'' stressed Joe Greene, owner of Greene Overhead Door of
Waterford, N.Y. ``Perhaps they may need to be repaired or replaced
since they were installed or last checked. The last thing you want
is for something that weighs several hundred pounds and moves over
your head to not be in excellent working condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Regular maintenance includes making sure the door remains
properly balanced, tightening hardware, such as hinges, lubricating
metal rollers, pulleys and cables, and spring adjustment. Safety
cables will keep the springs from flying out of control if they
should break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Springs stretch and eventually wear out or get rusty from lack
of care,'' added Greene. ``Lack of maintenance can make your garage
door wear out faster than normal. By servicing it once a year, you
can extend the life of your door.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are buying new, look for a good warranty and service
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warranties vary,'' said Tom Murphy, owner of Murphy Overhead
Doors in Albany. ``Most manufacturers offer a lifetime warranty
against rust-through on all steel doors. Some just cover rust. Look
for a warranty that covers rust, period. Otherwise, you need to
have a hole through the door caused by rust for the warranty to
kick in.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil Boers, owner of Ed's Overhead Doors in Niskayuna, N.Y.,
said that you shouldn't have to buy a service contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look to a warranty where the parts and labor are guaranteed
for the first year,'' said Boers.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers offer a lifetime warranty on the paint finish
and one to five years on the hardware. Shop around before deciding
on the make of door you are going to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can get a garage door to complement your home's
architectural style. Wood doors are traditional, but require
painting and can warp, crack or split over time. A custom-installed
wood automatic garage door costs approximately $500 to $2,500,
which includes removal of your old door.
</P>
<P>
   Steel insulated doors cost approximately $400 to $1,000 for a
standard size (7 feet high by 8 or 9 feet wide) single bay door.
The price depends on whether the door is strengthened with raised
panels or windows.
</P>
<P>
   John Meichtry, owner of Leo's Overhead Garage Doors in Troy,
said steel doors don't need painting, are lighter than wood and not
prone to dry rot. They can be insulated, which adds rigidity, or
uninsulated. Murphy said that the gauge of steel varies, and it
isn't listed in most literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lower the number, the thicker the gauge,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Another option for residential doors is vinyl, which can feature
2-inch-thick foam insulation, won't rust or dent, said Boers. A
standard size costs approximately $180 to $340.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic garage doors must have an emergency release that
allows the door to be operated manually.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent ``press'' button or key pad should be installed on
the garage door jamb out of the reach of small children. A wireless
keypad ($38 to $48) opens and closes the garage door when a
four-digit security code is entered.

AMWEST FAILED TO FIX DEVICE TIED TO MISHAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - An accident that in jured four flight attendants last
month is being blamed on a faulty warning system that America West
knew about but had not corrected, according to federal
investigators.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing its probe
of the Sept. 20 in-flight accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at why the problem persisted,'' said Bob
Crispin, a safety board investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots who flew the Boeing 757 aircraft before the accident
reported problems with the ground-proximity warning system.
Mechanics tested the device but did not find out what was wrong,
said Steve Johnson, America West chief administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what exact problems the pilots reported with the
computer warning system, but there had been no previous injuries on
America West as a result of a false warning, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the injured flight attendants, Celinda Levno, said she
hopes that the investigation improves safety at America West for
passengers and crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pain and suffering is worth it if it makes the airline
safer,'' said Levno, who broke her left leg and foot in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   The board is examining what main tenance America West performed
to repair the warning system and whether the problems were beyond
the scope of what the airline could have been expected to solve,
said Crispin, who is heading the investi gation.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say how long America West had been having trouble
with the warning system, but the board is checking maintenance
records of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a stack of paperwork 4 or 5 feet tall to go through,''
Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety board is researching whether there have been similar
problems on the warning systems for the worldwide fleet of Boeing
757s, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   Two flight attendants were seriously injured and two suffered
minor injuries in the sudden evasive maneu ver, according to the
board's prelimi nary accident report.
</P>
<P>
   An aircraft operation that results in a death, serious injury or
substantial damage to the plane is considered an accident by the
board.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was not damaged and none of the 170 passengers was
injured on Flight 2208, which was en route from Los Angeles to
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots Franklin Etter and John Spriggs reacted as they were
trained to do under the circumstances, Cris pin said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft was descending through clouds at a rate of about
4,000 feet per minute when the warning system sounded. Etter and
Spriggs pulled up on the aircraft at an altitude of 22,000 feet and
increased the engine power to maximum thrust. The plane's nose
pitched upward about 8 degrees, and the aircraft began to climb at
a rate of 3,400 feet per minute, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants in the back galley fell about 8 feet when
the cabin floor dropped out from under them, Crispin said, adding
that it's fortunate that the injuries were not more serious.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said one of the flight
attendants fractured her leg, another broke her ankle, a third
suffered a badly sprained knee and the fourth was badly bruised and
had neck and back injuries.
</P>
<P>
   None of the injured flight attendants has returned to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't return to work until they're healthy and ready to
fly again, and we don't know when that is,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ground-proximity warning sys tem, which alerts pilots if
they are flying too close to mountains or other terrain, is linked
with a plane's collision-avoidance system, which warns of nearby
aircraft, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   That system had alerted the America West pilots of a plane
passing 1,000 feet below them just before the ground-proximity
warning system sounded.
</P>
<P>
   America West has replaced the warn ing systems since the
accident and the plane was returned to service after an extensive
check by company mechanics, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the 13-year-old aircraft was grounded for scheduled
maintenance to examine the entire aircraft and its avionics, the
electronic and computer systems that control the plane, John son
said.
</P>
<P>
   That work is being done at a contract maintenance facility in In
dianapolis operated by United Air lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers of the warnings systems, AlliedSignal and
Rockwell Collins, are testing the devices that were removed after
the accident, Crispin said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been found wrong with the systems, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The board expects to issue a final accident report within six
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration in its initial accident
report cites improper maintenance as a factor but did not include
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 757 involved in the accident had a previous
mechanical failure, when the hydraulic system failed on July 4,
1997. The plane, which is painted with the Diamond backs logo, made
a safe emergency landing in Phoenix after circling for more than an
hour to burn fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe-based America West, the na tion's ninth-largest airline,
has never had a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   However, the carrier was fined $5 million in July 1998 by the
FAA for maintenance violations, one of the largest fines ever in
commercial-aviation history.
</P>
<P>
   America West paid half that fine immediately. FAA administrators
in Washington agreed to waive the remaining $2.5 million on July 14
after deciding that the Tempe-based carrier had complied with the
re quired corrective actions.
</P>
<P>
   But that decision went against the recommendation of Phoenix FAA
inspectors, who did not believe America West had complied.
</P>
<P>
   Local inspectors wanted to extend the compliance deadline and
use the remaining $2.5 million fine as lever age, but were
overruled. &QL;

LAKE CHAMPLAIN OFFERS A PARADISE FOR HUNTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED LeBRUN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITEHALL, N.Y. _ ``This will be the hardest duck hunt you've
ever loved, I promise,'' guide Brad Plummer said in a strained
whisper between shoves and lurches on our hung-up canoe.
</P>
<P>
   He surely didn't have to convince me how hard it would be. Here
it was 4:05 a.m., pitch black, and it really was slow going trying
to pull, push and tug a 14-foot Old Town Osprey loaded with
shotguns, decoys, and gear of all type about 100 yards through
thick cattails and reeds where one step you were above the water
line on sort-of solid ground, and the next you sank into mucky ooze
to your waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing great, we're doing just great,'' Plummer kept
saying between lurches, although I wasn't sure who he was trying to
convince.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet you $1,000 that when we get set up we will have the
place to ourselves and the hunting will be unbelievable. You will
see more ducks than you've ever seen in your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This very statement is what got me hooked on this hunt, and at
this point I was wondering just what I'd gotten myself into.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was opening morning of the first half of the waterfowl
season on both the Vermont and New York sides of Lake Champlain, an
incredible habitat for ducks that I'd witnessed with my own eyes,
but only in the off-season. I had never actually put a gun to it,
so I was definitely inclined. Plummer promised a classic Lake
Champlain-style duck hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's none of your heated blind, motor the boat right to it and
wait for the birds to fall out of the sky elite duck hunt. It's a
little more exercise than that, and you might get a little muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad is some salesman. Throw the physical challenge stuff at me
and I'll bite every time.
</P>
<P>
   So Plummer and his boat and I met at a fast-food shop at 2:30
a.m., then we drove 15 miles north of Whitehall along Champlain. At
a small, private dock, we launched his 16-foot Grumman Ranger with
an 18-hp Go-Devil designed to churn through the thickest duck weed
and swamp grass. After a half-hour in that salad, we suddenly
veered on the New York side into a broad, shallow bay jammed with
decoys. Aha, I thought. This must be it. Piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Somebody else's decoys.
</P>
<P>
   This was only the first leg, so to speak, because we unloaded
everything into the canoe and did what canoes don't do that well _
skated over land. The short of it is, after 5,000 calories we
finally crossed the reeds to Plummer's own favorite sink hole, a
hidden gem about 50 yards across, out of sight between two major
shooting galleries.
</P>
<P>
   We set the canoe on the sturdiest clumps of cattails we could
find back off the shore 10 feet and parallel to it with the wind to
our back. Plummer rigged a makeshift blind between us and the
water. We stood in the canoe, saw it was good, and got out our
shotguns and shell boxes. It was 5:30, an hour before shooting
time. Hmmm, I thought, this is going to work out great after all.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within 10 minutes, the temperature dropped to within a few
degrees of freezing, the wind whipped up and it started to rain. At
the same time, a flashlight suddenly bobbed 30 feet away, attached
to another hunter and his faithful Labrador. I could hear Plummer
groan, ``I can't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take that $1,000 in small bills,'' I muttered quietly.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour before sunrise, if there had been a sun, the
remarkable stillness in all directions was shattered with gunfire
from 30 different unseen blinds. Then I remembered what Plummer had
said about Lake Champlain duck hunts.
</P>
<P>
   This is mostly a public shoreline, and these duck hunters are
not apt to be Orvis-decorated. This is the people's duck hunt, and
there are a lot of them. These folks love their ducks. Then again,
there also are an incredible number of ducks to love. In the
thousands. Wave after flock, singles and doubles came at us from
every direction, with never more than a three- or four-minute break
in the action.
</P>
<P>
   Woodducks, blue and green-winged teal flying in their
characteristically low, fast and erratic manner. Bigger black ducks
and mallards doing their B-52 imitations higher up, out of range
except for the big 10-gauges, which we did not have.
</P>
<P>
   I was used to river duck hunting, and this was a different game.
Along a river, the ducks generally fly up or down stream. In
Plummer's sink hole, they came at us like a three-dimensional
arcade game, from every point of the compass and at full speed,
right out of the cattails. A shot-shell manufacturer's dream.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, we were in the ideal position thanks to
Plummer's guiding, and the other hunter got off only a few shots at
our rejects. Both Plummer and I maxed out on our limits of six each
by 9 a.m., mostly teal, which I adore. We easily could have doubled
that if it were legal, or halved the shooting time.
</P>
<P>
   Except Plummer's rule applied. He allowed us to shoot only at
ducks that would fall in the sink hole in front of us. We had no
dog, and the only retrieving we could do was with the canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, each of us shot a bird that accidentally fell not 15
feet into the rushes. We looked for an hour and a half and found
neither one, a bitter lesson. We both felt bad enough over losing
those birds that neither of us shot anymore. Enough.
</P>
<P>
   A warm sun came out, the wind abated. I looked down at two empty
boxes of shotgun shells and spent hulls in all directions, and a
boat full of ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you can keep your money,'' I told Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   It was everything he said it would be, a phenomenal duck hunt,
Champlain-style. Which also means on the way out we discovered the
wind had pushed the water right out of the bay where we'd beached
the big boat, and we had all we could do, after expending another
5,000 calories, to get out of there without a tow.
</P>
<P>
   He warned we'd get a little muddy. He was right about that, too.

A CLEAR CHOICE: WRITER SHARES HER EXPERIENCE WITH POPULAR EYE
SURGERY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Monday, Oct. 11) 
 
By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you have always struggled to see, then you have
always known me.
</P>
<P>
   I was the kid the teacher thought was slow because I couldn't
see the blackboard; the geek in the Coke-bottle glasses that
everyone called four eyes; the one who went from hard contacts to
gas permeable to soft and finally back to glasses, this time,
bifocals.
</P>
<P>
   If you have struggled to see forever, then you know why I spent
more than $4,300 five months ago to fix what, for most of my life,
has been unfixable.
</P>
<P>
   Myopia, or nearsightedness, is caused by eyes that are too long
from front to back. Astigmatism, caused by an irregularly curved
cornea, blurs vision as well. I had both, and badly, when I decided
to undergo LASIK, short for laser in-situ keratomileusis and
currently all the rage for restoring normal vision.
</P>
<P>
   At the onset, you should know this: LASIK is not for the faint
of heart. Consider the informed consent agreement I signed: ``I
understand it is possible that a perforation of the cornea could
occur, causing devastating complications, including the loss of
some or all my vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Other daunting warnings include the possibility of
``starbursting'' around lights, resulting in a halo effect,
increased difficulty focusing at night and permanent
over-correction from nearsightedness to farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
   I pressed on; some understandably do not.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``flap and zap'' in the industry, LASIK treats the
middle layers of the cornea to correct nearsightedness,
farsightedness and astigmatism. Numbing drops are administered to
prevent pain. A vacuum ring props the eyelids open. A thin flap is
sliced on the cornea with a device called a microkeratome and
folded back. Microscopic layers of the exposed tissue are vaporized
with an excimer laser to slightly reshape the cornea.
</P>
<P>
   The actual application of the laser takes 10 to 90 seconds, and
the hinged flap is gently returned to its original position. In the
best-case scenario, the eye heals without incident and the chance
of seeing 20/40 or better (the legal vision to drive without
glasses) can exceed 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the patients' perspective, it's a miracle. It's an
extraordinary transformation of their vision,'' says Dr. Douglas
Koch, professor of ophthalmology with Baylor Laser Vision at
Houston's Baylor College of Medicine and the physician who
performed my procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the demand for LASIK surgery has skyrocketed,
from 200,000 procedures in 1998, to an expected 800,000 this year.
Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, race-car driver Bryan Herta
and a legion of professional sports players have bared their
eyeballs for the laser.
</P>
<P>
   Ophthalmologists' offices are mobbed with people who want to
toss their glasses and see the world in all its peripheral glory.
They want to water-ski and workout without prescription goggles.
</P>
<P>
   Vanity certainly plays a part, but most want the simple
pleasures: waking up in the morning and reading the alarm clock;
falling asleep on the couch while watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   That was me. I've awoken so long to dimness and stumbled around
in a world full of blobs, I just wanted to sharpen some edges. I
did a massive Internet search and considered the options, the
surgeries, the risks and benefits, the clinics and the doctors. By
the time I walked into Baylor's Alkek Eye Center a year ago, I was
a go.
</P>
<P>
   At least from my end.
</P>
<P>
   My first ``screening'' to determine if I was a good LASIK
candidate was a bust. According to Koch, a pioneer in the field, I
have what are called ``trace'' cataracts in the center of both
eyes. If the cataracts were growing, they could require surgery as
soon as a year or two, Koch said; it would be imprudent to subject
each eye to two surgeries in that short space of time.
</P>
<P>
   Now that was a devastating complication.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a second screening four months later showed
that the cataracts were stable, not growing, and could be decades
away from being a problem. Now I was a go.
</P>
<P>
   Of the actual surgery, I can tell you this: I was trembling and
given a Valium (thank you, laser team). I got a running
play-by-play (thank you, Dr. Koch). It was over in a flash and
didn't hurt (thank you, God).
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to say I awoke the next morning to a brand-new world,
but that's not the way it went.
</P>
<P>
   One eye was good from the get-go; my vision so bright and clear,
I drove that afternoon. The other was bad from the start; my vision
pained and blurred from debris (dead cells, deposits and the like)
that had ended up beneath the corneal flap.
</P>
<P>
   The next month was hell. The bad eye was as bad as the good eye
was good. It hurt, kept me up at night, interfered with work,
worried me no end. No matter what combination of drops the doctors
prescribed, the debris didn't go away, and neither did the pain. I
felt fragile, blind.
</P>
<P>
   Koch kept telling me they had ways of getting me to where they
wanted me. In the end, that way was lifting the corneal flap,
scraping away the debris and irrigating the heck out of it. That
was longer than the initial surgery and, since I was now less
confident, it was scarier. But it worked.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I finally awoke to that brave new world, and my
life has not been the same since. I see the alarm clock in the
morning. I see the leaves on the trees outside, in all their
dazzling detail. I see my mom's needlepoint on the wall, not just
the pink of the flowers and the green of the leaves, but the actual
dots of the thread. I see all this, and I am profoundly grateful.
</P>
<P>
   At Baylor, Koch and his partner, M. Bowes Hamill, turn away
perfectionists who will be disappointed with anything less than
contact-lens clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``That level of expectation is too high,'' says Koch. ``This is
elective surgery. You have to be twice as careful with this. The
stakes are much higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill, an ophthalmologist for the Houston Astros, discouraged
two professional baseball players who were seeking LASIK surgery.
The men wore contact lenses only during games, and Hamill told them
the slight risk inherent in LASIK wasn't worth the convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pretty careful about it. This is not a mill,'' says
Hamill. ``Our goal is not high volume.''
</P>
<P>
   LASIK normally costs $2,000-plus per eye. It's not usually
covered by health insurance, doesn't always work and, when it
doesn't, your vision could be worse for life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter McDonnell, chairman of the American Academy of
Ophthalmology's Refractive Surgery Interest Group, says about 1
percent of his patients have had worse vision; Koch and Hamill put
their complication rate at 1 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   I was a temporary member of that 1 percent club. But last week,
still in the six-month healing period, I read the eye chart
somewhere between 20/20 and 20/16 with both eyes. That varies
depending on how tired I am, how long I've stared at the computer
and how dry my eyes have gotten. I still need reading glasses; that
loss of focusing is caused by age and is not surgically
correctable. I still sometimes strain to see. I still worry about
the cataracts and the long-term health of my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond three years, the consent form plainly tells you, the
effects of LASIK are not known. Your vision could regress, your
nearsightedness could return. But then I knew, even as they were
throwing all those different drops at my bad eye, that, to a
degree, these doctors are charting new territory.
</P>
<P>
   I don't really care.
</P>
<P>
   At midlife, I won't be around to catch a fraction of what the
millennium brings in the way of medical miracles, and I envy all
those who will.
</P>
<P>
   But I have lived long enough to see a lifetime of blurriness
snap into shocking clarity, and I'll take that.
</P>
<P>
   I'll awake to my mom's needlepoint in the morning, walk out the
door in my high-toned sunglasses, look at the day in all its
brilliance and, for however long it lasts, I'll say a grateful
prayer. &QL;

GIVING EXTRA POINTS TO MINORITIES ON SAT EXAMS IS STILL DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Ask J.J. Harvey if he should get extra points on
his SAT score because he's African American and you'll get a
puzzled look followed by a brief show of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose idea was that?'' asked the senior at Colonie Central
High School. Automatically adding points to the Scholastic
Assessment Test scores of minority students, Harvey said, would
simply reinforce the stereotype that blacks are poor students.
</P>
<P>
   Said Shontell Smith, another black member of the school's class
of 2000: ``I'd like the extra points but not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding points for minority or disadvantaged students, though, is
exactly what the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which designs
the SAT, has considered. For more than two years, ETS has been
fine-tuning a formula under which such students in certain
socioeconomic categories could be labeled as ``strivers'' and
qualify for additional points.
</P>
<P>
   It's based on the idea that some disadvantaged students will
score higher than predicted, and those students, because they show
promise, should get a leg up in the college admissions game.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantaged student who scored 1,000 of a possible 1,600
points on the combined math and verbal test, for instance, is
probably scoring about 200 points better than expected, according
to ETS researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the strivers concept, several socioeconomic factors in
addition to race would be plugged into the equation. Variables such
as the education levels of a student's parents and even the number
of books in the student's home could come into play.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strivers concept is only that: a tentative idea that
ETS has put forward. It is not likely to be enacted anytime soon.
The College Board, the association of colleges that hires ETS to
write and score the SATs, quickly rebuffed the idea, saying the
college admissions process is too full of subtleties to be reduced
to a formula.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that ETS has looked at a strivers category
underscores the thorny issue of how college admissions officers
balance measurable academic achievements such as grades and
standardized test scores, against intangible characteristics such
as the drive or motivation that a student needs in order to
overcome barriers to scholastic success.
</P>
<P>
   That's an issue that has become as perennial as the SATs
themselves, which will begin being administered Saturday in
selected schools across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   SATs are a fall ritual for thousands of students, especially in
the eastern states, where the test is used as a yardstick by most
colleges and universities. They are offered several times
throughout the year, with many of the October participants taking
the test again in hopes of raising their scores.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that students may go through the test process twice
speaks to the importance that SATs play in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   There is an entire industry devoted to preparing students for
the test, and some high schools, including Colonie Central, have
developed their own after-school test-prep programs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet guidance counselors like Colonie Central's Jack Cramer
stress that the SATs aren't the only measure of a student. ``I
would pretty much expect that they take into account a student's
background and extenuating circumstances,'' Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Like admissions counselors at most schools, those at Skidmore
College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., recognize that students from
different backgrounds have unique characteristics that can't be
measured with an SAT number, said Mary Lou Bates, who heads the
school's admissions office. ``There's no hard and fast number,''
Bates said when asked if there is an SAT cutoff score for admission
to Skidmore.
</P>
<P>
   The imprecise nature of what SAT scores mean, however, is
precisely the problem with these tests in the first place, critics
say, adding that the strivers concept proves their point.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the issue of strivers marks ``the first time on record a
very senior person at ETS has said a combined score of 1,000 on the
SAT is not always 1,000,'' said Robert Schaeffer, public education
director for Fair Test, a Cambridge, Mass.-based group that is
critical of standardized tests like the SATs.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwick College is one of a handful of schools that will accept
applications without SAT scores, if a student thinks they aren't
reflective of his or her true abilities. About 11 percent of the
roughly 2,000 students seeking admission to the Oneonta, N.Y.-based
school leave out their SAT scores in their applications. Still,
despite those obvious doubts about the SAT's effectiveness,
Hartwick Dean of Admissions Susan Dileno says a strivers category
would at least provide a tool for quantifying socioeconomic
factors. ``From my discussions with other admission colleagues,
there seems to be a real interest in it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, however, Dileno stressed that good admissions
officers will look at a variety of factors, including the rigor of
courses a student takes in high school. Most admissions officers,
she said, are more impressed with tougher courses, such as those on
the honors or advanced-placement levels, than a high SAT score.

   So you are a gay guy, and are compelled to tell a straight buddy
from college whom you haven't seen in a while that you are
homosexual. You are not exactly sure how he is going to react, so
you break the news:
</P>

   _ In a bar, so both of you at least can get hammered if he can't

   ``Wasteland,'' a new ABC drama chronicling a group of friends in
their mid-20s living in Manhattan, debuted Thursday night. And yes,

<P>
   And her whole gang has baggage. Dawnie titles the life of people
in their 20s as ``The Wasteland.'' Single, 20-year-olds living in
New York City who have disposable income _ no, who are not living
in an old Maytag box _ should not whine. Ever. In fact, message to
Hollywood: You are not making us feel empathy toward the
complainers. You are making us ticked off. Teen angst? Sure.
Twenties angst? Shut up.

   The network now has a merely semi-decent twentysomething show

<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Forty queens at one homecoming might seem like
wretched excess, but excess is what homecoming is all about in
Vidor, a town of 11,000 just east of here.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 39 previous homecoming queens to greet the 1999
queen when she is crowned at halftime during Vidor High School's
football game Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The flashing black and gold of the Pirates band will be mirrored
by golden fireworks flashing through the dark skies. The stadium
will go dark while twirlers perform, not with batons, but with
flaming torches. Earlier in the day, Main Street will be shut down
for a big parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we go all out for homecoming,'' said Diana Walles Pierce,
the 1968 queen. ``We do it right. We don't always win the ballgame,
but we do have the best homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tradition that's been going on for half a century, and
this year the school invited all 50 previous queens to come home
again. Thirty-nine accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Taylor of the class of '56, who took on the job of tracking
down the former queens, figured 20 of them would come back for this
year's extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at the response,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the former queens still live in Vidor. Most of the
others live across Texas, but some live as far away as Ohio. Many
are in business; some are educators. One, Tammy Hext, the 1980
queen, went on to win the Miss Texas pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Taylor took on the job of inviting the 102
football captains from the previous years to homecoming. All but
five showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those football captains were later married to Pierce, who
is now a divorced grandmother living in Beaumont and operator of a
massage therapy studio in Vidor.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce and the other queens will gather for a noon luncheon in a
Vidor tea room Friday and then ride down Main Street in
convertibles in a big parade that starts at 2 p.m. CST. Most of the
cars are being provided by the Corvette Club of Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   And while Taylor wasn't a homecoming queen, she did write the
school fight song back in 1954 that is still sung at football
games. ``Every time I hear it,'' she said, ``I get a thrill.''

HOW TO CONTROL THE PESKY DIALUP BOX: KEEP WINDOWS CLOSED TO PROTECT
PC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I upgraded to Windows 98 Second Edition on my
computer, and now it's doing the most irritating thing. Whenever I
start my computer, a box pops up that wants to dial my Internet
provider. I can't figure out how to make this go away.
</P>
<P>
   A: This is an annoying side effect to a useful feature that's
included in Internet Explorer 5, the browser that is put on your
system when you install Windows 98 SE.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that IE5 can do is to better manage multiple
dialup accounts. With earlier versions of Windows 95/98 and
Internet Explorer, it was difficult to keep different dialup
settings from conflicting with each other.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you needed to have one set of settings for your
Internet provider and another for getting onto your company's
network, you might find you had to manually put them in each time
you wanted to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   With this latest version of both the operating system and the
browser, there's now an area in the browser that lets you keep
connections separate. However, it also adds a layer of complexity
that results, for some folks, in this dialog box popping up when
it's not wanted.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is that some component of Windows is trying to
get to the Internet. It could be the Windows Update Notification
feature, which checks the Windows Update Web page for fixes and
patches to the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   When it tries to connect to the Net and finds no pathway, it
launches this Dialup Networking box automatically. What you want is
to tell the system not to do that.
</P>
<P>
   To turn off the box, go to the Internet Options module in the
Control Panel (or right-click on the Internet Explorer icon and
choose Properties). Click on the Connection tab.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see three choices in that window: Never dial a
connection, Dial whenever a network connection is not present, and
Always dial my default connection. To turn the box off, click the
first item.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you may still get that box. In that case, you'll
have to change one more setting.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the Dialup Networking folder in My Computer, and choose
Connections, then Settings. Make sure Don't prompt to use Dialup
Networking is checked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the weather starting to cool off, my wife and I again
are having our ages-old argument _ do we have to keep the air
conditioning on to keep out the humidity, or can we turn it off and
throw open the windows? I argue that because we have a home
computer network, we need not only to keep it cool, but also dry.
She doesn't buy it. Who's right?
</P>
<P>
   A: You would think I'd know better than to step into this one,
but I'll take a shot at it. You are right, but mainly because you
live in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is known for its high humidity, and that can indeed
shorten the lifespan of a PC. When it's hot outside, you definitely
want to have the air conditioning on, particularly if you have a
modern-era PC with its superfast chips that run hot. Extreme heat
is a major enemy to PC components.
</P>
<P>
   However, even when its cool, there's a danger that the humid air
could cause condensation on the metal parts of a PC when you turn
it off. Water on the internal components of a PC is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean you should always run your air conditioner? Not
necessarily. Heaters also dry the air, so no need to try to run the
AC when it's chilly. However, if the humidity level gets to the
point where you feel physically uncomfortable in mild temperatures,
it's probably best to close the windows and turn down the
thermostat.

THERE ARE MANY GOOD CHOICES FOR IMAGE EDITING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Digital image editing, once the domain of professional graphics
artists, is going mainstream. Once your mom starts scanning your
embarrassing baby pictures, the next logical step is for her to
alter them in some way, particularly if she's going to post them on
her home page and invite your friends to come see.
</P>
<P>
   To change those picture files, she'll need software. Programs
that can be used to work with digital images _ whether they're
canned, scanned or snapped with a digital camera _ vary from the
simple and slick to the complex and powerful. Fortunately, you have
many choices.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at three new versions of some of the most popular
image editors, with choices for dabbling novices, those who need
less hand-holding and, finally, those who are serious about working
with graphics.
</P>
<P>
   _ PhotoSuite III Platinum Edition, $50, MGI Software: Like its
primary competitor, Adobe PhotoDeluxe, PhotoSuite III groups the
most common tasks used in working with digital pictures into
specific categories. This includes getting pictures, editing them,
organizing them into groups, composing them in projects and sharing
them with others.
</P>
<P>
   But PhotoSuite III also lets you browse images on the Net and
pull them easily into the editor. The Windows software includes a
version of Internet Explorer, which essentially turns the entire
Web into your own personal photo album.
</P>
<P>
   I like PhotoSuite's interface, which puts the image you're
changing in the middle of a three-paned window. On the left are the
tools you use to make the changes, and on the right are more images
to choose from, grouped into photo albums.
</P>
<P>
   There are the basic set of image-editing tools for selecting and
altering parts of a picture _ such as painting, cropping, rotating
and so on _ and another set of fun special effects. My favorite is
Mirage, which can make part of your picture appear ghostlike.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two truly new features here as compared with the
previous version. The best one, Auto-Stitch, lets you join images
to create panoramas. Let's say you wanted to take a picture of your
house, as well as the homes on either side of yours. You could take
a photo of each, and then let the program piece them together into
one wide-angle image.
</P>
<P>
   The second new feature, called PhotoTapestry, is primarily a
snazzy special effect. It takes your image and recomposes it using
thousands of tiny, smaller pictures. How well this works depends on
the image you're working with _ larger pictures with less detail
are best. Intricate images tend to come out looking like mud.
</P>
<P>
   While PhotoSuite III has lots of features, you're fairly limited
because its design is primarily aimed at novices. In other words,
you're protected from the nitty-gritty of photo editing by the
friendly interface. If you're a little more experienced at working
with images, you may want to consider this next choice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paint Shop Pro 6.0, $109, Jasc Software: What began as a
humble shareware image editor has been developed into the best
Windows-based software for middle-level users. And even some pros
love Paint Shop Pro, preferring its intuitive interface over
higher-powered products such as the venerable PhotoShop.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this is my image editor of choice. I use it to do the
graphics at my personal Web site at www.neosoft.com/dwights/.
</P>
<P>
   With version 5.0, Jasc added the ability to do layers _ you can
alter one part of a picture without affecting the rest of it _ and
6.0 further refines this. It also now comes with vector drawing
tools, which make it easier to draw pictures with Paint Shop Pro.
Vector-based images are stored differently than the traditional
images created with Paint Shop _ called raster images _ and can be
manipulated differently. This gives the program more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Jasc also has added features designed just for images to be used
on the Web. Tools let you fiddle with the attributes of GIF and
JPEG graphics files so they are smaller and load faster on a Web
page.
</P>
<P>
   The interface has been slightly reworked, so that some menu
items have icons that clue you in on what they do. And the floating
toolbars and palettes now roll up, window-shade style, when you're
not working with them.
</P>
<P>
   You can download a fully functioning version of Paint Shop Pro
6.0 at www.jasc.com.
</P>
<P>
   In beefing up its capabilities, though, Paint Shop Pro is
starting to become a bit harder to use. It's not quite as simple as
it once was, though it certainly remains easier to use than the
next choice on this list.
</P>
<P>
   _ PhotoShop 5.5, $649, Adobe Systems: No professional graphics
artist worth his or her trackball is going to be without PhotoShop.
This program, available for both Windows and Macintosh systems, is
the ultimate tool for working with images and getting them into
print or onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   You can do almost anything you want to with PhotoShop. The tough
parts are paying for it and then figuring out how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   With version 5.5, Adobe has added features designed to make it
easier to produce images for online use. PhotoShop began life aimed
at getting images onto paper. However, as the Web evolved, artists
also found it was great for online work. Adobe's now giving those
artists tools they've been asking for.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you've probably seen cool Web sites with rollovers
_ graphics or text that change when you move your mouse over them.
PhotoShop now automates the process of making them, generating the
Javascript coding that's necessary for the effect.
</P>
<P>
   It also now has a slick feature that, like Paint Shop Pro, lets
you adjust the size and colors used in graphics so they load faster
on the Web. You can compare the same graphic rendered in several
different ways to get a balance of speed and visual quality.
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorite new features is an automated contact-sheet
creator. Just tell PhotoShop what images to include, and it will
arrange them on a virtual contact sheet. You can even include
captions. This also can be used to generate a Web page of
thumbnails that link to bigger images.
</P>
<P>
   While PhotoShop's interface remains daunting, Adobe has improved
the tutorial and help files. This helps the learning curve a bit,
but PhotoShop remains a program aimed at _ and priced for _
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   A demo version of PhotoShop for both Windows and Macintosh is
available at www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/demodnld.html.

TEACHERS GO BEGGING FOR THEIR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ These were the best-received panhandlers in the
history of San Francisco. On Thursday, a dozen teachers stood on
the median strip of Van Ness Avenue in front of City Hall, begging
drivers for help and holding signs such as ``Got paper?'' and ``Got
pencils?''
</P>
<P>
   Like hundreds of other motorists, the driver of a tour bus
tooted his horn in support. But what would the tourists think of
San Francisco, Money magazine's choice as the best place to live in
America, knowing our teachers have to spend their own money on
pencils for students?
</P>
<P>
   In the Great Depression, people sold pencils. In the Golden Age
of initial public stock offerings and the Internet, teachers are
begging for pencils.
</P>
<P>
   They did get some paper. The driver of a Kinko's truck
spontaneously dropped off a carton of copying paper. The teachers
scurried to get packs of it to take back to their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't even know we're spending our own money on
supplies for our kids,'' said Mark Sanchez, a fourth-grade teacher
at Paul Revere School, who spends about $600 a year on art paper
and supplies of all kinds. ``The administration never acknowledges
it, much less thanks us.''
</P>
<P>
   You've never seen panhandlers like this. You'll see them again.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be back every month on that median strip in front of
City Hall, publicizing other teachers' issues, like oversize
classes and lack of prep time. And they'll continue begging for
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Rothman, a fifth-grade teacher at Paul Revere, says she
spent $700 on her kids last year. One of Rothman's former students,
11-year-old Gregory Howard, arrived on roller skates to pass out
leaflets for the teachers in front of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came to support her,'' he said. ``She buys pencils,
paper, crayons, glue _ all the things to do all kinds of
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   Susie Siegel, a kindergarten teacher at Yick Wo School, kept
running into stopped traffic to hand out leaflets to drivers. ``I
risk my life every day for the kids,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most years I spend over $4,000,'' said Siegel, who says she
deducts it from her income taxes. ``That's almost 10 percent of my
$45,000 salary. When I need to buy snacks for my kids, I buy it,
because they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not activists,'' Sanchez said. ``We're teachers. We're
fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his fellow panhandlers have started a group called
Teachers4Change and a Web site. ``When we started our Web site, we
wanted a conduit,'' Sanchez said. There's so much wealth out there.
There's so much largess. We eventually want our own warehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez and the other teachers are begging for pencils, crayons,
markers, paper of all kinds, educational games, posters, books,
computers, printers, everything that the school district and the
state should be supplying to classrooms, but aren't.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him if that didn't relieve the school district of
its responsibilities, Sanchez said, ``I'm a realist.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these teachers are regular customers of Mike Ghiorso's
store, the Educational Exchange on 35th Avenue. This former teacher
sells school supplies to teachers, right now dealing in a lot of
Halloween materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of buying back your time _ literally,'' said
Ghiorso, referring to purchasing materials in his store rather than
making them. ``It's much more productive to be doing lesson plans
than to spend your time drawing squares.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez and the other panhandlers weren't aware of it, but the
administrators' union has a proposal before the Board of Education
to raise the amount of money allocated to each school for supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Judy Coenen of Robert Louis Stevenson School calls her
union's proposal a ``cost-of-learning adjustment.'' For as long as
Coenen can remember, at least 12 years, each elementary school has
received $19.80 for each student from the school district. Middle
schools get around $25 per student and high schools $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your basic bread-and-butter money for paper, pencils,
glue, toners, and all the new things we didn't have 12 years ago,
like printers and ink cartridges,'' Coenen said. ``You name it, and
it covers it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it doesn't cover it. Coenen says the money only covers
half the year. All Coenen and other principals are asking is an
extra $5 per pupil per year.
</P>
<P>
   When are we going to stop subtracting the cost of their pencils
and paper from the already meager salaries of teachers?
</P>
<P>
   Katie Sedgwick, a fourth-grade teacher at Paul Revere School,
said, ``We don't have enough books to go around, so we end up
photocopying our supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, but no panhandler ever grabbed a quarter as
gratefully as these teachers clutched their packs of Kinko's paper.

BIAS TAKES TOLL ON HEAVY PEOPLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Kendra Kennon is a large woman who weighs 100 pounds
more than her ``ideal'' weight.
</P>
<P>
   Kennon is also charming, attractive and lively _ everything that
most companies would want in a customer service representative.
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest Airlines doesn't want her because she can't fit
into a size 18 uniform _ the largest size the airline will allow
for its customer service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Kennon said the problem surfaced when she arrived at a job
interview. After the Southwest recruiter cleared the basics _ that
everyone getting interviewed that day must go to Dallas for
training, that everyone must be available to work on holidays _ the
issue of size came up.
</P>
<P>
   Kennon, who wears what's known as a ``plus size'' 22-24, said
she was told in front of a dozen people there for the interview
that the airline doesn't provide large-size uniforms, but perhaps
the airline had a job ``in the back'' for her away from the public
view. Southwest doesn't have a uniform-size standard for jobs out
of the spotlight such as reservation sales agents.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear, said Kennon, who has two years of college and four
years of customer service experience, that Southwest was sending a
message that heavier people aren't good enough to work out front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors tell you to accept your body size and be healthy and
happy and live a normal life,'' Kennon said. ``But it's hard to
accept yourself when you can't get a job when you're heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines is adamant that it hasn't broken any laws.
</P>
<P>
   Appearance standards, including a restriction on uniform sizes,
are legally acceptable, said Melanie Jones, spokeswoman for
Southwest Airlines in Dallas. Unlike race, sex or national origin,
large size is not a protected class, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MARGINALIZED GROUP &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's true, said Bettye Travis, president of the National
Associaton to Advance Fat Acceptance. And that won't change until a
law is passed making it illegal to discriminate based on body size,
just as there are rules that forbid discrimination based on race or
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Fat people are the last group of marginalized Americans, said
Travis, who also is the co-owner of Spun Sugar, a cake decorating,
candy-making and coffee shop in Berkeley, Calif. People don't feel
embarrassed humiliating heavy people.
</P>
<P>
   Talk-show hosts would never make fun of someone's race, but they
often joke about body size, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, there is little to no education on size acceptance, Travis
said. Some overweight children commit suicide because of the
humiliation by their peers. However, if a child were getting
tormented because of his race or national origin, the schoolteacher
would certainly step in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has a long-held belief that appearance counts. In
1971, the ``Luv'' airline argued to a federal judge in Dallas that
its flight attendants must wear hot pants and go-go boots because
the airline catered mostly to businessmen then.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the argument the airline made that it had a business
necessity to require the sexy garb, the court ruled the airline was
in the transportation business and had no legitimate business
reason to deny men flight-attendant jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The same people running the company today dictated the hot pants
and go-go boots, said Scott Pawgan, the lawyer who is representing
Kennon. They're still focused on attractiveness.
</P>
<P>
   And Pawgan says there may be a problem with race and gender,
claiming black women tend to be overweight compared to other racial
groups. And, men's uniforms are based just on waist sizes (between
27 and 42), so if a man has a huge chest, he wouldn't be denied the
job.
</P>
<P>
   If a taller-than-average woman applied for the job, she might
require a size larger than 18 even if she were relatively trim,
Pawgan said. And, though it sounds strange, a man who is unusually
tall could fit into a woman's uniform because Southwest considers
only waist size. He'd get the job, but she wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIZING UP THE ISSUE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Continental Airlines doesn't have a size limit for
its customer service agents, spokeswoman Sarah Anthony said. Its
standard uniform size goes up to 28, and if someone is larger, the
airline will make a uniform to measure.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled
Southwest Airlines had discriminated against Kennon on a perceived
disability claim. But the agency reversed itself last month,
contending that it made a mistake and has referred the issue to
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Kennon, meanwhile, has taken a job as a bill collector to pay
her own bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want big people to know that Southwest Airlines doesn't
want us to work in the front lines where the customers might see
us,'' she said. ``So maybe they won't want to fly with them.''

 &HT;    A BAD SEQUEL: RUSSIA ATTACKS AND MISERY PREVAILS IN CHECHNYA
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE CHECHNYA-INGUSHETIA BORDER _ Like a recurring nightmare,
life for the last two weeks has been horrifyingly familiar for
Tamara Akimarova and her family, refugees forced to flee their home
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   They survived the war from 1994-96 only to be uprooted again two
weeks ago after Russian planes strafed their neighborhood in the
city of Urus-Martan. The school where Akimarova, 42, teaches was
destroyed by a Russian bomb, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen family members have been on the run from the war ever
since, living out of a dilapidated Soviet-made microbus. The oldest
is Akimarova's 87-year-old grandmother and the youngest is her
7-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   They have settled in a refugee camp just inside Chechnya, near
the border with the neighboring Russian region of Ingushetia.
There, the van rests in the grassy field next to a row of tents.
</P>
<P>
   With relief supplies desperately low, there were no more tents
to be had for Akimarova and her family, so they sleep in the open,
with blankets they salvaged from home. Supper is a meager
assortment of sliced cucumbers, potatoes and bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we to blame for it? The Russians have bad people. We
have bad people. But why are we punished?'' she asked, tears
welling in her dark eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent refugees streaming out of Chechnya say they are
trapped between Moscow's imperial fury toward the southern republic
and ruthless Chechen warlords who will stop at nothing short of an
independent Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   This sequel to the war in Chechnya could have been avoided, they
say, if only both sides would talk. This reprise will be as bloody
and senseless as the first one, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive began last month after a series of terror
attacks on apartment buildings in Moscow and other cities killed
nearly 300 people. Russian officials have blamed Chechnya for
supporting terrorists and allowing Islamic guerrillas in August to
invade neighboring Dagestan, a southern republic under Russia's
control.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, Russian ground forces _ 50,000 strong along the
border with Chechnya _ had taken control of the northern third of
Chechnya, to a line roughly following the Terek River. A report in
the newspaper Izvestia said that Russian generals had drawn up
plans for an invasion of the capital, Grozny, where Russian troops
and Chechen rebels engaged in fierce street-to-street fighting in
the earlier war.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people died in the 1994-96 war, mainly
civilians caught in saturation bombing by Russian planes and
artillery. Unlike NATO, Russia's poorly financed military does not
possess a significant arsenal of ``smart'' weapons designed to
precisely target and thus reduce the chances for error.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow last week, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signaled that
the current operation to carve out a security zone in Chechnya
could become a longer campaign. Putin said the army's aim would be
``the total destruction of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insist that their planes and artillery are
targeting only sites that could be useful to the separatist
guerrillas of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But eyewitness accounts of refugees tell a different story.
While casualty figures are impossible to determine independently,
it appears that civilians are suffering greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Zura Tutayeva, 45, piled her family along with four others into
an old bus and fled the capital Grozny last week after they said
Russian jets bombed five houses and a mosque in their neighborhood.
Five civilians were killed, she said, and no fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our kids out of school and don't know where we're
going,'' she said as they crossed into Ingushetia. ``We don't know
where we'll live or who will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   A videotape obtained last week by Reuters Television appeared to
support the claims of Chechen officials that Russian forces bombed
a road in northern Chechnya and hit a bus full of refugees, killing
41. Russian authorities have denied any knowledge or responsibility
for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel spokesman also said Friday that Russian planes had
bombed the village of Elistanzhe in southeast Chechnya, near the
border with Dagestan, on Thursday and that 32 people died.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Ingushetia, where most of the nearly 150,000
refugees leaving Chechnya have fled, warned Friday that the region
was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The republic is simply suffocating,'' Ruslan Aushev, the
Ingush president told the Interfax news agency. ``We have an acute
shortage of food, baby food, warm clothes, blankets, and even more
important _ tents, trailers and stoves. If the situation does not
change, people will have to spend the winter out in the open,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While insurrectionist guerrillas won the war in 1996, forcing
Russia into a humiliating withdrawal of its troops, there is not
widespread support for the ruling warlords.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, who won election in 1997 in
what international monitors regarded as a relatively fair ballot,
has been unable to halt the lawlessness and turmoil in Chechnya by
competing bands of guerrillas and criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Many refugees blame guerrilla leader Shamil Basayev, a veteran
of the 1994-96 war, for provoking this fight by crossing into
neighboring Dagestan with a band of fighters in August to foment an
Islamic-inspired rebellion there.
</P>
<P>
   But the harshness of the Russian response serves only to rally
support for him and other warlords, said many refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one percent of the people support Basayev and the
guerrillas. But when Russia is making war on us, everyone supports
Basayev,'' said a driver named Abdullah, 35, from the city of
Urus-Martan. He was afraid to reveal his last name.
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov has long sought to open talks with the Kremlin. Yet
while Russia signed a peace accord with Maskhadov and Chechnya
claimed independence when Russian troops withdrew, Moscow has
maintained that the republic remains part of the Russian
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, Putin declared Maskhadov's government to be
illegitimate and endorsed a Chechen parliament in exile in Moscow,
leading to speculation that if its military campaign succeeds,
Russia will try to install a puppet government in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Russian's actions to resolve the Chechnya problem
will hurt more than help, analysts warn. Occupying one third of
Chechnya may make Russia more secure in the short term, but be more
deadly for Russian troops in the long run _and make a full-scale
invasion more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense perimeter (for Russia) may be 20 percent shorter,
but Russia's enemies in the region have now increased tenfold,''
said Pavel Felgenhauer, an independent defense analyst in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quagmire the Russian government said it wants to avoid
seems all set,'' he added.

`HARSH REALM': HARD TO CONQUER, BUT WORTH A SECOND LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Carter has never been easy on his audience. The creator of
``The X-Files'' and the late, bizarre ``Millennium'' is a master of
wild turns in plot, daring viewers to try to keep up with him, let
alone guess ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is at it again. Now comes ``Harsh Realm,'' a Byzantine
mind game that after the first episode Friday night will leave you
confused but intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, just what Carter fans want.
</P>
<P>
   But is it really worth the intellectually masochistic
satisfaction? To be honest, I don't know yet, since I haven't
exactly figured out this Fox fantasy drama. But it did get better,
and a lot more focused in my mind, when I watched a tape of the
pilot a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Thomas Hobbes (Scott Bairstow), an American Army hero in a
1994 Sarajevo skirmish, is a short-timer in 1999, getting ready to
leave the military and move from New Jersey to California with his
fiancee, Sophie (Samantha Mathis). But he is unexpectedly called in
by a superior (Lance Henrickson of ``Millennium'' in a cameo) to
play what the officer calls a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harsh Realm ... It's a simulated war game, a virtual-reality
game used to teach situational war strategy,'' the officer tells
the less-than-philosophical Hobbes. ``The Pentagon developed it,
kept it under wraps. We got it on line looking for a crackerjack
soldier who can beat our high score: Sergeant Major Omar
Santiago.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the game is more than a game _ it can affect our
real world _ and Santiago (Terry O'Quinn of ``Millennium and ``The
X-Files'' movie) has hijacked the alternate reality and created the
military junta that rules it. Dozens of soldiers have been sent
``into'' the game to ``take out'' _ that is, kill _ Santiago, a
retired soldier who was the most decorated combat veteran in
Southeast Asia and now is reigning Lord of the Realm.
</P>
<P>
   So who else is in the game? Us _ at least copies of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the 1990 Census, satellite cartography and other
classified data, the creators of Harsh Realm have simulated a
virtual reality, where landscapes and people are identical to our
world, down to every man, woman and child,'' an offscreen narrator
(Gillian Anderson, uncredited) in a video tells Hobbes before he
unwittingly is sent into the game. What he finds is another world
populated by ``copies'' _ and other soldiers and mercenaries sent
in before him to kill Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Question: If the game copied everybody, and you are sent in to
take out Santiago, wouldn't there then be two of you? (See what I
mean?) By the way, if you die in the game, you die in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Now does everybody understand this show based on a comic book?
Don't worry, it even took one of the stars some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much understood the show when I read it, but I had a
hard time visualizing it,'' O'Quinn said. ``I'm kind of computer
illiterate. So I had a tough time seeing it. The fact that Carter
is doing it is a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   But will the audience get it? ``I guess there is some concern,''
O'Quinn said. ``There might be some things if you miss the first
one you won't know what is going on. They are going to have to find
a good one- or two-minute intro that explains things.''
</P>
<P>
   Or you can watch it twice. It works.

`RANDOM HEARTS' CHARMS BUT HAS TOO LITTLE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mood for a big, glossy, super-star-wattage Hollywood
romance that goes ... nowhere? If so, you'll be glad to learn of
``Random Hearts,'' a sleek zero of a movie that asks whether two
gorgeous people can get it on.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, of course, yes. But we knew that. We also knew
that Harrison Ford can carry anything, and we don't mean Samsonite.
This helps, considering that his chemistry with the fascinating but
cool Kristin Scott Thomas fails to spark firestorms of desire, and
that Sydney Pollack's direction runs at two speeds, slow and stop.
</P>
<P>
   When something happens to kick the thing into gear _ i.e., when
one character assaults and/or emphatically kisses another _ the
effect is altogether jarring, like waking from an afternoon nap to
the sound of a car horn.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Ford plays ``Dutch'' Van Den Broeck, a Washington,
D.C., internal-affairs cop whose wife, Peyton (Susanna Thompson),
goes down in a Boeing 737 bound for Miami. In the same crash dies
Cullen Chandler (Peter Coyote), husband of Kay Chandler (Thomas), a
New Hampshire politico who's running for Congress. Kay and Dutch
are initially unaware that their spouses have died, because _ as
fate and infidelity would have it _ Kay and Dutch don't know that
their respective spouses were heading to Florida for a little
hanky-panky by the beach.
</P>
<P>
   When the news hits, nobody cries. Nobody collapses. Nobody
heaves shuddering sobs of grief. Instead, Dutch's response to his
wife's death is to become obsessed with her adultery, tracking down
information on the couple's hotel, their trysts, their love nest.
</P>
<P>
   In his pursuit he ticks off Kay, who just Vants To Be Alone, at
least until she changes her mind about Dutch and starts necking
with him violently in an airport parking lot. And so it goes: The
gorgeous people get it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' is lovely to look at, and it boasts a few nice
character turns (from Charles S. Dutton and Pollack himself), but
the film suffers from a fatal lack of plot. Nothing much happens.
Despite Dutch's investigation, we never learn anything substantive
about the cheating spouses. How did they meet? How long had they
been fooling around? Was some vast governmental conspiracy behind
their affair? Were they drug-runners? Terrorists? Cuban
nationalists? Time-travelers?
</P>
<P>
   Based on a novel by Warren Adler, ``Random Hearts'' splits its
writing chores between Darryl Ponicsan (``Murder in the First,''
``School Ties''), who gets credit for the adaptation, and Kurt
Luedtke (``Out of Africa,'' ``Absence of Malice,'' both Pollack
pictures), who gets credit for the screenplay. The fine points of
such divisions of labor are probably lost on anyone outside
Hollywood, but the results are the same: a plot that droops, a
subplot (involving a corrupt cop) that's more interesting than the
central romance, and dialogue that trades in hesitant aphorisms.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's last directing effort was his unfairly maligned remake
of ``Sabrina,'' in which Harrison Ford made a good-faith effort at
playing Humphrey Bogart to Julia Ormond's Audrey Hepburn. In that
film, at least, a gaping age difference stood between the comely
couple and a happy future; in this one, nothing stands between them
beyond a pair of adulterous dead spouses (who are never properly
mourned, anyway) and a desire to duck some really nasty gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's an election year. Kay has that congressional seat
to consider.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Random Hearts'' charms, and it does here and there, it's
invariably thanks to Ford's worn-in charisma _ a reassuring mix of
vulnerability and take-charge, buckwheat guyness. Ford's best
scenes are at the start of the film, as Dutch fumblingly learns of
his wife's death and infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Van Den Broeck, I don't think you should be alone right
now,'' says a solicitous airline official who visits Dutch's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?'' Dutch snaps. ``I was alone when you got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who sports a near-perfect American accent, brings her
crisp, authoritative presence to the film but never quite explodes
with Ford the way she did with Robert Redford in ``The Horse
Whisperer.'' There's no danger here _ no suspense, no nagging doubt
about the fate of Kay and Dutch. We assume all along that they'll
follow the tale to its end. The question is, will we?

GIULIANI MAKES EXHIBIT A SENSATIONAL HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL LUCIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Sunday, as we rode down Broadway on our way to
the ``Sensation'' exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the
cabdriver warned us of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to go yesterday, but the line of people was out in
the street,'' he said. He suggested we visit the botanical gardens
next door to the museum instead. ``I'll go see it in December,'' he
said of the controversial show.
</P>
<P>
   We disregarded the advice and took the subway to Brooklyn, which
was complicated a little by the fact that the stop right in front
of the museum was closed. After a three- or four-block walk, we
came to a line of people maybe 1,000 strong stretching the length
of the museum, along the sidewalk and almost into the street.
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned protest signs lay on the lawn, and the police made
their presence apparent, as about 20 officers milled around in
small groups in front of the building.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting line was surprisingly diverse, ranging from families
with young children, to turtleneck-clad artists, to the elderly
most lured, like my classmate and me, by the media frenzy. The
mellow crowd outside buzzed with conversation about the
circumstances surrounding the show inside.
</P>
<P>
   One teen-age girl, seething with pseudo-intellectual comments,
asked a cop, ``What do you think of the whole Giuliani thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a public servant. I have no opinion,'' he replied, before
going after a woman trying to scalp a ticket. (Ticketholders were
admitted immediately, skipping the line.)
</P>
<P>
   After a week of religious outcries, repeated condemnations by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and inescapable hype about elephant dung on
religious icons, a classmate and I had headed to New York to see
what all the squabbling was about.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour, we finally made our way inside, and once we
passed through the metal detector and the bag check we joined the
ticket line, where we waited 10 more minutes to gladly pay our
$9.75 admission and at last enter ``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   The saga did not end there.
</P>
<P>
   It continued with an overflowing elevator ride and another line
on the fifth floor. Then, right when I was beginning to feel that
the process was more difficult than applying to college, we entered
the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident that the crowd of about 5,000 lacked serious art
viewers; many visitors wandered aimlessly, glancing quickly at a
piece before moving on, often appearing bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm an art critic. My museum experience includes only
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, also in New York, and the
Smithsonian, in Washington. I was, however, finding ``Sensation''
interesting and educational, regardless of the fact that some of
the work was rather unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one artist used mannequins _ some dismembered and
hanging from trees. Another work portrayed children with genitals
on their faces. It was bizarre, and I could see why some might find
it disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the works that I found fascinating was a fiberglass male
face, about 5 feet tall and 4 feet wide. The artist had paid an
amazing amount of attention to detail. Every eyelash and nose hair
was strategically placed. The face had blemishes, there was a
little wax in the ears, and there was an expression in the eyes
that seemed to stare right through you. We moved on, doing our best
to interpret and react to each work. And finally we encountered the
reason we came, ``The Holy Virgin Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christopher Ofili painting at the heart of the controversy
clung to the wall, protected by a plate of clear plastic and two
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   We slipped through a crowd of about 20 people surrounding it to
get a close look. I stood there, almost wanting to laugh. If the
cartoonish image did not have the words ``Virgin Mary'' under it,
the average passer-by probably never would have figured out that it
was supposed to be her. A lacquered piece of elephant dung covered
one breast, and photographic cutouts of buttocks that looked like
wings surrounded the image.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, we escaped the group of onlookers and took in
the rest of ``Sensation.'' Ofili, who painted ``Mary,'' had three
other paintings in the show, two of which involved elephant dung.
Not to say that the paintings looked crappy _ they actually were
very intricate, and more intriguing than the work that had caused
the ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the exhibit, I'm inclined to continue believing
that the First Amendment is superior to the opinion of a mayor. But
maybe they should change the name of the show to
``Sensationalized,'' because that's what it seemed to have become.
Only Giuliani could provoke so many people to pay 10 bucks to see
elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I'd like to thank the mayor for enticing me to go see
an interesting art show. I'm sure the people who run the museum
would like to thank him, too, for such wonderful free advertising.

NASA PROBES MEETING OF SCIENTISTS, EXECS AND UFO ENTHUSIAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An upcoming private meeting between Silicon
Valley high-tech executives, NASA scientists and a high-profile UFO
enthusiast has sparked an investigation by a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   Special Agent Keith Tate, an investigator with the Long Beach
branch of NASA's Office of Inspector General, has been calling
Silicon Valley sources, including the San Francisco Examiner,
seeking information about a planned meeting next Tuesday between
research scientists and Silicon Valley high-tech executives.
</P>
<P>
   At that meeting, first reported by the Examiner, attendees,
including scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.,
will discuss propulsion technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine if any proprietary information will
be talked about at that meeting,'' said Tate. ``We're very
concerned about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Staging the meeting will be the International Space Sciences
Organization. Its founder is Joe Firmage, a 28-year-old, high-tech
executive who made headlines late last year when he published a Web
site and book in which he recounted his beliefs in space aliens. On
the ISSO site, he claims to have been visited in his bedroom one
night by such an alien.
</P>
<P>
   Firmage also has stated that some of the high technology of
today was obtained from the legendary alien space craft crash that
allegedly occurred in Roswell, N.M., in 1947. Firmage stepped down
from his post as CEO of the giant Santa Clara-based USWeb Internet
consulting firm following his revelations because of shareholder
concerns about his extra-terrestrial pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   An ISSO spokesman had no comment on the NASA probe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, NASA has been researching an array
of exotic propulsion technologies through a small program dubbed
Breakthrough Propulsion Physics.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these techniques thumb their noses at Albert Einstein's
theory of relativity, which postulates that nothing can travel
faster than the speed of light _ 186,000 miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   These include using technologies familiar to science fiction
fans: worm holes and warp drives.
</P>
<P>
   Firmage, according to his Web site, says that ``there is
stunningly good evidence that UFOs are real starships.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes that ``whatever did or did not happen at Roswell in
1947 will ultimately prove to be a rounding error when the
implications of this phenomenon become widely known.''

DISORIENTED DEER DROP IN ON WOMAN FOR NIGHTTIME VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was sort of a macabre wildlife marriage of
``Animal Farm'' and ``The Night Before Christmas'' and it has
changed Maggie Clark's whole way of looking at her friendly
neighborhood deer.
</P>
<P>
   While others in Clark's area have been building higher and
higher fences to keep out deer, she's been feeding them and naming
them. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 47, a business calendar saleswoman, was watching ``Animal
Farm,'' based on the George Orwell novel about animals revolting
against humans, last Sunday night when on her rooftop, she heard
such a clatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this big crashing noise outside my bedroom window and
I assume it's the big bucks who are always hanging out in this
neighborhood and crashing into things,'' she said. ``Two minutes
later, my whole house starts shaking. I'm freaking out, thinking,
`My God, they're ramming my front door.'''
</P>
<P>
   Telling a friend who had just called that she'd better check
things out, Clark said, ``I looked out the door into the hallway
and they're walking toward me. They could've been ambling, they
could've been charging. I don't remember. I screamed and slammed
the door shut. My friend, of course, thinks I'm being murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   The deer, both male, one older and one younger, apparently had
jumped from a hill onto her ranch home's roof, then tumbled through
latticework over the patio and, panicked, tore through a screen
door into the house.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Clark's screams alarmed the beasts. The bigger one
fled back outside. ``He had to turn his entire head sideways to get
his rack out of my now-torn up screen door,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   But the other dashed into the living room. ``He's going berserk,
freaking out,'' Clark said. Although she said Thursday that there
are still hoof marks all over, the frantic buck miraculously
avoided breaking any wine glasses, a huge glass cocktail table or
several plate glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   During the mayhem, Clark was able to call 911. As the frenzied
deer dashed to the other end of the house, the 911 dispatcher kept
yelling, ``Are you OK? Are you OK?'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The animal went down to her office, Clark added, ``tearing
things up. (But) he didn't go near my computers. Actually, he was a
very careful deer for (being) as frantic as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, police arrived and, after assessing the scene in
amazement, they coaxed the deer back outside.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rampage, Clark said damage to her house wasn't all
that much _ maybe $500 _ but she's looking at deer differently
these days.

UNDERMANNED TEAM MISSING WHAT IT TAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Every player who entered the clubhouse saw the
pictures Thursday. They were framed, hanging eerily on the walls of
the Red Sox' temporary quarters at Jacobs Field. To the left: An
advertisement for ``Field of Dreams'' _ autographed by Kevin
Costner. To the right: An ad for ``Angels in the Outfield'' _
accompanied by the appropriate disclaimer: You gotta believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox saw that prophetic artwork as they trudged the route
from their showers to their lockers. Talk of angels and dreams is
perfect for them because it is obvious that they need to rely more
on the spiritual, magical, and mystical rather than the physical.
To paraphrase Jack Nicholson, they can't handle the physical. And
it's not entirely their fault. In two Division Series games here,
this is what happened when the Sox tried to be physical: Indians
14, Sox 3. They tried Thursday and lost, 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after walking by those photos, Sox reliever Derek Lowe
was asked about the team's fans. He was asked if he thinks anyone
has abandoned the Sox and opted to leap from a local bridge
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not have jumped yet,'' Lowe said, ``but they may be
hanging on by an arm.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who already jumped? It's too bad, because they
missed the point. The Sox do not trail their best-of-five series
because they choked or were haunted by ancient Curses. They are on
the verge of losing to the Indians for the third time in five years
because the entire organization hasn't learned what it takes to win
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that includes the players. Bret Saberhagen, a man who
walked 11 batters all year, walked three in the third inning
Thursday. The day before, John Valentin could have thrown out Manny
Ramirez and gotten Lowe out of the sixth inning. His throw was low.
The next batter, Jim Thome, hit a home run that tied the game.
There have been errors, bad at-bats, and bad pitching. But
regardless of what happens in the next three days, Dan Duquette and
his staff will have to upgrade their off-the-field plans in the
offseason, which could start as soon as Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox general manager has shown that he knows how to take a
couple premium materials, combine them with random discarded parts,
and produce a playoff team. No one can question Duquette's ability
to get his team there. He should be given props for that,
especially since many GMs are fired before ever assembling a
playoff team. But the next step is to produce a team that can win
in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has played Cleveland in the playoffs nine times since
1995, winning only once. The Sox may be able to handle the powerful
Tribe in the regular season, when teams don't nitpick nearly as
much as they do in the playoffs. So it's not that the Indians know
something the Sox don't. It's just that they have the ability to do
something the Sox can't: They can be physical any time they want.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, after all the talk of mistakes and errors and bad
pitching, we should come to the conclusion that the Indians are
simply the better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll say that,'' Valentin said. ``They have a
lot of talent over there. A whole lot of talent. When they play
well, it is hard to beat them. But we've got a plan of how we like
to do things. And if we follow it, we should win. But sometimes you
can follow it and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, that is the major difference between the Indians and the
Sox. One team leans on its abundance of talent; the other leans on
its strategy. When the venue is a classroom, the intellectuals can
beat out the brutes. But when you are trying to go to the World
Series, the men with the most muscle usually win. The Sox can still
win this series and advance to the American League Championship
Series. Here's the only condition: They can't make any mistakes. No
matter what your profession, that's a terrible way to live.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Sox catcher Jason Varitek sat in a clubhouse chair and
talked about the mistakes he thought he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I made a bad pitch selection to (Harold) Baines,'' the
catcher said. With the Indians leading, 3-1, in the third, Baines
hit a three-run homer that secured the win. ``We can't let Harold
beat us there,'' Varitek said. ``I probably should have gone to the
mound and slowed the pace of the game. That's what I mean by a bad
selection. I'll take the blame there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mentioned to Varitek that since the Division Series
format began in '95, only one team _ the Mariners _ has come back
to win after being down 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why there is history,'' he replied. ``And that's why
they keep records.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question the Sox have been enjoyable to watch this
season. In the bloated stat world known as the American League, the
Sox actually won with decent pitching and by perfecting
hit-and-runs. But there are reasons that many fans will feel more
like Sox pallbearers when they attend Saturday's game. They
understand that the players, coaches, and manager maximized what
they had. They also understand it is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how Duquette becomes part of this. He needs to
acquire more premium parts. The Indians are Saks Fifth Avenue. The
Sox are T.J. Maxx. This has to change. If not, the playoff results
will remain the same.

BCS REMAINS AN INEXACT SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of you probably think the coaches' and writers' polls
decide the front-runners for the Bowl Championship Series title
game in the Sugar Bowl Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   This logic would suggest that Florida State and Penn State are
in line for New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Think again. As part of the BCS selection process, eight
computer rankings will be a factor _ along with the two major
polls, team record, and strength of schedule _ ranging from the
popular Sagarin and Dunkel rankings to the obscure Billingsley and
Rothman rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State is No. 1 in only three rankings _ Dunkel,
Billingsley, and Sagarin.
</P>
<P>
   In the California-based Rothman rankings, Penn State is ranked
just 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Even more startling is the top five of the Rothman rankings: 1.
Virginia Tech, 2. Marshall, 3. Florida State, 4. Clemson, and 5.
Nebraska. Also ahead of Penn State are Virginia, Minnesota,
Mississippi State, and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   We are in the no-harm, no-foul stage of the season, with the
first BCS ranking scheduled to be released at the end of the month,
but please. How in the name of Bear Bryant can anyone take this
process seriously if a ranking as off-base as the Rothman is
considered?
</P>
<P>
   Using those rankings as the definitive measuring stick, we would
have a national championship game of Virginia Tech vs. Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Rothman rankings, Penn State and Tennessee would fight
for the last spot in a 16-team playoff format.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the criticism of the BCS last year was that there were
too few rankings with too much weight. Now it appears eight is more
than enough, but in a negative way.
</P>
<P>
   All of this goes back to the issue of having a playoff system to
decide a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was formed to preserve the bowl system but also to
implement a formula to decide who would play in a rotating national
championship bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   What was flawed last season _ and what appears to be flawed this
season _ is the method of selecting which teams get to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   As subjective as the coaches' and writers' polls are, they still
involve humans making decisions based on what they see and feel.
</P>
<P>
   With these computers, one wonders about the mind-set of the
programmers. The Rothman rankings list 1-AA Troy State at 44th,
ahead of Auburn and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   The eight computerized rankings count for one-fourth of the
total of the BCS rankings, which will determine the No. 1 and No. 2
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was criticized last year, so the system was ``tweaked,''
as BCS chairman Roy Kramer put it.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through a season which has yet to take a defining turn,
the system may need to be tweaked again.

   It's not too early to start talking about Boston College's bowl
chances. Two more wins _ probably against Temple and Pittsburgh _
get the Eagles a bowl game in Hawaii. Three more will get them to
the Music City Bowl in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East has arrangements for three BCS slots: the Gator
Bowl, the Insight.com Bowl, and the Music City Bowl. The X-factor
is Notre Dame. If the Irish qualify for a bowl bid, the last
bowl-eligible Big East team will be displaced, and that could be
BC.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish can't go back to the Gator Bowl this season (they were
there last season), but they could take the slot in the Music City
or Insight.com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With three early-season losses and Tennessee, USC, Arizona
State, Stanford, and BC still on the schedule, the Irish need to
win five of their last seven (they play 12 games this season) to
qualify with a 7-5 mark.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Top 25-bound?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of BC, the Eagles are one of the 13 unbeaten Division
1-A teams. The other 12 are ranked in the Top 25 . . . Rutgers
coach Terry Shea is winless in odd-numbered years. Shea took over
in 1997, a winless season, won five games last year, and is 0-4
this season . . . The Florida State situation involving wide
receivers Peter Warrick and Laveranues Coles, in which more than
$200 worth of merchandise allegedly was purchased at a department
store in Tallahassee while less than $25 was rung up on the cash
register by a friendly clerk, drew this response from Warrick, who
felt the whole thing was blown out of proportion by the media.
``It's not like I killed the president,'' he said. It will be
interesting to see if Warrick's Heisman Trophy chances are
affected. So far he is the leading contender, with Georgia Tech's
Joe Hamilton a close second, followed by Alabama running back Shaun
Alexander, Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne, and Purdue QB Drew
Brees . . . There's turmoil at Alabama as well, where several
players and administrators had speeding tickets fixed. ``What's the
big deal?'' asked coach Mike Dubose. When you are a coach who is
under siege, as he is, any turmoil isn't good . . . Auburn punter
Damon Duval had words with coach Tom Tuberville during last week's
loss to Tennessee after Duval's pass on a fake punt was overthrown.
No big deal, but they were shown on national television and when
the redshirt freshman was sent to the locker room by Tuberville to
cool off, the cameras picked up Duval flashing a smile and a peace
sign. That did it. Duval is no longer the Tigers' No. 1 punter.
``We don't condone that type of behavior,'' said Tuberville . . .
Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez had knee replacement surgery this
week and is recuperating at the Mayo Clinic. That won't slow
Alvarez, however. He will watch the Badgers' game against Minnesota
on a big-screen television and have a phone hookup to the sidelines
. . . Florida State coach Bobby Bowden signed a five-year contract
extension. The reason it was announced in midseason was that other
schools were using Bowden's age (he turns 70 next month) against
him in recruiting battles . . . One of the better turnarounds of
the season has been Hawaii's 4-1 start under new coach June Jones.
In recent years, the Rainbows have ranked as one of the worst teams
in Division 1-A, but Jones has watched his team roll to four
straight wins after a season-opening loss to Southern Cal . . .
Watch out for East Carolina. If they get past Southern Mississippi
Saturday, the Pirates could go 11-0 . . . Fans are in an uproar in
Columbus, Ohio, because Ohio State had the audacity to lose two of
its first five games. Could this truly be a rebuilding year for
coach John Cooper, who has lost enough pro prospects in the past
three years to supply a legitimate NFL franchise? . . . Virginia
Tech plays winless Rutgers Saturday, which is bad enough for the
Scarlet Knights. But the Hokies have also won 21 of their last 27
road games.

SINGLE WOMAN, 67, SHOULD USE NESTEGG TO REDUCE MORTGAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a single woman, 67 years old. I have $55,000 in a money
market account, $25,000 in a CD maturing in December, $13,000 in an
IRA maturing this month, and $7,000 in a checking account. My
monthly income from Social Security and retirement is $1,650, and I
am able to save $200 to $300 of this. I have a $75,000 mortgage on
my condo and no other bills. I also have $3,000 in Vanguard Windsor
II fund, and a $6,500 stock portfolio, which has lost $600 at this
time. Id like to be able to leave my daughter as much as possible.
Can you suggest some relatively safe funds, bonds, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., La Jolla, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, since you now have more than 90 percent of your money
invested in absolutely secure instruments such as the money market,
CD, and other bank accounts, Im going to assume that your appetite
for risk is pretty limited.
</P>
<P>
   It strikes me that you are probably paying more in interest on
your mortgage than most of your investments are earning, so it
might make sense to use some of your current nest egg to prepay the
mortgage, and subsequently to add whatever you are able to save to
your mortgage payments. This will increase the net worth of your
estate at a more rapid rate than adding funds to the money market
or CD accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Heres what I suggest. If the money market account is with a bank
rather than a mutual fund, transfer $20,000 of that money to a
mutual fund money market account, which will probably pay about
twice as much as most banks do on their money market accounts. Ill
suggest Vanguards Prime Money Market fund, since you already have
an account there and its easiest to keep all your fund holdings
within one family.
</P>
<P>
   Id then move $20,000 of the money market account to Vanguard
GNMA fund, which invests in government-guaranteed mortgage
securities and should bring you a yield in the 6.5 percent range.
But read the prospectus and annual report carefully before you do
this, because over short time periods this and other GNMA funds can
be quite volatile. This is a good investment only when held for the
long run, in which the upswings and downturns (caused by changes in
interest rate climates) tend to cancel each other out. Look
carefully at performance figures over the last decade, and youll
see the short-term volatility I describe; if youre uncomfortable
with this risk, or if you feel you might have to call upon these
funds in an emergency, this is not a good fund for you.
</P>
<P>
   Id then move $5,000 of the money market cash to Vanguard Star
fund, which is a conservative balanced fund, dividing its assets
between stock and bond holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I would use the remaining $10,000 from the money market
account balance to prepay the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are comfortable with that strategy and if you feel that
having $20,000 in the money market fund plus $7,000 in your
checking account is enough in the way of liquid assets to protect
yourself from emergencies, you might also add the proceeds of the
CD that matures this month to the mortgage prepayment. If you feel
that having more money in liquid accounts is best, you could simply
roll the CD over into a new issue. Or you could roll over some of
the money into a new CD and use the remainder to add to the
mortgage prepayment.
</P>
<P>
   I think these moves would have the effect of increasing the
potential for growth within your savings, without dramatically
increasing the risk level.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 29 and 27 years old respectively, with
no plans to have children. Our current savings consist of $15,500
in a Roth IRA account invested in Putnam Voyager fund, Class B.,
and my 401(k) plan now worth $27,000 evenly divided among Fidelity
Blue Chip Growth, Fidelity Fund, Fidelity Magellan and Fidelity
Contrafund. We also have $2,000 each in Invesco Financial Services,
Invesco Health Services, and my companys stock. We have $4,000 each
in SIT Large Cap, Janus Worldwide, and Fidelity Cash Reserves
funds. Finally, we have $6,500 in Fidelity Equity Income II fund. I
contribute $500 a month to my 401(k) and $200 a month to my
companys stock purchase plan. My husband will begin contributing
$200 a month to his companys 401(k) plan once he becomes eligible
in a few months. Our current debt and obligations consists of two
car payments and rent. Our investment goals are to purchase a home
in the next three to five years and retirement. Do you have any
suggestions on our current portfolio to help us meet our goals?
</P>
<P>
   N.H., Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think youre doing reasonably well with your retirement
portfolio, although a little more diversification away from the
large-cap stocks would doubtless help in the long run. But for the
life of me, aside from the $4,000 money market account, I cant find
the savings for your anticipated purchase of a new home. Since all
of your ongoing savings are going into either tax-deferred accounts
or your companys stock, Im going to presume that you are thinking
of the $18,500 which is in stock mutual fund accounts, plus the
money market position, as the source of your down payment. To my
thinking none of the stock funds are appropriate for money which
you will likely be calling upon in 36 to 60 months. The stock funds
represent too much risk for such a near-term goal. So my first
suggestion is to decide how much of your total savings is to be
used for the down payment on your first home, and to move that
money to appropriate vehicles, such as the money market fund, CDs,
or perhaps a short-term bond fund at the riskiest. In addition, you
should decide if any of your ongoing savings should be earmarked
for the down payment, and if so to put it in similar vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   As for your retirement accounts, all of the funds yopu hold
concentrate their portfolios in large-cap domestic stocks. I would
begin by looking at the options within your 401(k) program, looking
for attractive offerings in the mid-cap and small-cap arenas, plus
perhaps an international and a health care fund. If there are no
such options available, you could at least achieve some
diversification by moving the money in the Roth IRA to funds in
those categories. Once your husband joins his companys 401(k) plan,
I suggest he make his investment choices with diversification in
mind. My advice would be to look a all the retirement accounts as a
single portfolio, and then to put 50 percent to 60 percent in
domestic large-cap funds, and then to divide the rest, more or less
evenly, among a mid-cap, a small-cap, an international, and a
sector fund. In the latter category, I tend to find health care and
technology the most attractive sectors for long-term growth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why would it not be better for a 75-year-old interested in
income to have a major portion of his portfolio in a Fidelity or
Massachusetts tax-free fund rather than a GNMA?
</P>
<P>
   H.N., Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, in some tax circumstances, it might be advantageous,
but dont think that tax-exempt funds and Ginnie Mae offerings have
no differences beyond their different tax status. As this is
written, Vanguards Massachusetts Tax Exempt fund offers a 5.17
percent yield, and Vanguards GNMA fund offers a 6.84 percent yield.
Certainly somebody in a substantial tax bracket would be better off
with the fund that is free of both federal and state income taxes.
But the tax-free fund -- like most municipals -- holds a long-term
portfolio, in contrast to the intermediate-term holdings of he GNMA
fund. You can see this right away when you look at year-to-date
results for the two funds. This has been a pretty tough year for
bond funds of all stripes, but the 3.73 percent year-to-date loss
for the Vanguard Massachusetts Municipal fund is a long way from
token .18 percent gain for Vanguard GNMA. Whenever you have a
fixed-income fund with a long-term portfolio, the risk level is
greater than that of a fixed-income fund with an intermediate-term
portfolio. In this case, the difference is more than enough to
erase any advantage in yield. And if you went to an
intermediate-term Massachusetts tax-free fund, the yield would
decline accordingly, until the advantage over the GNMA fund would
be erased for all but the wealthiest.

CLEMENS TO REVEAL HIS TRUE STRIPES SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Will the real Roger Clemens step forth? A lot of
people have been asking that since he donned Yankee pinstripes in
February.
</P>
<P>
   With his first postseason start since 1995 a day away, Clemens
is going about his business. Long runs along the nearby parkway.
Exhausting exercises, performed mostly in private at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens flew to Texas Thursday to prepare for his start against
the Rangers in Game 3 of the American League Division Series
Saturday night. ``Too much to do,'' he said in a brief encounter
Thursday. ``Can't talk. Got some people to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   He probably does. Certainly, Clemens is focused on the job at
hand. Now 37, he has become a very private person. To many, he is a
hired gun, even though he had no control over being traded from
Toronto to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was an insurance policy for a team that won 114
regular-season games last year and maintained the best record in
the American League this year. The Yankees have a four-man rotation
that includes David Cone, Orlando Hernandez, and Andy Pettitte. Is
it a sin to have only a 14-10 record for such a squad? If the
Yankees don't repeat, it might be. Yankee manager Joe Torre says he
has four guys who can be No. 1 starters, and for the Division
Series, Clemens fits in well at No. 3. In the next series he might
be No. 2 or No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see Roger bringing to the table is his preparation,''
said Torre. ``Also his history of the number of games he's won and
how dominant he's been. Experience is big with me. For the most
part, Roger's stuff has been good, but his command hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way people are used to describing Roger Clemens.
He has won five Cy Young Awards, none of them as a No. 3 man. This
is a change that happens when you get older.
</P>
<P>
   In his Red Sox days, they talked about his immense pitching
ability and his leadership qualities. As a kid out of the
University of Texas, he was confident on the mound and almost as
skinny as Pedro Martinez. He challenged hitters with his fastballs.
In winning his first three Cy Youngs, he was the pride of New
England and seemed to enjoy the role. But that has changed, and so
has Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens left Boston after posting a 10-13 record in 1996. He
complained about the way he was treated by general manager Dan
Duquette. Even worse, he was stunned by the criticism from Red Sox
fans, who were quick to point out that he was only 40-39 in his
last four seasons in Boston. Even now, just the mention of his name
at Fenway incites the boo-birds.
</P>
<P>
   The trip from Beantown to Toronto was good for Clemens, and it
gave him another chance to win new fans and two more Cy Youngs. But
his frequent barbs at the Blue Jays (specifically the quality of
his teammates) revealed another side. Clemens wanted to leave
Toronto because he felt the organization no longer wanted to win.
Thus he had no trouble with the trade to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was suppose to help both teams while giving Clemens a
change to achieve his only remaining goal _ a World Series ring.
The Blue Jays got David Wells, Homer Bush, and Graeme Lloyd in what
was called the biggest trade since Babe Ruth was acquired from the
Red Sox. Clemens posted a 14-10 record in 30 starts with a 4.60
earned run average. He won't win the Cy Young, but if the Yankees
repeat, no one _ including Clemens _ will care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fit in with the team well,'' said Yankee coach Don Zimmer,
who as a bench coach with the Red Sox in 1992 observed Clemens on a
daily basis. ``I know he would have liked to have a better year
pitching. There were times when he was the real Roger that
everybody knows. There were other times when he struggled. He's
been no different here than he was when I was in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does a lot of work on his own. Lots of times you won't see
him on the field, but it's not because he's not working. The guy
comes out on the bench. He roots for pitchers. He roots for
hitters. There's no problem with Roger. One thing about it, he
gives you what he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre, ``I think a lot of it is we're getting to know each
other. At times we gave him more rest than he was used to having.
Sometimes that's a hinderance to a power pitcher who goes at a
certain rhythm. He likes to be a little tired, maybe. We took a
little edge off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with him the last few days, and he's got his plans
for Game 3 already mapped out. He seems very relaxed. He is very
mindful of what his job is. You just hope he doesn't get too pumped
up. When that happens, he can't control it on the mound. David Cone
has the same problem. He goes out there and all of a sudden you
have your arm trying to catch up, and you're all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre added that Clemens is No. 3 in the rotation by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great as a manager when you have those marquee
pitchers,'' he said. ``Clemens could have pitched No. 1. But again,
I'm big on experience, and David Cone has done so well in the
postseason pitching in the middle of the rotation. Having the two
guys who have the most experience is a big plus for us. You can't
get caught up in all the distractions. What if you don't? What if
you can't? You've got to think in terms of what you're going to do
and not what you can't do.''

THE UPSIDE FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're Al Gore, and you're steamed.
</P>
<P>
   They call you Al Bore. They say you can't do anything right.
Bill Bradley is raising more money, and that's supposed to be
telling. But if you were outraising Bradley, you'd get no credit
for it. Your campaign organization has been staggering, shifting
operations to Nashville from D.C., fumbling out apologies for
campaign chief Tony Coehlo's expense-account shenanigans, on the
defensive as Bradley pulls even or ahead in New Hampshire and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The press is unfriendly to hostile. Bradley refuses debate, and
all those let's-debate-the-issues media types give him a pass.
George W. Bush is raising money as it's never been raised before,
and you hear hardly a word of media criticism about the auction of
influence in the next Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has given you more rein and range than any VP in
history, but not a day goes by someone doesn't dare you to blast
his morals. They taunt you as the inventor of the Internet, and
Clinton as the inventor of sin. Being vice president means always
having to say you're sorry. Sorry we did this; sorry we didn't do
that. You've had it drummed into you that most recent presidents
had to go through purgatory to get to the top: Truman, LBJ, Nixon,
Ford, Bush Sr. All things considered, being veep gives you a leg
up. But Americans have these screwy notions about their presidents.
</P>
<P>
   We want them to be father figure, moral leader, partriotic
patriarch, chief of our civic religion as well as the state, symbol
as well as politicial tactician. So we demean the people who have
come close. Finish second in a presidential election, and there's
no silver medal: you're a loser, to be shunned, shamed, dismissed
as broken goods.
</P>
<P>
   There's a corollary to that; serve as vice president, and you're
a lackey, a boot-licker, a coat-holding, time-serving,
dust-collecting appendage, as useless as an appendix. Until you do
some damage.
</P>
<P>
   Vice presidents regain the respect they lost only when they lay
someone out. Drop a hurt on someone who's asking for it. Demolish a
target. Flatten a foe. But you have to find the right opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Bradley is hot, but Dollar Bill is running the
national race for the first time. If you're Al Gore, you reason
thus: People forget this is my fourth time around the national
track. I'm organized on the ground in every state, not just Iowa
and New Hampshire. I'll roll out Ted Kennedy's endorsement, and
Jeannie Shaheen, the governor of New Hampshire is with me; her
husband's running my New Hampshire campaign. I should collar the
AFL-CIO endorsements shortly. Those people who say endorsements
don't count were oohing-and-ahhing when Pat Moynihan and Bob Kerrey
endorsed Bradley. Well, which is it? They count? Or they don't?
Who'd you rather have? Pat Moynihan or Ted Kennedy? Bob Kerrey or
the AFL-CIO? No contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign has the following problems, none
insurmountable: Typical Democratic voters, who have prospered over
the past seven years, don't want to vote for a loser. They need
some proof you can win. Winning Iowa's caucuses and New Hampshire's
primary will be huge. After New Hampshire, there are 18 primaries
in 30 days. It'll be all over by St. Patrick's Days, in all
likelihood, in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time for anyone to recoup after losing New Hampshire,
except the front-runners in both parties. A Gore and a Bush can
recoup in the South and the industrial states; a Bradley and a
McCain cannot, for all practical purposes, survive losing New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Al Gore, you're licking your chops at the prospect of
debating George W. He's not even the smartest Bush brother; sibling
Jeb, the Florida governor, is supposed to be the brighter one. But
Bradley plays it cute. No debates, he yawns; he's doing fine the
way he's going. Tosses out his health plan, and everybody says,
``Wow, gee, what a detailed health plan!''
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants to get in some body shots in a TV debate: ``So, Bill,
how come you wouldn't support the NATO bombing campaign while we
were at war with Serbia? Couldn't decide which way to jump? If you
want to play with the big boys, buddy, you have to tell us if
you're for or against a war, when we happen to be waging it!
Whatsamatter? Cat got your tongue?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley thinks he can get away with blowing off debates. There's
the end-of-October ``town meeting'' in New Hampshire, otherwise
nothing nailed down before the holidays. And Bradley has some
Massachusetts and New Hampshire money people ramped up to come out
for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is not the establishment candidate for nothing. He's
got support in the South and the West that Bradley does not have.
Gore has the lion's share of the ``super-delegates.'' The Democrats
have a system in which 20 percent of the convention delegates are
governors, mayors, congressmen, office-holders who have ties _
political, financial, or ideological _ with the incumbent regime.
</P>
<P>
   These people understand that Clinton is going to be in office
for another 15 months, with Gore right next to him. This means that
Bradley has to run the equivalent of four laps around the track,
and Gore needs to run only about three. Without a single voter
being polled, the Gore campaign may already have close to one-third
of the delegates needed to nominate.

 &HT;    EVEN FOR LOTTERY WINNERS, DEATH AND TAXES UNAVOIDABLE
 &HT;    By JERRY MOSKAL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Life for Gladys J. Cook was a gamble that finally
paid off big _ really, really big. On July 8, 1995, Cook and and
her sister-in-law Myrtle N. Newby won the Texas Lottery, sharing a
$17 million jackpot to be paid over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the elderly Cleburne, Texas, women did not have much time to
enjoy their multimillionaire status. Cook died Nov. 6, 1995, less
than six months after picking the winning numbers, and Newby died
last year.
</P>
<P>
   And now Cook's winnings are the target of an Internal Revenue
Service claim seeing an additional $1.04 million in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS took aim at a partnership Cook and Newby formed to pool
their winnings and losses from their gambling ventures. Instead of
the $1.52 million that MG Partners Ltd. had said Cook's half-share
was worth, the IRS valued it at $3.22 million if borrowed against
or sold.
</P>
<P>
   But the estate is fighting back. It filed a petition asking the
U.S. Tax Court here to overturn the IRS ruling of deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The petition and Walker Arenson, an Austin tax attorney for the
estate, contended that the IRS valuation was flawed because anyone
buying the estate's share of the remaining winnings would confront
a huge IRS tax bill as well.
</P>
<P>
   Arenson said borrowing against Cook's share was equally
unrealistic, because a lender would probably demand double-digit
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't sell something, then it's not worth what they
claim,'' Arenson said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that in a similar case involving a winner of the
California Lottery, a judge ruled against the IRS. Arenson said he
anticipates similar results in the Cook estate's case.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Thursday, Arenson blamed the IRS tax
assaults for the downturn in lottery revenues realized by the
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people see the big winner in the lottery as the
Internal Revenue Service,'' he said. ``I think that's the reason
the lotteries are falling off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS sees a bunch of money in these cases and is taking the
easy way out,'' Arenson said. ``If the IRS was successful, 75
percent of all lottery prize money would go to the IRS in taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   While Arenson said he did not represent Newby's estate, he
expected that the IRS would also try to collect additional taxes
from it.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS issued its notice of deficiency June 25, and has 60 days
to respond to the estate's Sept. 21 petition. If the IRS and estate
fail to negotiate a settlement, the case could go to trial before a
tax court judge.

SEASON OF PLENTY IN THE NORTH COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURG, N.H. _ Reasons for heading north in the fall are not
hard to list. Just string together ``fish,'' ``mountains,''
``leaves,'' ``air,'' ``rivers,'' ``moose'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   In this northern corner of New Hampshire, just below the Quebec
border, all these items come together to make autumn one of the
best seasons to head for New England's high country. We take them
one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The big season in landlocked salmon came to a statutorial end
Thursday. Month's end also closes out lake fishing in the state,
but not so river and stream fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Also, fishing such ponds as Round Pond and Back Lake (which
qualifies as a pond) narrows the focus a good deal, though if you
hook a salmon in the Connecticut River it must be released.
</P>
<P>
   The trout fishing in the streams, though, is fair game and there
is plenty of river, especially the inlet at First Connecticut Lake
and Second Lake _ both accessed easily from Route 3, which runs
along the west shore. Back Lake lies to the south, with the same
highway running along the east shore. Round Pond is an off-road
trek on Route 3 just after the French Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   This hilly country makes for terrific hiking, largely because
it's so far off the well-worn trails of the White Mountains. And
while the trails through Connecticut Lakes State Forest are not the
highly groomed pathways maintained by the AMC on and around Mount
Washington, they are nevertheless challenging in this hill country,
with treks up Covell Mountain out of Brundege Forest _ across Route
3 from First Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Foliage was no doubt damaged by the remains of Hurricane Floyd
as it stalled in this country for nearly a day with high winds and
heavy rain. But if the foliage is off-peak, the walking and
streamside fishing remain among the best escapes, especially in
early fall before snowshoes become a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire's way north is also a pleasant drive this time of
year, when the roads are free of summer tourists. Travel Route 93
through the White Mountain National Forest, then pick up Route 3 at
Franconia Notch and drive up to Lancaster, where the road picks up
the Connecticut River and stays alongside up to Colebrook.
</P>
<P>
   This is a land of green hills, thick forests, and bright water _
some of the prettiest land in the north even if it lacks the
dramatic heights of the White Mountains. And for moose, the
watchword _ as motorists see often on oversize yellow traffic signs
_ is watch out for the huge brutes. Collisions are numerous. On my
visit this fall, I had driven no more than a quarter-mile past the
warning sign when I saw my first (of many) moose. It was a
youngster about 7 feet tall, shambling along the left lane of Route
3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for moose,'' says fishing guide Leon St.
Onge, ``you won't have to look too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, according to Fish and Game spokesman Mark Latti, even
though the season for trout and salmon closed, there are enough
special regulations to keep the stream and lake fishing going at
least through mid-October, in some cases longer.
</P>
<P>
   The late-summer storms did a number, as many of the streams
upcountry rose and began to churn so wildly that the water became
discolored and the stream beds scoured so that holding fish were
displaced.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing is returning to the western Maine hills around
the Rangeley lakes district, and particularly the Kennebago River,
where ``The Screen'' outlets Rangeley Lake into the Rangeley River.
</P>
<P>
   Here, anglers are still talking about one of the best salmon
seasons in recent memory, and the river and upper dam will remain
open for catch-and-release fly fishing only through October. Lake
fishing is generally closed here.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the hiking in the region is truly of the back
country variety as wilderness prevails between Rangeley and the
Canadian border. The Appalachian Trail comes through the Rangeley
region on its last 40 miles to its terminus on Katahdin, Maine's
mile-high mountain in Baxter State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, for serious hikers, early fall is prime time for
Katahdin, best approached this time of year along the Hunt Trail.
Plan on a full day's hike and pack warm clothes for the possible
change in climate at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the region, check out the South Branch of the
Dead River, which runs between Rangeley and Stratton. The trout
fishing along this stretch is terrific in the pools, and about half
the length of the river, between Saddleback Lake and Flagstaff
Lake, is easily accessible from Route 16.
</P>
<P>
   Jumbo landlocked salmon are still fishable in the Crooked River,
which we also visited last spring when the fishing season was off
at a roar as the warm weather hit in April. Since then, locals
around East Sebago say fish to 10 pounds are possible in the next
two weeks. The special regulation closes the Crooked Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Sebago area, where there are some huge togue in the
lake, though landlock season has closed, there is a special
regulation season open until Nov. 30. Anglers may fish the lake at
Sebago Station with barbless hooks, fly only, catch and release.

NOT MUCH TO TALK ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 11-1 rout of the Red Sox by the Indians wasn't much of a
workout for ESPN's Jon Miller and Joe Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleveland has so many weapons there's not too much you can
do,'' Morgan said after Cleveland's Harold Baines hit a three-run
homer in the bottom of third. ``A team's defense is constantly
under pressure with the Indians lineup. You have to play a perfect
game to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, a Red Sox miscue opened the door
for the opportunistic Indians. Wednesday night's Game 1 saw third
baseman John Valentin blow a routine throw to first. The next
batter, Jim Thome, cranked a two-run homer. At least Morgan was
kind. ``One play doesn't always win or lose a game,'' Morgan said
in Valentin's defense. ``The home run only tied the game. If they
had a little more hitting, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's goat was Jose Offerman, whose failure to turn a
double play helped extend the third, giving Baines the chance to
boost Cleveland's lead to 6-1 and knock Saberhagen out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Offerman makes that play, Saberhagen would have been
pitching from a windup as opposed to a stretch,'' Morgan said.
``The Indians always take advantage of every little mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reporter Rick Sutcliffe sensed Saberhagen's demise earlier
in the third. ``Saberhagen's day is almost over,'' Sutcliffe said,
explaining that he needed 14 pitches to get two outs and required a
total of 37 in the third before finally being pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had the line of the day after John Wasdin came in out of
the bullpen. ``He is coming in one pitch too late,'' Miller said.
``Saberhagen had one of those hellacious innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The good thing about both Miller and Morgan is that they made
their points without making it personal or being nasty. They both
praised Saberhagen and the Red Sox for having remarkable seasons.
Morgan pointed out that Saberhagen hadn't walked a leadoff batter
in 111 innings. But Miller said after the first that Saberhagen had
thrown 20 pitches and that he only had ``85 or 90 in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller pointed out that Saberhagen had had three surgeries on
his shoulder, two on his elbow, and another one on his knee. ``The
only thing that hasn't happened to Saberhagen is that they haven't
named a surgery after him,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan heaped loads of praise on the Indians, particularly Kenny
Lofton, Omar Vizquel, and Roberto Alomar. Morgan said the
acquisition of second baseman Alomar from Baltimore made the
Indians ``almost perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller added that Lofton, Vizquel, and Alomar _ at the top of
the Cleveland order _ are ``all fast, and all get on base all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and Miller also spent time recapping Game 1 and Pedro
Martinez's injury. ESPN showed Martinez throughout the first three
innings, dressed in a wool cap, laughing and joking in the Red Sox
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Fox analyst Tim McCarver, who called Game 1, said in an
interview what everybody knows _ ``the Red Sox are a totally
different team without Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver said Martinez should win both the Cy Young and MVP
awards. ``Everybody knows that Pedro is the most dominant pitcher
in the game and the most important person on the Red Sox team,''
McCarver said, pointing out that other teams, such as the Yankees
and Indians, have a number of solid replacements for their
starters. The Red Sox don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not closing the casket entirely,'' McCarver said before
Thursday's game. ``They've still got games to play. If Ramon
Martinez can give them six strong innings . . .''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver might be the last remaining optimist.

LET'S MAKE PRIVATE EQUITY PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich are different from us in so many ways. One is their
access to the world of private equity.
</P>
<P>
   The democratization of capital markets has come a long way,
advanced most forcefully by the mutual fund industry for decades
now. The more recent efforts by brokerages to chip away little
pieces of some initial public stock offerings for their individual
clients is hardly as impressive in practice, but still another step
in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Private equity remains one of the last corners of the investment
world virtually inaccessible to the average Joe or Jane. Leveraged
buyout firms like Thomas H. Lee Co. and scores of venture capital
firms go to institutions and very wealthy individuals when they
want to raise money for a new fund.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that venture capital is the hot spot of the
equity world these days, funding start-ups that hope to be little
building blocks of the new information age. Some turn out to be
duds, but occasionally one become a public stock blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   This week we wrote about the upcoming IPO from Sycamore Networks
Inc. of Chelmsford, which has the potential to be another hot
telecommunications networking stock right out of the box. Lots of
people called or wrote in vain for tips to achieve the near
impossible: to get a piece of stock at the offering price that is
currently estimated to be $18 to $20 per share.
</P>
<P>
   We have no idea if that will really turn out to be a good deal
or not, but Sycamore's venture capital backers certainly secured
better terms. Existing shareholders, which include company insiders
and venture funds, paid an average of 83 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt private equity, especially venture capital, is
a relatively high-risk proposition. But when we see those
individual investors winning, we usually see very wealthy people
getting even richer.
</P>
<P>
   Good for them, but what about us?
</P>
<P>
   In the city of mutual funds, aren't there a few smart people who
can hurdle the problems (there are lots of them) and open some
private equity doors for the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   There has been progress. So-called funds of funds, which invest
in several private equity pools, are available at brokerages and
trust departments with a $100,000 minimum ante in most cases.
Investors have to have a net worth of at least $1 million to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that a push to get into private equity is a kind
of foolish grab for more big returns in the twilight of a bullish
stock market. Another point of contention: that risk and lack of
liquidity make private equity unsuitable for most public
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   It's true private equity isn't for everyone. Money can be tied
up for years _ a big drawback _ and it's more complicated than your
average mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Our response: So what? Just because private equity isn't for
everyone, why should smaller investors who know what they're buying
get boxed out completely?
</P>
<P>
   If pension funds dedicate small slices of their portfolios to
venture capital, why is it inappropriate in moderation for a 401(k)
plan of someone who will work for another 10 or 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   Seligman Advisors, best known for its technology mutual funds,
raised $580 million in August for a new closed-end fund that comes
closest to the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Seligman New Technologies fund plans to invest up to 35
percent of its money in later-stage venture capital deals. Unlike
most closed-end funds, its shares don't trade on any exchange but
investors can redeem up to 5 percent of their shares per quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which was sold through brokers, required just a
$10,000 minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous appetite for these types of
investments,'' said Steve Hodgdon, president of Seligman Advisors.
``The big issue for us is just capacity'' to invest the money. The
fund's list of shareholders includes lots of investors who put up
just $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hodgdon said Seligman will consider creating another fund, but
not before the original vehicle puts more of its money to work in
venture capital investments.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam Investments in Boston teamed up with Thomas Lee this
summer to jointly prepare private equity investments for
institutions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Maxwell, a Putnam managing director who oversees his
company's relationship with Lee, isn't predicting specific products
for less-than-wealthy investors.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't rule them out either, and emphasized that Putnam's
relationship with brokers who could screen customers for private
equity suitability would be essential.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Investments has made a fortune for itself with its own
in-house venture capital firm. Why can't it find a way to manage a
little venture money for its customers, too?

VEGAS TRIES A FRENCH TWIST, AND IT'S A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 10)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. DOWD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Vegas experience captivates people in a variety
of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some come here to see the bright lights, glittering celebrities
and architectural excesses. Some come here determined to view it as
merely a monument to schlock and glitz and then go home to tell
their friends and neighbors how tacky it all is. Some come here to
get rich quick (a brief list of the successful ones' names
available upon request).
</P>
<P>
   The key element to all that, however, is that they do, indeed,
come here by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   And many stay. Las Vegas is the fastest growing metropolitan
area in the United States. Never mind that half the year
temperatures flirt with or exceed 100 degrees. (The simplest job
here is being a television weather forecaster: ``The three-day
outlook is 100-100-100 daytime, 70-70-70 nighttime, and clear
around the clock.'') And never mind that you are, after all,
sitting in the middle of the desert and the thought keeps running
through your mind that the bazillion gallons of water needed each
day to keep this place alive might disappear suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Take someone like Kemis Dengler. After selling a successful auto
dealership in the Buffalo, N.Y., area, Dengler decided that
escaping the Lake Erie winters was more desirable then sticking
them out. So, two summers ago he and his wife ``retired'' and moved
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our dream place,'' Dengler said. ``The atmosphere, the
lack of snow, the excitement of Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that excitement that finally got to him as more than a
part-time attraction. He got antsy sitting around the house, so
when it was announced that a version of Paris (yes, the city in
France) was going to be built on Las Vegas Boulevard better known
as The Strip, ``I made an appointment with their human resources
people to see what was available.''
</P>
<P>
   His business background eventually landed him the job of manager
of the Eiffel Tower portion of Paris. It was in that capacity that
he was busy running around the new resort complex during the hectic
Labor Day weekend grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   The Strip's latest undertaking cost an estimated $785 million to
create a 3,000-room hotel, a glittering casino, upscale shopping
area, restaurants and scale models of several Parisian landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Mind-boggling as it is, it still is a bit understated by modern
Vegas standards. Right across The Strip from Paris is the Bellagio,
the richly appointed Italian-style complex that opened last year
with a $1.4 billion price tag and a museum full of rare fine art by
Van Gogh, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Cezanne and Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   And since Labor Day of last year, the Mandalay Bay resort has
opened along with expansions and renovations of several older
hotels and new work begun on the likes of the new Aladdin complex.
</P>
<P>
   In all, since midsummer 1998, about 10,000 hotel rooms have been
added to the Vegas panoply, and still the visitors keep coming.
Over the recent Labor Day Weekend, the local Chamber of Commerce
announced a phenomenal 92 percent room occupancy overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the bubble has to burst any day now,'' Dengler
said, ``but I don't see any signs of it. People keep buying or
building houses, businesses keep moving in, casino resort complexes
keep opening up or expanding, jobs are plentiful, attendance is
climbing....''
</P>
<P>
   Dengler kept being interrupted as his earpiece crackled with
messages and questions from his staff of several dozen who
tirelessly roamed around the Tower area of Paris, directing
visitors, running elevators to viewing levels, preparing for the
evening's dinner rush.
</P>
<P>
   Large crowds had been expected for the first weekend of the
town's latest wonder, and even the added human pressure of a
holiday crowd was expected. But at least three times during the
long weekend the city fire marshal's office had to turn back the
throngs flocking to see Paris.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   To even the most jaded, it is something special to see.
</P>
<P>
   Ground was broken in April 1997 for the project, owned by the
Hilton Hotels chain. The original announcement of the project was a
year earlier, when Bally unveiled its plans. But shortly after
that, Hilton purchased Bally, and development plans had to be
re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Themed resort hotel/casino complexes have become the norm here,
and they boast elements of world-class proportion. Since Vegas
broke out of its original concentration around Fremont Street,
several miles north of the current expansion area, and began
stretching its borders with family-oriented attractions as well as
the ubiquitous casinos, we have seen completion of some astounding
projects:
</P>
<P>
   _ New York, New York (2,020 rooms) replicates in scaled-down
size a chunk of the Big Apple skyline complete with Brooklyn
Bridge, Coney Island roller coaster and the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pyramid-shaped Luxor (4,407 rooms) is the world's
third-largest hotel. It is 36 stories high, has a 29
million-cubic-foot atrium (the world's largest), and emits what is
believed to be the world's brightest beam of light, comprising 45
Xenon lights.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Excalibur (4,008 rooms), with its silk and swords
Arthurian-era theme, has just added, incongruously, a
16,000-square-foot Nitro Grill eatery with a pro-wrestling theme.
</P>
<P>
   _ The French Riviera-themed Monte Carlo (3,002 rooms) has the
$27 million Lance Burton Theater built as a permanent home for the
master magician.
</P>
<P>
   _ Treasure Island (2,900 rooms) is best known for its huge
Buccaneer Bay outdoor pirate battles that draw crowds 10-deep every
90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The aforementioned Mandalay Bay (3,700) has a South Seas
atmosphere and an 11-acre sand-and-surf beach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the big noise was Bellagio (3,005 rooms) with its
man-made 12-acre lake and computer-controlled dancing fountains.
It's still heavily visited, but having Paris right across the
street has eased the congestion a bit.
</P>
<P>
   All this action has resulted in a gradual spruce-up of the old
town, centered around Fremont Street. That's the Vegas of the old
Sinatra Rat Pack and the Elvis movies. Many of the old casinos are
gone, and those that stay are being reinvented.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Golden Nugget (which has been awarded a AAA ``Four
Diamond'' designation every year since 1974) still sits as the
queen of Fremont Street. A two-block pedestrian area is now covered
by a metal canopy across which flashes a laser light show every
night, and which in the daytime provides shade for strollers. The
area should be seen, if only for comparison to what's new.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't the only area trying to keep pace with the
competition. Even such established Strip stalwarts as the MGM Grand
Hotel and The Mirage are hard at work updating what doesn't look
outdated.
</P>
<P>
   The MGM, for example, just opened a new indoor lion habitat with
a glass passageway visitors can use to walk through the habitat
while the lions walk above, below and next to them. And The Mirage,
home to Seigfried &AMP; Roy and their famous white tigers, is planning
some upgrades in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Paris' offerings trump it all, however. They include a 50-story
version of the Eiffel Tower, a two-thirds-size replica of the Arc
de Triomphe (the original was built in 1805 to honor soldiers who
fought in the Battle of Austerlitz), plus replicas of the 34-story
Hotel de Ville (the real Paris' city hall), the Paris Opera House,
and the renowned Louvre museum (the original houses the Mona Lisa
and the Venus de Milo).
</P>
<P>
   The Eiffel Tower is, predictably, perhaps the most eye-catching
part of the complex. It is located above the casino, with three
legs poking inside and the fourth outside on Las Vegas Boulevard.
There's a French restaurant on the 11th floor, and an observation
deck on the top floor.
</P>
<P>
   Its construction coincided with the centennial anniversary of
the original, built for the World's Fair to celebrate the 100th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   France is known for many things from epic battles under Napoleon
to epic surrenders in 20th-century wars; for raising gracious
living to an art form to living with the stereotype of endemic
rudeness to Americans; from ... well, you get the idea. But, ahh,
the food. A legitimate stereotype, and Paris has eight _ count 'em,
eight restaurants in the new complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Eiffel Tower Restaurant offers view from 100 feet up. Le
Provencal is an Italian-French restaurant with singing waiters. La
Chine is a Hong Kong-style restaurant. The luxury is sublime.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the moneymaker, the place that subsidizes all
else? The casino.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonne Chance is a fascinating 83,000-square-foot space,
designed to look as if you're strolling the streets of Paris at
twilight assuming the city has suddenly had 2,000 slot machines
plunked down outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   A faux sky, cobblestone pathways, wrought-iron street lamps and
period architecture set the mood. There are more than 100 gaming
tables, plus the slots set among the Tower legs extending through
the ceiling. There also is a special section for high-stakes games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see,'' Dengler pointed out, ``this is not a nickel
slot place. It's for how can I put this? People with more
disposable income than a lot of other places draw.''
</P>
<P>
   You can enter from the street, or from the Vegas version of the
Rue de la Paix and its meandering streets lined with shops, wine
bars, boutiques and restaurants. Again, we have the faux sky
providing a feeling of airiness and all storefronts look as if
they're outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   The Opera House area includes a 1,200-seat theater for nightly
Vegas-style entertainment, but there also are laid-back areas, such
as Le Cabaret Lounge, a bistro with live music, and Napoleon's, a
lush upscale club bar.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. The place isn't finished. A Vegas version of Notre Dame
cathedral is expected to be added to the complex shortly after the
new year begins.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the strong start, as long as the visitors want it
they'll always have Paris.

<HEADLINE>
GIVING EXTRA POINTS TO MINORITIES ON SAT EXAMS IS STILL DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RICK KARLIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Ask J.J. Harvey if he should get extra points on
his SAT score because he's African American and you'll get a
puzzled look followed by a brief show of indignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose idea was that?'' asked the senior at Colonie Central
High School. Automatically adding points to the Scholastic
Assessment Test scores of minority students, Harvey said, would
simply reinforce the stereotype that blacks are poor students.
</P>
<P>
   Said Shontell Smith, another black member of the school's class
of 2000: ``I'd like the extra points but not that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding points for minority or disadvantaged students, though, is
exactly what the Educational Testing Service (ETS), which designs
the SAT, has considered. For more than two years, ETS has been
fine-tuning a formula under which such students in certain
socioeconomic categories could be labeled as ``strivers'' and
qualify for additional points.
</P>
<P>
   It's based on the idea that some disadvantaged students will
score higher than predicted, and those students, because they show
promise, should get a leg up in the college admissions game.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantaged student who scored 1,000 of a possible 1,600
points on the combined math and verbal test, for instance, is
probably scoring about 200 points better than expected, according
to ETS researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the strivers concept, several socioeconomic factors in
addition to race would be plugged into the equation. Variables such
as the education levels of a student's parents and even the number
of books in the student's home could come into play.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strivers concept is only that: a tentative idea that
ETS has put forward. It is not likely to be enacted anytime soon.
The College Board, the association of colleges that hires ETS to
write and score the SATs, quickly rebuffed the idea, saying the
college admissions process is too full of subtleties to be reduced
to a formula.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that ETS has looked at a strivers category
underscores the thorny issue of how college admissions officers
balance measurable academic achievements such as grades and
standardized test scores, against intangible characteristics such
as the drive or motivation that a student needs in order to
overcome barriers to scholastic success.
</P>
<P>
   That's an issue that has become as perennial as the SATs
themselves, which will begin being administered Saturday in
selected schools across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   SATs are a fall ritual for thousands of students, especially in
the eastern states, where the test is used as a yardstick by most
colleges and universities. They are offered several times
throughout the year, with many of the October participants taking
the test again in hopes of raising their scores.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that students may go through the test process twice
speaks to the importance that SATs play in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   There is an entire industry devoted to preparing students for
the test, and some high schools, including Colonie Central, have
developed their own after-school test-prep programs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet guidance counselors like Colonie Central's Jack Cramer
stress that the SATs aren't the only measure of a student. ``I
would pretty much expect that they take into account a student's
background and extenuating circumstances,'' Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Like admissions counselors at most schools, those at Skidmore
College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., recognize that students from
different backgrounds have unique characteristics that can't be
measured with an SAT number, said Mary Lou Bates, who heads the
school's admissions office. ``There's no hard and fast number,''
Bates said when asked if there is an SAT cutoff score for admission
to Skidmore.
</P>
<P>
   The imprecise nature of what SAT scores mean, however, is
precisely the problem with these tests in the first place, critics
say, adding that the strivers concept proves their point.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the issue of strivers marks ``the first time on record a
very senior person at ETS has said a combined score of 1,000 on the
SAT is not always 1,000,'' said Robert Schaeffer, public education
director for Fair Test, a Cambridge, Mass.-based group that is
critical of standardized tests like the SATs.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwick College is one of a handful of schools that will accept
applications without SAT scores, if a student thinks they aren't
reflective of his or her true abilities. About 11 percent of the
roughly 2,000 students seeking admission to the Oneonta, N.Y.-based
school leave out their SAT scores in their applications. Still,
despite those obvious doubts about the SAT's effectiveness,
Hartwick Dean of Admissions Susan Dileno says a strivers category
would at least provide a tool for quantifying socioeconomic
factors. ``From my discussions with other admission colleagues,
there seems to be a real interest in it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, however, Dileno stressed that good admissions
officers will look at a variety of factors, including the rigor of
courses a student takes in high school. Most admissions officers,
she said, are more impressed with tougher courses, such as those on
the honors or advanced-placement levels, than a high SAT score.

DISORIENTED DEER DROP IN ON WOMAN FOR NIGHTTIME VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was sort of a macabre wildlife marriage of
``Animal Farm'' and ``The Night Before Christmas'' and it has
changed Maggie Clark's whole way of looking at her friendly
neighborhood deer.
</P>
<P>
   While others in Clark's area have been building higher and
higher fences to keep out deer, she's been feeding them and naming
them. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 47, a business calendar saleswoman, was watching ``Animal
Farm,'' based on the George Orwell novel about animals revolting
against humans, last Sunday night when on her rooftop, she heard
such a clatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard this big crashing noise outside my bedroom window and
I assume it's the big bucks who are always hanging out in this
neighborhood and crashing into things,'' she said. ``Two minutes
later, my whole house starts shaking. I'm freaking out, thinking,
`My God, they're ramming my front door.'''
</P>
<P>
   Telling a friend who had just called that she'd better check
things out, Clark said, ``I looked out the door into the hallway
and they're walking toward me. They could've been ambling, they
could've been charging. I don't remember. I screamed and slammed
the door shut. My friend, of course, thinks I'm being murdered.''
</P>
<P>
   The deer, both male, one older and one younger, apparently had
jumped from a hill onto her ranch home's roof, then tumbled through
latticework over the patio and, panicked, tore through a screen
door into the house.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Clark's screams alarmed the beasts. The bigger one
fled back outside. ``He had to turn his entire head sideways to get
his rack out of my now-torn up screen door,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   But the other dashed into the living room. ``He's going berserk,
freaking out,'' Clark said. Although she said Thursday that there
are still hoof marks all over, the frantic buck miraculously
avoided breaking any wine glasses, a huge glass cocktail table or
several plate glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   During the mayhem, Clark was able to call 911. As the frenzied
deer dashed to the other end of the house, the 911 dispatcher kept
yelling, ``Are you OK? Are you OK?'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The animal went down to her office, Clark added, ``tearing
things up. (But) he didn't go near my computers. Actually, he was a
very careful deer for (being) as frantic as he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, police arrived and, after assessing the scene in
amazement, they coaxed the deer back outside.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rampage, Clark said damage to her house wasn't all
that much _ maybe $500 _ but she's looking at deer differently
these days.

 &HT;    Hot Hues from Burgundy to scarlet are guaanteed to stop traffic
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fashion-conscious people are seeing red this fall, and it's not
necessarily in their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Red is in. Big time. Whether it's garments or accessories, the
color has become so huge that it's quickly replacing black as the
``must-have'' in the wardrobe department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a millennium thing,'' says Anita Finkelstein,
regional fashion stylist for Women's Wear Daily in Atlanta. ``All
of a sudden, it's a brave new world. Everybody's in this very
celebratory mood, and all this black has gotten way too
depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   People have always worn red, particularly for holidays, intimate
occasions and on sweetheart's day. But these days, red is cool
anywhere, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many hues to choose from, including scarlet, brick
and burgundy, that almost anyone can wear it without looking like a
vixen. Men can pull the look off too, especially with deeper tones
in blazers and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm selling it a lot as a layering piece,'' says Shannon
Marler, owner of Sage Clothing Co. in Dunwoody, Georgia. ``And
we're selling a lot of the burgundy because it's something
different.''

 &HT;    Family business ranks high on 'Forbes' 500
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA _ Based in Wichita, Kan., Koch Industries is the
second-largest privately held company in the United States, after
Cargill. According to a December article in Forbes magazine, it is
a $35 billion business with estimated profits of $700 million. The
company ranks 18th on the Forbes 500, right behind Chevron, Procter
&AMP; Gamble and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   The company's main business is oil and gas. It has refineries in
Corpus Christi, Texas, and near St. Paul, Minn., and is among the
world's largest oil traders. It is also produces chemicals, asphalt
and building materials. Koch Beef Co has 12,000 head of cattle on
450,000 acres. Last year Koch Industries bought Purina Mills Inc.,
which had $1.2 billion in sales of animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries employs 16,000 people worldwide and practices a
philosophy it calls Market Based Management.In contrast to
traditional military style command-and-control management, this
system encourages employees to think like business owners _ with
bonuses that can reach seven figures, according to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes article said all voting stock in the company is held
by two of Fred Koch's four sons _ Charles of Wichita, the company's
chairman and CEO, and David of Palm Beach, its executive vice
president _ and by Houston investor E. Pierce Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries was founded by Fred C. Koch, who, in the 1920s,
invented a process for increasing the amount of gasoline that could
be extracted from crude oil. Refiners with competing technologies
filed 40 suits against him alleging patent infringement. Although
he won them all, he could not do business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the Soviet Union, where he helped modernize 15
refineries _ and witnessed Stalin's purges, in which several
Russians he had worked with were killed.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the United States a staunch anti-communist and
became a founding member of the John Birch Society. He founded the
Rock Island Oil and Refining Co. in 1940 and turned control of the
company over to his son Charles in 1961. After he died in 1967,
Charles renamed the company Koch Industries.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Truth is ... you can't handle the
truth
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor ol' Pat Buchanan and Jesse Ventura. They let some truth
leak out of their lips. Boy! They're in trouble now.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``truth.'' It's the truth as they believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, in his new book, says America should have avoided war
with Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, in an interview with Playboy magazine, says religion is
a crutch for the weak.
</P>
<P>
   Here's good advice. Don't do a Playboy interview. It never turns
out well for the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Remember poor ol' Jimmy Carter admitting that he had lusted in
his heart? If they can pin down something prurient about Jimmy
Carter, the rest of us wouldn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I admire Buchanan and Ventura for saying what they
really think. More politicians should do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it might take a little prodding.
</P>
<P>
   Best deal would be whenever a candidate for president was
assigned Secret Service agents, he or she would have a polygraph
operator allocated as well.
</P>
<P>
   How recent history could have been changed by truth in
campaigning:
</P>
<P>
   _ Had Clinton told the truth about his philandering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had Bush told the truth about his opinion on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had Reagan told the truth about what he knew of the
Iran-Contra affair. (Reagan has forgotten more about Iran-Contra
than we'll ever know.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Had Carter told the truth when he said he'd never lie to us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had Ford told the truth that he had trouble distinguishing up
from down.
</P>
<P>
   _ Had Nixon ... oh, well. The list is endless.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine if voters could know the truth of George W. Bush's
alleged cocaine use in his youth, or Al Gore's use of Buddhist
campaign contributions during the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   Who do you think we'd feel better about: Bush, Gore, Buchanan or
Ventura?
</P>
<P>
   The Scriptures tell you that ye shall know the truth and the
truth shall set you free. I don't argue with the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   But my personal observation is that if people know the truth
about you, it can set your britches ablaze _ i.e., ``Liar, liar,
pants on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   I remember when the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed Congress,
Time magazine quoted an unnamed politician as saying, ``If we could
have turned out the lights and voted, it never would have passed.''
</P>
<P>
   I know for a fact that the worst trouble you can get into
running a newspaper is to let a little truth slip in by accident.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest that newspapers lie.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly what they do is just quote other people.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is _ which is as good an opening for a lie as there is
_ the public doesn't want to know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't want to know about Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't want to know about Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't want to know about Iran-Contra.
</P>
<P>
   The list is endless, and growing.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? You can't handle the truth.
</P>
<P>
   That's a quote from a Jack Nicholson movie. It may not be
Scripture, but it's the gospel truth.

 &HT;    Tulsa's middle name is 'oil'
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ From not long after oil was struck here in 1901
through the first half of the century, Tulsa was the center of one
of the world's leading oilproducing regions. The city soon became
known as the ``Oil Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Although oil production in Oklahoma has slowed and the industry
is just now recovering from its collapse in 1985 _ when the price
of a barrel plummeted from $25 to $9 in a single day _ Tulsa still
considers itself the world's oil capital. To find out why, all you
have to do is pick up the Greater Tulsa phone book _ specifically,
the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   They're like Yellow Pages everywhere until you get to the letter
``O.'' Then, right after Office Supplies, the listings of
oil-related businesses begin _ hundreds of them.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 154 businesses are engaged in Oil &AMP; Gas
Exploration and Development. After that, the oil business gets
pretty compartmentalized.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to meet Tulsans' oil drilling-related needs are businesses
in the straightforward category of Oil Welling Drilling (nine) and
such specialties as Oil Well Directional Drilling (one), Oil Well
Casing Pulling (one) and Oil Well Drilling Mud &AMP; Additives (eight).
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of equipment, there are companies in categories for
Oil Field Equipment (66), Oil Field Pumping Equipment (four), Oil
Well Logging &AMP; Perforating Equipment (one) and, for roustabouts who
can't make a commitment, Oil Field Equipment Rentals (two).
</P>
<P>
   There are even three companies that provide Oil Well Fishing
Tools. That's for when your drill bit falls off and you have to
fish it out of the well bore.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever been to Oklahoma, you've seen lonely oil rigs out
on the plain pumping away without apparent human intervention.
Looks easy, right? Get yourself a lease, drill a well, and stuff
your savings account at the Oil Capital Federal Credit Union with
royalty checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Tulsa Yellow Pages indicates it's not so simple. If
oil wells were low maintenance, would there be 67 businesses under
the category of Oil Field Services?
</P>
<P>
   Their names suggest some of the services needed in the oil
fields: American Tank Cleaning Co., Protective Coating and
Sandblasting Co., Cherokee Hose &AMP; Supply, Hudgins Co. Pipe Testing.
Some of the suggestions are a bitoblique: J B Hot Oil &AMP; Steam Co.,
Blue Star Acid Service, International Blenders Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The names of tank-truck companies indicate they're often needed
urgently; if Quickdraw Tank Truck Service can't get there fast
enough, try Lightning Tank Trucks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If you're going to drill in the Tulsa area, expect lots of
competition _ the Yellow Pages lists 71 Oil Producers. Luckily, 27
Oil Marketers are there to sell the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a disaster, call one of the two businesses
listed under Oil Spill Clean-Up &AMP; Control.
</P>
<P>
   When your well runs dry, don't leave the well bore open; a child
could fall in. Call the oil-well undertaker listed under Oil Well
Cementing to eliminate the safety hazard.

   MEXICO-FUNDRAISING _ MEXICO CITY _ It makes Bill Clinton's
alleged irregular campaign donations look tame. In Mexico, corrupt
bankers have been accused of funneling millions of dollars into
political campaigns here. And despite prohibitions, candidates are
still accused of taking illicit donations, breaking spending rules
and usurping public funds to buy votes. The race to choose Mexico's
next president _ supposedly the most democratic election yet here _
will test whether electoral reforms can prevent wholesale political
scams from being repeated in this country. (Ferriss, Cox News

CARTER'S SUNDAY-SCHOOL LESSONS, BOOK DRAW FROM HIS LIFE'S WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter has been teaching Sunday school
since he was 18. He even taught in Washington, D.C., when he was
president. And he's still at it.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, Carter prepares a lesson, using his Bible and
Scripture references recommended by his denomination. Then he goes
to his home church in Plains, Ga., to teach a Sunday class for
adults.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it is a typical Sunday-school class.
</P>
<P>
   But when he arrives at the Maranatha Baptist Church, about 200
people are usually waiting to hear him teach. The Secret Service is
there as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some come out of curiosity about seeing a politician teaching
the Holy Scriptures,'' Carter said last week in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   His class attendees outnumber church members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have about 35 or 40 families in our little church in
Plains,'' he said. ``But our visitors come from everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, 28 nations were represented in his class.
``We have Mormons, Quakers, Jews, Catholics and also Protestants
and nonbelievers,'' he said. ``I love discussing the different
perspectives we have on the Scriptures.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's Sunday school lessons, in shortened form, have become a
bestselling book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took 52 of those lessons that seemed most interesting and
pertinent _ some humorous and some serious _ and put them in a
book,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``Sources of Strength: Meditations on Scripture for a
Living Faith'' has been on ``The New York Times'' bestseller list
and was recently released in a $14 paperback by Times Books.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons include some of Carter's recollections about his
personal experiences as president and as a worldwide peacemaker in
his role as founder of the Carter Center in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In the book's preface, Carter picks up on the title, ``I have
thoroughly enjoyed recapitulating the lessons I've taught over the
years. ... I hope they will be for you, as they have been for me,
sources of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Some chapters in the book indicate the content: ``Who Among Us
Is Superior''; ``The Art of Forgiving''; ``Woman and Man Equal
Before God''; ``Are the Ten Commandments Enough?''; ``The Laughing
Jesus''; ``We Underestimate Ourselves and Others''; and ``Take a
Chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter is one of our most honored ex-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Rosalynn, each recently received the
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
   His faith is deeply integrated into his everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was a little child, I have been a believer,'' he said.
``It's like breathing to me. It is as much a part of me as being a
Georgian, or a Southerner or an American. For me, religion is
pre-eminent.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean he doesn't have problems. He sometimes
overlooks God, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm struggling with some issues, I frequently forget
about my faith,'' he said. ``I have to realize I'm not
all-powerful. I do need help. I need to re-examine the priorities
in my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said having faith means individuals can reinvent
themselves for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant learning process,'' he said. ``Constant
self-education. With God, we can become more gentle and we can have
a more exciting, more adventurous and gratifying existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Such candor and clarity about deep spiritual matters is one of
the reasons, I'm sure, that people from across the world show up to
sit at Carter's feet on Sunday mornings to hear him speak.
</P>
<P>
   All of us are looking for some answers. And this man of faith,
very humble in his own way, seems to be on the right track.

WASHERWOMAN'S GIFT WAS WORTH MORE THAN MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The deadline for this column was well past when I opened up the
paper last week and read that Oseola McCarty had died.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't the kind of news you want to read with your morning
coffee, but McCarty's death was especially hard to avoid. It made
the front page.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, McCarty is the Mississippi washerwoman
who gave away her life's savings _ $150,000 _ to the University of
Southern Mississippi, my alma mater, so others wouldn't have to
work as hard as she did.
</P>
<P>
   And so, just as I was moved by her story four years ago, I was
moved by her passing. The story said that she had been told she had
liver cancer just three weeks ago, about a year after she had
surgery for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Had it not been for her gift, none of us might have heard of
McCarty or her selflessness, and certainly not in such a public
way. That is as much a tragedy, I think, as her death.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, people such as McCarty go through life
virtually unnoticed. I don't know whether that's good or bad. I'm
happy that in this case, we didn't have to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about McCarty again, I was struck by the number of
people _ 600, the story said _ who had added some $330,000 to the
original scholarship fund; and the billion-dollar gift her giving
prompted Ted Turner to make to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty and Turner both gave generous gifts, but I couldn't help
but wonder which meant more in the sight of God. The one who gave
all she had, or the one who gave a billion from his
multibillion-dollar bank account.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it occurred to me that the thing that made Oseola
McCarty different was not her gift. People all over this country
give of their time and money to institutions and causes.
</P>
<P>
   But while they give out of the abundance of their wallets,
McCarty gave out of the abundance of her heart, so that other
people's ``children won't have to work so hard like I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible promises us three score and 10 years of life. At 91,
McCarty lived considerably longer. I suspect that she lived well,
too, realizing that it is far better to store up treasure in heaven
than here on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   When she decided in the summer of 1995 to give away most of her
life's savings, McCarty said there was nothing in particular she
wanted to buy and no place she wanted to go.
</P>
<P>
   The things that we hold dear, that we spend our money on, were
of no significance to her. She must have understood that where
one's treasure is, there his heart will be also.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let me hasten to say that treasures are not all material.
In any position of privilege there is the danger that status and
power, for instance, become primary.
</P>
<P>
   T.S. Eliot would know what I'm talking about. In the play
``Murder in the Cathedral,'' he wrote: ``They who serve the greater
cause have the danger of the cause serving them.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, a company will lay off hundreds of workers to
protect one executive salary; and another company will employ tens
of thousands of children, some as young as 4, to work in
exhausting, and even hazardous, conditions just to save a buck.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how many people took advantage of McCarty's
washing and ironing skills, withholding what her work was really
worth.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder Jesus said, ``It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the
kingdom of God?''
</P>
<P>
   McCarty's gift brought her worldwide attention and more than 300
awards. She gave us so much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about self-esteem these days,'' she was
quoted as saying once. ``It seems pretty basic to me. If you want
to feel proud of yourself, you've got to do things you can be proud
of.''

TEXANS SHOULD EXERT SOME PRIVACY PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congressional representatives had commendable motives when they
passed the Driver's Privacy Protection Act as part of the Omnibus
Crime Control Act of 1994. They were trying to keep your vital
statistics out of the hands of people who may have less than
honorable intentions for their use.
</P>
<P>
   The federal legislation directs states to block the release of
personal information contained in state motor vehicle records. The
privacy concern was sparked by the 1989 murder of TV actress
Rebecca Schaeffer, whose stalker/slayer found her California
address by using motor vehicle records.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists typically must provide a litany of details about
themselves before they can obtain a driver's license: name,
address, telephone number, Social Security number (you can try to
opt out of giving that information in Texas, but expect a wrestling
match), height, eye color, thumbprints and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of some of this information _ by most state laws, only
names, addresses, birth dates and driver's identification numbers _
to individuals and marketing firms means real money, particularly
in heavily populated states. According to the U.S. Department of
Justice, New York's motor vehicle department raked in $17 million
in one year by selling driver records.
</P>
<P>
   The federal act has run into legal problems, however, and is the
focus of a Supreme Court challenge this fall. South Carolina
officials are contending that Congress violated the 10th Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution by passing a law that forces states to run
a federal program.
</P>
<P>
   The berobed justices will decide if Congress overstepped its
bounds in 1994 by telling sovereign states what they can and cannot
do with state-controlled records. In the meantime, the Texas
Legislature passed a statute in 1997 to give Texans more control
over who has access to personal information given to state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Although no overt constitutional problems have arisen from the
state program, it has run into its own difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Texans, at the time they get or renew a driver's license or
vehicle registration, may request that their personal information
not be sold to marketing firms that buy lists from state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The law applies to information collection by the state
departments of Transportation and Public Safety. The Department of
Parks and Wildlife, which collects similar information for boat
registrations and hunting and fishing licenses, wasn't included in
the law but has adopted the restrictions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report last month in ``The Wall Street Journal,''
the Texas Department of Transportation sells its lists without
removing the names of people who have opted out. The department
just makes a notation on the names whose owners have requested
deletion and leaves it up to the marketing firms and list buyers
not to use them.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Safety and the folks at Parks and
Wildlife have found ways to eliminate the names of people not
wishing their information to be sold. But of at the state's
Transportation Department contend that removing the names would
necessitate keeping two separate databases and that this is a less
than ideal or efficient way of operating.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by the ``Journal'' reporter why some agencies can
accomplish this but they cannot, transportation officials declined
to explain, saying only that the department is complying with the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The law, as amended by the Texas Legislature in 1997, requires
that ``persons are provided an opportunity, in a clear and
conspicuous manner, to opt out and prohibit the use'' of their
information. It does not specify how each agency will carry out
that provision.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokesman for the Transportation Department, it
is up to the companies that buy the lists to police themselves to
make sure they don't use names that are flagged for nondisclosure.
If a marketing company does use such names, it would be in
violation of its contract with the state and risk the ability to
buy weekly updates or future lists.

INDEX FUNDS SHOULD HELP PAY OFF STUDENT LOAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 49-year-old single woman who recently finished
graduate school. Currently I earn $32,000 a year. I live in an
apartment, and the only debt I have is $20,000 in student loans
that have interest rates between 7.66 percent and 8.26 percent. I
have a combined amount of $2,200 in my savings and checking
accounts. Recently I received a $60,000 inheritance, which I was
considering using to pay off my entire student loan. I can save at
least $400 a month. I would like to know where and how to invest
this inheritance and future moneys. I would like some ideas to
insure a comfortable life in retirement. My Social Security is
estimated at $7,000 a year, based on my past employment.
</P>
<P>
   M.B., Northampton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You'll have to save pretty aggressively to achieve that
comfortable retirement, but the $60,000 inheritance certainly gives
you a nice leg up. Given that building your retirement account
should be your primary focus, I'd abandon the idea of prepaying the
student loans. If you invest the money for long-term growth, the
returns should exceed the interest level on the student loans.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to put the money in Vanguard index funds.
I suggest you explore two avenues. The first is direct ownership of
funds in taxable accounts, and the second is using variable annuity
accounts, which will defer the taxes on the growth within the
account. Thinking about taxes is important, because if you invest
the money now and embark upon a program of adding $400 a month to
your retirement savings, you would amass $456,164 by age 65, a
projection which assumes 10 percent average annual portfolio
growth. In the final year of that projection, you would be
contributing the same $400 a month as now, but more than $41,000
would be added through internal growth.
</P>
<P>
   If your portfolio growth is taxed each year as it is realized,
you could well reach a point that you would have to withdraw money
from the fund accounts to pay the taxes they generate. But with the
variable annuities, youd face tax liabilities (only on the internal
growth of the account) only when it is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to divide your investments 50-50 between
variable annuities and taxable accounts. I suggest a portfolio made
up of 50 percent Vanguard Index 500, and 16 2/3 percent each in
Vanguard Mid-Cap Index, Vanguard Small-Cap Index, and Vanguard
Balanced Index.
</P>
<P>
   As for your additional savings, I suggest you start by putting
$166 a month of your extra income into a Roth IRA invested in
Fidelity Health Care fund. While Roth IRAs do not provide you with
the tax deduction you can get from traditional IRAs, they
compensate for this by allowing withdrawal of all funds --
including the growth within the account -- on a tax-free basis once
you reach your retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining $233 to be saved, Id suggest a good proven
value-oriented stock fund such as Vanguard Windsor II or Vanguard
Index Value.
</P>
<P>
   A few final pointers: Since winning your graduate degree should
propel you into as higher earning capacity, calculate your current
retirement savings as a percentage of your income, and then
increase the dollar savings level by applying the same percentage
of your earnings each time you get a raise. If you become eligible
to participate in a 401(k) or 403(b) plan or any other tax-deferred
savings plan, join it, whether or not your employer matches your
contributions. Like the variable annuity accounts, this will defer
the taxes on this money until you are in your non-earning
retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, treat the retirement savings program as a discipline --
you are starting pretty late, and you can't afford to miss a
payment or two from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been tempted to invest in high-yield uninsured
certificates such as are advertised in the enclosed clipping. They
pay between 8.5 percent and 10 percent interest. I've received the
companies statements and still cant decide if its safe enough. I
have a large amount of money in Vanguards Prime Money Market fund,
which pays 4.9 percent interest, but that is also not insured,
although I don't lose sleep about it. What do you think of the
offers represented in the clip?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Saylorsburg, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think much of it, to be honest. When you read the
fine print, you see that the advertised rates are teasers. For
example, in the ad you sent, the company offered a 7.79 percent
yield if you invested $50,000 or more, or a 7.25 percent yield if
you invested as little as $5,000. But the catch is that this rate
only applies until Jan. 15, 2000 -- after that the rate will be
adjusted weekly.
</P>
<P>
   So while the headline on the advertisement proposes that you
lock in the high rates, the lock quickly comes off and you then
will have a variable-rate certificate. If you invested the $5,000
minimum you would be only $30 ahead of the yield on the Vanguard
money market fund, assuming it held at the level it was at when you
wrote. Actually, it would probably be less than $30, since the
Prime Money Market funds yield has risen to 5.07 percent as this is
written.
</P>
<P>
   What I suggest you do is go through the literature you have been
sent, seeking to determine first what yields these certificates
have actually paid after the lock in period has expired, and
second, what is the credit quality of the ultimate borrowers. My
guess is that the closer you look, the less attractive these
instruments are.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are beginning a retirement savings plan. We are
40 and 37 years old and earn $80,000 combined. We bought our house
two years ago. We invest $791 a month which is evenly divided
between Mainstay Growth and Equity and Fidelity Contrafund II
funds. We put $166 a month into a Roth IRA invested in Mainstay
Capital Appreciation fund, and $250 a month each into Janus Twenty
and Dreyfus S&AMP;P Index funds. We have about $7,000 in a Vanguard
Index 500 account. Finally, we have an emergency fund to which we
contribute $250 a month. In two months, we will be able to raise
our savings level to $2,000 a month. Is our portfolio too heavily
weighted with aggressive growth funds? Should we include a midcap
and an international fund. How will out net worth look in 15 years?
</P>
<P>
   S.S., Orange, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. To begin with the punch line, if you raise your monthly
savings level from $1,707 to $2,000 after two months and if you
achieve average annual portfolio returns of 10 percent, you would
amass $826,866 in 15 years (and $1,485,008 after 20).
</P>
<P>
   I think the relative lack of diversification in your portfolio
is more troublesome than the concentration of growth funds. I'm not
sure what you refer to as Mainstay Growth and Equity; perhaps you
mean Mainstay Growth Opportunity and Mainstay Equity Income or
perhaps Mainstay Equity Index.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way it goes, it adds up to too much reliance on
large-cap domestic stock funds. So you should indeed look for
mid-cap and international positions, and if I were you I'd also
establish positions in a small-cap and a health care fund, keeping
each of these minor themes in the overall portfolio limited to
about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I based the estimate of 10 percent long-term portfolio growth on
the idea that within a year or two you will feel that youve
established enough in that emergency fund and will then divert
those savings into the stock funds which form the core of the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   I am hoping that the account to which you contribute that $791 a
month is a 401(k) or some other tax-deferred savings plan. If not,
I would look beyond the Roth IRA for more tax-advantaged saving
vehicles. If neither of you have tax-deferred savings plans
available at work, I suggest you consider putting a sizable part of
your retirement savings in variable annuities, which are available
from most major mutual fund companies, and which tend to be modeled
on and track the results of the more popular retail funds.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small amount of insurance involved in the variable
annuity contract, which is what qualifies these instruments for tax
deferral. The cost of this insurance generally tends to reduce the
variable annuity account performance to a level about 1/2 percent
lower than that of the corresponding retail funds. In my opinion,
that 1/2 percent is an attractive price to pay for the tax
deferral.

THE CHAMP'S DAUGHTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, N.Y. _ Razor Ruddock has been around boxing long enough
to know that just because a marquee says you're the main event
doesn't mean you're ``The Main Event.'' That is why he showed up
more than a half-hour late for his press conference Thursday at the
Turning Stone Casino knowing no one would care a bit, if they even
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for being late but I see you had someone to
entertain you,'' Ruddock said, nodding to a pretty young girl in
the corner. ``You're not here for me anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   A room packed with more than a dozen photographers and an equal
number of TV cameras from as far away as Europe made that clear the
moment the pretty young girl strode into the room. As Laila Ali
sauntered through the door with the regal carriage of Zena the
Warrior Princess, flashbulbs exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The flashes persisted until long after common sense would argue
they had all the shots they needed. They persisted even after she
had finally settled down on the dais to await the inevitable
questions she knew were coming at her.
</P>
<P>
   When the 21-year-old daughter of Muhammad Ali began to speak, it
was clear no one else was in the room. Even though it was jammed
with bodies, no one else mattered now that she'd arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Same as it was for her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are wondering, so many people have questions,''
she said. ``But I wouldn't be up here talking all this mess if I
was going to go in the ring and do nothing. I'm the one you all
gonna watch. I'm the one you all gonna follow. I'm the one.''
</P>
<P>
   She may well be the one, but somehow the words sounded hollow.
Just as her skill in the boxing ring she enters for the first time
will be measured against that of her father, so too will her words.
</P>
<P>
   This is not fair when you are talking about the greatest boxer
in history and the biggest name in sports in our lifetime, but it
is no less fair than a rich kid from Los Angeles with no experience
stealing the thunder from a guy who twice fought for the
heavyweight title of the world. So what's fair and what isn't fair
isn't what this is all about, as Laila Ali seems to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad never had this much attention on him when he was first
fighting,'' she said. ``There are so many expectations. There is so
much pressure on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised. I grew up around this. I saw it coming
before anyone else did. My father's Muhammad Ali, so at this point
I don't feel people are just here for me. That's not going to
happen until I do something. I had to decide if I wanted to deal
with that. I'm here dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   What she's dealing with is prurient interest far out of
proportion to her accomplishments in a boxing ring, because until
now Laila Ali has none. Until she steps into a ring jammed into a
casino ballroom and faces a pudgy challenger from Michigan City,
Ind., named April Fowler, Laila Ali will be nothing more than a
sideshow, a carnival act trading upon the reputation of boxing's
greatest name the way Buffalo Bill Cody traded on his own
reputation at corny Wild West shows long after the West had been
won.
</P>
<P>
   The young Ali knows this, just as she knows the stunning good
looks she inherited from Ali and his third ex-wife, the beautiful
model Veronica Porsche, are all part of the attraction. Although
this fight is about her, the crowd she will attract is more about
her father, the greatest boxer who ever lived in the eyes of most
who ever saw him fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is more about her than it is about Ruddock, who will box
a familiar journeyman named Jose Ribalta in an attempt to keep his
search for a world title fight going on a night when few will
notice the outcome. Of that much Ruddock was not the only one who
was sure. So, too, was the quiet waitress from Indiana, fodder for
a new Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a waitress at Ye Olde Benny's,'' said Fowler, who has lost
her only professional fight but won three Tough Person (is that a
gender?) contests before deciding to become a true prize fighter.
``I like my job as a waitress better than boxing, but the
pressure's not on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to prove. I'm not getting into the ring with
her father. I'm getting in the ring with her. She's just a name to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. She's just a name to everybody, which is why the room
was jammed Thursday and why it will be overflowing. Not because
Laila Ali can fight, because no one knows if she can or can't,
including herself.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the continuing story of Razor Ruddock's comeback either
and certainly not for the second professional fight of April
Fowler's career.
</P>
<P>
   No, the room will be jammed to see if a 5-foot-10-inch,
168-pound rich girl has the right stuff. The stuff that made her
father someone who not only could call himself ``The Greatest'' but
could back it up. The stuff to be called Ali in a boxing ring.
</P>
<P>
   Is she the exception to boxing's rule that you don't discover
boxers in Beverly Hills or is she just another Hollywood fiction
weaved out of thin air and hype?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she has a great amount of courage and character to do
this,'' said Mike Acri, a small-time promoter from Eire, Pa., who
is handling her career for now. ``She's going into the ring with
big expectations in the shadow of the greatest fighter who ever
boxed. She could be doing a ton of other things. She already owns
her own business. But she's here.''
</P>
<P>
   She is, and because she is, so are some of the biggest
newspapers and television networks in America, although the fight
will not be televised live. So, too, are representatives from
London's tabloids and Germany's national TV network.
</P>
<P>
   Here not because she's a kid who grew up well-to-do in Hancock
Park, went astray for a while, and got busted for shoplifting and
spent three months in juvenile hall, owns her own nail salon and
decided a year ago to try her hands at boxing. No one is here to
tell that story.
</P>
<P>
   They are here for a simpler reason and a bigger story. They are
here to see how far the apple falls from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to knock somebody out!'' Ali shouted at one point,
her eyes glowering before she smiles the kind of smile that comes
from $15,000 worth of dental work as a teenager. ``My friends feel
this is right down my alley. I think I'll be a great boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not trying to be like my father. I'm just at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but of what? Of a boxing career? Or, as some including her
mother have theorized, at the beginning stage of some long walk to
find the father who left her when she was 8?
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Porsche will there to support her daughter and rumor is
her father may come in by private jet. Both have made clear they
are against this idea, yet they support it in the way parents of
21-year-olds must. Because they have no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   Laila Ali understands that too, understands that while she is
fighting for herself others are involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to do something I just do it,'' she said. ``I want
to do this. I started this to stay fit but I liked it. I feel at
home in the ring. I don't care what anyone else has to say about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad has never said he's against it but he's made it known.
I think he's pleased I'm an independent thinker, but if he could
program my brain not to be a fighter I think he would.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never told me flat out not to box, but like any father he
doesn't want his daughter to get hurt. He brought up all the
negative things so you get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, Ali did more than that. While his daughter and her
trainer/boyfriend, cruiserweight Johnny McClain, were visiting him
on his farm in Michigan, he went over to watch her train. As she
moved, he slowly began to move as well, his body a shadow of what
it had been before boxing and Parkinson's syndrome slowed it to a
crawl.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Ali offered to spar with his daughter. She
agreed, assuming she knew what was coming. She did not, which was
her father's point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel I could hit him that hard and he ended up
popping me,'' she recalled. ``It sort of surprised me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Laila Ali's first surprise in boxing. If she stays for
long, it won't be her last.

BIG UGLY 
By William F. Weld 
Simon &AMP; Schuster, 232 pp., $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Weld's at it again. No, not running for office, but writing
novels. His second Terry Mullally suspense novel, ``Big Ugly,'' is
out. (The first one concerning the up-from-poverty Irish
prosecutor-turned-pol, ``Mackerel By Moonlight,'' was published
last fall.)
</P>
<P>
   It's set in the swirling cutthroat world of contemporary
presidential politics, so naturally, the horse-race question comes
immediately to mind: Is it a winner? But since we speak of Weld the
writer of prose fiction, and not the political office-holder or
-seeker, the outcome can't be so readily calibrated.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with well-earned praise, because the former
Massachusetts governor is manifestly a very able writer: a slick
creator of character; author of brisk, crisp dialogue; and imaginer
of fully entertaining, and often flavorfully eccentric, vignettes.
Mullally is a colorfully faceted protagonist and as nicely
ambiguous a centerpiece as you tend to find in good genre fiction.
In this book, the one-time Democratic district attorney in
Massachusetts has scrapped his way to the US Senate and now is
savoring the fearful heights of power. As the waggish Weld-Mullally
observes in one of the book's pithier gibes, ``The difference from
regular roller coasters is, in Washington at least somebody gets
thrown to their death on every ride.'' Mullally is bright,
charming, and deeply tarnished, likable as much for his private,
deprecating self-doubt and humanizing guilt as for his silvery
sociability.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major players Weld brings vividly to life in ``Big
Ugly'' are Happy Gilliam and Vivian Anson, older, smoother
Democratic senators vying for the 2000 presidential nomination and
for freshman Mullally's support. Gilliam is literally outsize, a
giant philandering Texan as crude and congenial as Lyndon Johnson,
but less than half as smart and twice as corruptible. His homespun
speech _ ``prass spoats'' for price supports _ reveals Weld's sharp
ear for dialect.
</P>
<P>
   Anson is an even nicer piece of work, a populist West Virginian
Weld richly appoints with endearing Southern idiosyncracies. The
scenes involving Mullally and his wife's visit to Anson's home in
Big Ugly, W. Va., are the best in the book, sharply observant of
the snake-infested natural world, and often hilarious. The most
outrageous one concerns another West Virginian, a gifted,
hippie-haired Washington-lawyer friend of Anson who is also a
park-bench wino. Hung over after a night of revelry, he addresses a
goofy Sunday sermon to Anson's muddy hogs while tossing them slop.
</P>
<P>
   This is what keeps us reading: the full-bodied humor, snappy
chatter, curious specimens.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   The real mystery here is the whereabouts of a plot. It wouldn't
be accurate to say that Weld is troublingly digressive _ because
there just isn't any discernible narrative path from which to
wander. Yes, Mullally has a deeply stained past that might whiplash
his life and career, and present corruption in high places also
threatens to topple him (and the vice president). But Weld treats
these actions, which should be throttling the story forward, as
minor props, as, at best, bright swatches of local color.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in his truncated second term as governor, Weld was
accused of losing interest in the job, of lacking focus and
commitment. It's perhaps glib to say, but true nonetheless, that
his second book betrays a similar lack of close attention and
follow-through. Otherwise, it would surely tell a story instead of
merely, if very inventively, creating intriguing political scenery
and spicing it with his rogues.
</P>
<P>
   This is all too bad, because if ``Big Ugly'' worked better as a
novel, it might also have been a more convincing riff on the
intoxication of political power and its almost inescapable tendency
to corrupt. Light genre fiction can be, and often is, a splendid
vehicle for social ideas and political commentary, but the binding
contract the author makes with the reader is primarily to tell a
good story.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Big Ugly'' doesn't, it can't be voted a winner.

PROBING HER PSYCHE WITHOUT POWER CHORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; From surface impressions, Melissa Etheridge enjoys a very
successful romance. She and life partner Julie Cypher (a
writer-director in Los Angeles) are sharing the upbringing of two
children and are regularly seen at high-powered entertainment
events, posing blissfully for photographers.
</P>
<P>
   So why does Etheridge's new album ``Breakdown'' have dark, moody
songs about love?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought people might think everything is fine and dandy, but
nothing is ever totally that way,'' says Etheridge. ``You have to
really work at a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Released this week, the album is her first in nearly four years.
It's another high-quality effort from Etheridge, but doesn't revel
in the anthemic, Springsteen/Mellencamp-like rock songs for which
the Kansas native (and onetime Berklee College of Music student)
has been known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come from a simpler place, a smaller place, a more
vulnerable place,'' Etheridge says from her Los Angeles home. ``The
album was born from not being on the road or rocking with an
audience. It came from going inward and from raising children and
from soul-searching questions to myself of `What is life all
about?' and `What are my demons?' I didn't want to force the
rockers this time. The song `How Would I Know' was supposed to be
big and up-tempo, but it didn't end up that way. My management
said, `Where is the rocker?' And I said, `Well, you may not get one
this time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take it texturally one step farther than anything
we've done before, but I wanted the vocals to still be strong and
serious and real,'' says Etheridge, who coproduced the album with
her guitarist, John Shanks.
</P>
<P>
   There's the fascinating ballad ``Enough of Me'' (``I give you my
soul . . . I give you my skin and my Original Sin''), a song about
an unrequited romantic crush (``Angels Will Fall''), the touching
``Into the Dark'' (``There's a place we must go _ into the soul,
into the heart, into the dark''), and the laid-back,
mandolin-coated ``Truth of the Heart.'' There also are two
transfixing songs about her childhood, of which ``Mama I'm
Strange'' stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a direct sentiment of my childhood and my
adolescence,'' she says. ``I still don't feel I dress right or am
as fashionable as the next person. . . . As a child, I'd have
nightmares about waves coming over my house or of falling down
stairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scarecrow'' (not the Mellencamp song by the same name) was
inspired by the late Matthew Shepard, who was killed because he was
gay. Overall, it's not always an easy album to absorb, but she has
taken a quantum leap in probing her own psyche without resorting to
the power chords of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge is generally quite happy these days. She and Cypher
have two children _ Bailey, 2, and Becket, 1 _ as the result of
Cypher's pregnancies with a male friend whose identity has not been
revealed. Being a parent has made Etheridge appreciate life all the
more _ another reason that Shepard's death hit her so hard. ``It
made me focus on life and why it's so precious,'' she says.

IT'S NOT THE DATE, BUT THE TURNOUT THAT'S IMPORTANT

<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ On a day when politicians and pork producers
from Derry to Des Moines were wrangling over New Hampshire's moving
its presidential primary ahead by a week, the man at the center of
the tempest fingered a 200-year-old newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gardner, New Hampshire's secretary of state since 1976,
Thursday perused a remarkably well-preserved copy of the Oct. 8,
1799, ``Massachusetts Mercury,'' with ads from merchants selling
goods off British ships, a notice promising a reward for capture of
a runaway slave woman and her 12-year old son, and Paul Revere's
notice, as Boston's first sewer commissioner, that all privvies had
to be shoveled out during October. (That must have been the first
Big Dig.)
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fredette, a collector of historical artifacts from
Fitchburg, had delivered the paper to Gardner, a bit of a historian
in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gardner is a man who takes the long view. A Democrat who's
become a local institution here, reelected regularly by the
Republican-dominated 400-member House of Representatives, it is
Gardner who is entrusted to keep New Hampshire first, if not in the
eyes of Iowa pols, then at least on the calendar of presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By moving the date of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
primary from a pencilled-in-but-unofficial Feb. 8 to an
etched-in-Granite-State-granite Feb. 1, the low-key Gardner
recently ignited a firestorm in Iowa. The move means that if Iowa
wants to keep eight days of separation between its caucuses and New
Hampshire's new Feb. 1 date, it will have to move up its Jan. 31
date. Otherwise, there'll be just three hours between when Iowa
stops voting and New Hampshire starts at Dixville Notch.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa is not so inclined to switch. It seems that the pork
producers of the nation have reserved hundreds of hotel rooms in
the Hawkeye State to chew the, er, pork, roast the ribs, do a
tympani on the tenderloin, and otherwise wallow in hog-producer
heaven. And the moving-up-a-week schedule shift affects thousands
of caucus sites, church halls, school gyms, etc., with disruption
of plans on a vast scale.
</P>
<P>
   The shreiks and caterwauling reached such a pitch that Iowa
Governor Tom Vilsack called Governor Jeanne Shaheen to demand she
bring Gardner to heel. Some New Hampshire legislators began
harrumphing about calling a special session to strip Gardner of the
power to set the primary date, a power he has exercised deftly
since 1976. On CNN, anchor Bernie Shaw grilled Gardner, who
explained how his hand was forced by Delaware's moving its primary
forward, triggering the portion of the New Hampshire law decreeing
New Hampshire votes at least a week before any other state's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of threats, bluff, elbow-tossing, and
venting, cooler heads prevailed, New Hampshire politicians cooled
their jets, sanity reemerged, and Gardner's date stood. Some Iowans
remain miffed; people who resent New Hampshire's gatekeeper role
continue to mutter darkly in other states, but the Old Man of the
Mountain remains the starter of the presidential primary calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our secretary of state did just what he was supposed to do,''
said Senate Majority Whip Lou D'Allesandro, a Democrat from
Manchester. ``I taught Billy in the ninth grade and 10th grades at
Bishop Bradley high school in Manchester, and he knows what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much sympathy in New Hampshire for Iowa's
discomfiture. ``They had their auction, their little tent sale,''
said D'Allesandro, making sarcastic reference to the Ames, Iowa,
straw poll last summer, where the Republican candidates dropped
between $100 and $300 for every straw poll voter they snared.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen seemed to waffle last week under Iowa's umbrage. But
after she took a quick head count, and found not enough votes for a
panic move of stripping Gardner of his authority, she scrapped the
notion. The Union Leader torched her in a Friday editorial for
``trying to take the granite out of the Granite State.'' It remains
to be seen if New Hampshire is punished down the road with fresh
attempts to dislodge its first-place pole position.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, with less than four months to work with, just
want to get on with the politicking here. Iowa, it turns out,
should have kept closer tabs on Delaware, and phoned Gardner for
regular updates. Like the space probe that burned up because NASA
screwed up the measurements, Iowa didn't nail down the details.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in politics, long-term trends can be obscured
by the short-term fireworks and bluster. Gardner this year
instigitated a town-by-town review of the voter registration lists,
which shows an inexorable leakage of party loyalty. Both major
parties seem to be losing their hold on voters, and the ranks of
voters eschewing party labels are growing. Here they are called
``undeclared'' voters; in Massachusetts, they are ``unenrolled.''
In the bigger world of politics, they are ``independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, the town of Derry lost 84 Republicans and
20 Democrats, but gained 149 ``undeclareds.'' Hudson, the only town
in New Hampshire that voted for the winners in every primary going
back to 1952, a bellwether of bellwethers, lost 46 Republican
voters and 335 Democrats since last November, but gained 235
``undeclareds.''
</P>
<P>
   And the pink sheets of updated voter registration totals
accumulating in Gardner's high-ceilinged State House office tell
Gardner this: ``I think it's pretty fair to say the `undeclared'
voters exceed either Republicans or Democrats.'' Why? It probably
reflects some disillusionment with parties, labels,
politics-as-usual. What is unusual here is the level of prosperity;
New Hampshire is richer than ever, the prosperity palpable.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not bode well for turnout. Some years, more than
80 percent of New Hampshire's registered voters will turn out, but
that's ususally triggered by hard times. Hyping turnout is the job
of the various campaigns. They should adopt the course Paul Revere
urged on Boston's privvy-owners of 1799: Dig harder!

`SUPERSTAR' HAS WHAT IT TAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SUPERSTAR 
Directed by: Bruce McCulloch 
Screenplay by: Steven Wayne Koren 
Starring: Molly Shannon, Will Ferrell, Elaine Hendrix, Harland
Williams, Mark McKiney, Glynis Johns, Emmy Laybourne 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sex-related humor and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one thing to trip over chairs and be funny for 10 minutes
on a ``Saturday Night Live'' sketch. It's quite another to bring
off a 90-minute claim on an audience's attention in a feature film.
But Molly Shannon's endearing ball of parochial school anxiety
named Mary Katherine Gallagher, with her too-short plaid skirt and
her face screwed into an expression of perpetual intensity behind
her horn-rimmed glasses, beats the odds and makes the jump in
``Superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   We laugh at her because she's so relentlessly serious, and
although the story is so slight as to be virtually nonexistent in
``Superstar,'' it does give her two things to be intense about. She
desperately wants to win a talent contest sponsored by Catholic
Teen Magazine with a first prize of a trip to Hollywood and a
chance to be an extra in a movie with positive moral values. She
also wants to cop a big, long smacking-wet Hollywood kiss from the
school dreamboat.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she goes around hugging trees. Shannon is so
closely identified with her character that she's funny even when
she's playing opposite a tree in a scene of one-way romance. Not
that Will Ferrell, her SNL co-star, is playing a character that's
much more sparkling than a tree. What makes his character named Sky
so funny is Sky's vacancy. He could be thought of as a tree with
dancing ability. His out-of-itness gives Shannon just the
springboard Mary needs to push off from.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the comic surehandedness is the obvious
chemistry between Shannon, Ferrell, and director Bruce McCulloch,
who recently teamed up with Ferrell to demonstrate their rapport
and also their shared mastery of comic dimness by giving us a
hilarious take on Woodward and Bernstein in ``Dick.'' Harland
Williams is a plus, too, as the mysterious Harley-riding school
loner and so is Emmy Laybourne as Mary Katherine's klutzy but loyal
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   They all know exactly how to play this material out, and the
script gives Shannon just the extra measure of sweetness she needs
to stave off two-dimensionality and keep us from feeling sheepish
about laughing at Mary Katherine because we know her tenacity will
eventually get her what she's after. The secret of Mary Katherine's
success is that she isn't afraid to risk looking foolish by trying
too hard. The secret of Shannon's success is that she knows just
how hard to try.

`RANDOM HEARTS' BEATS TOO TEPIDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
RANDOM HEARTS 
Directed by: Sydney Pollack 
Screenplay by: Kurt Luedtke 
Starring: Harrison Ford, Kristin Scott Thomas, Charles S. Dutton,
Bonnie Hunt, Dennis Haysbert, Richard Jenkins, Paul Guilfoyle,
Susanna Thompson, Dylan Baker, Peter Coyote, Kate Mara, Ariana
Thomas 
Running time: 133 minutes 
Rated: R (brief violence, sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' is A-list soap opera, high-class and
high-gloss. Maybe it would have been better if it had dipped into a
few B-movie moves. Rare and admirable as reserve may be in
Hollywood movies, it's a bit too reserved, too detached for its own
good, such decorousness having been imposed on it, one assumes, by
the presence of Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas. To their
credit, neither is likely to be associated with anything cheap. But
in a way, this works against them because the way of the movie
world also demands that there be a romantic interlude between them
as characters suddenly thrust into each other's lives after they
learn that their respective spouses have been sleeping with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The affair comes to light after the cheating spouses die in a
plane crash. They were flying to Miami for a weekend after
carefully setting up cover stories. As Ford's D.C. cop glumly says
to Scott Thomas's perhaps too-poised congresswoman from New
Hampshire, ``Sooner or later, everybody knows everything.'' What
hurts Ford's cop named Dutch Van Den Broeck is that while he prides
himself on being an ace investigator who makes his living noticing
things, he was the last to know. Thomas's pol reacts differently.
Her impulse is to slam the door on the hurt arising from her
betrayal, and move on. She finds, however, that it's easier said
than done.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Ford's cop spends most of the film losing a fight
to stay in control, while Scott Thomas's congresswoman spends most
of the film winning one. A credibility problem arises because each
character clearly is a keep-the-lid-on type who may feel things
deeply, but operates from behind some pretty formidable defenses.
Although the film will be attacked for taking its time getting to
their romantic convergence, I liked the gradualness of the
revelation each experiences. Given the shocking unexpectedness of
their mates' reciprocal unfaithfulness, the details shouldn't fall
into place too readily.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when they do finally throw themselves at each
other, the moment is unconvincing because we don't see them as the
impulsive people the scene tells us they are. In other words, we
feel they're being thrown together because the script needs them
to, not because we feel it's what they would do. Even though we
believe in the precarious, vulnerable, and even explosive emotional
state each is in, we believe it only cerebrally, not as felt
knowledge. Ford does better at letting emotion work its way around
the edges of Dutch's attempt at control. Scott Thomas's character
seems more intrinsically cool and distancing, even though she
softens appealingly in the film's last third. But for all its
handsome, careful craftsmanship, there's a vital spark missing from
the core of the tepid ``Random Hearts.''

BLACKS FIGHT BACK ON SCHOOL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In July Boston School Superintendent Thomas Payzant, Mayor
Thomas Menino, and the Boston School Committee rolled over and
thrust their hooves to the sky in racial rigor mortis. Mortally
gored by the 1995 suit that abruptly ended affirmative action at
the elite Boston Latin School, the city's powers were finished off
by the June lawsuit by four white families that sought to end
racial balancing in the rest of the system and return us to the
good old days of neighborhood schools. Those days, of course, were
good only for white families.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of fighting with whatever strength was left, the powers
took one look at the new suit and called for the gravedigger. On
July 14, the night the School Committee ended race-based busing,
there were at least 75 parents, both white and black, who tried to
remind the committee that without such busing, white families would
ghettoize themselves into Latin-ready schools in whiter
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the desires of two white parents meant more than the
scores of children at Latin who benefited over the years from
affirmative action, the demands of four white parents in the new
lawsuit meant more than the testimonies of these 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to pick our battles,'' Payzant said in a sugary
excuse. ``And the battles ought to be coalescing people around the
teaching and learning agenda . . . rather than believing that this
one change in the student assignment plan will work against our
commitment to high standards for all students, equitable allocation
of resources, choice for parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Payzant knew this was absurd since neither the McLaughlin nor
Wessmann families at Latin, nor the four white families in the new
suit were ``coalescing people around the teaching and learning
agenda.'' All they cared about was maximum white gerrymandering of
a system that is 85 percent children of color.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was transparent. Payzant and the powers caved in
to white noise because they fear no deafening roar from black and
brown families. Even though African-American and Latino sixth
graders in the Boston public schools face Las Vegas odds _ 1 in 100
_ of going to Latin, the powers assume that families of color have
their own hooves to the sky in political apathy.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Payzant, Menino, and the School Committee
may be wrong. Late last month, a rainbow coalition of groups filed
a brief in US District Court to oppose the suit by the white
families. The coalition includes groups such as the local NAACP,
the American Jewish Congress, and the Greater Boston Civil Rights
Coalition, and well-known individuals like Mel King,
desegregation-plan veterans Charles Willie of Harvard University
and Michael Alves of Brown, and METCO director Jean McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   Though not in the brief, Cheryl Garrity, president of the state
chapter of the National Organization for Women; Peggy Wiesenberg, a
board member of the Citywide Parents Council; and Tom Louie,
director of Mass English Plus have all vehmently denounced the
lawsuit. Other groups, such as Community Change, Affirmative Action
Voices, and the new Campaign to Defend Desgregation are saying the
clock will not be turned back.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesenberg is angry over her years of going to School Committee
meetings, and arguing for an expansion of advanced work slots to
little avail. Leonard Alkins, head of the Boston NAACP, and two
attorneys connected with the brief, Joel Eigerman and Michael
Weisman, warned that the brief was only a beginning. They are not
only fighting to stop the current suit, but they are considering
whether the system, like the state a few years ago, can be sued for
providing unequal education. They said the Latin situation is
symbolic of Menino's and Payzant's acceptance of inequality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, let's assume there is something to be said for
having to qualify for exam schools,'' Eigerman said. ``But instead
of having this divisive battle over scarce resources, why on earth
are there not enough places for the kids who qualify? Why not give
all the kids who qualify places?''

   Alkins and King said the brief was a beginning, not just of
legal action, but of civic action. He said the complaints of
parents has been increasing and growing louder in volume, reflected
in part by activist Chuck Turner's advance to the final in the race
for the District 7 seat of the City Council. The volume, they said,
is getting loud enough where soon it might make Menino and Payzant
awaken from their racial rigor mortis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting the message that Menino is standing for
white privilege and white preference in the schools,'' King said.
``People are getting the message that the School Department is so
hellbent on getting white people back in school, they will throw
black people down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Alkins said, ``I don't think people will accept a full circle
backwards. But it is going to take some dramatic action. Going to
School Committee meetings is not enough, since the committee is
picked by the mayor. It's clear that Payzant and Menino won't
respond to a critical mass unless it's a voting mass.''

GUMBEL'S GAMBLE, PART II 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's one thing to be haunted by something done wrong,
but as Bryant Gumbel returns to morning television, he will
confront the specter of something he did right.
</P>
<P>
   That something is the powerhouse known as NBC's ``Today'' show,
which Gumbel anchored for an unrivaled 15 years, hiring many of the
program's key players and driving it to the top of the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, he works for CBS now, and ``Today'' 's utter
dominance of the morning poses the biggest _ though not the only _
obstacle to the success of Gumbel's ``The Early Show,'' which
enters the breakfast battles Nov. 1 with Jane Clayson as coanchor.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Boston this week, Gumbel, who was accompanied
by Clayson, expressed the hope that his ``Today'' past will serve
as prologue to his new venture. He pointed out that ``when I
started in '82, things went south before they went north.'' When he
was named ``Today'' anchor, he recalled, skeptics wondered whether
Gumbel _ ``a black guy, a sportscaster, and a 32-year-old'' _ could
win the loyalty of a national audience. He noted that though it
took a year and a half, he proved them wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now another 32-year-old, Clayson, seeks the acceptance of a
national audience. A former ABC News correspondent who covered the
O.J. Simpson trial, the 1996 presidential campaign, and the
conflict in Kosovo, Clayson was chosen as Gumbel's coanchor only a
month ago, following a lengthy search that CBS insiders dubbed
``Operation Glass Slipper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of pressure, and there are a lot of
expectations,'' acknowledged Clayson in an interview at WBZ-Ch. 4.
With a nod toward Gumbel, she added: ``I've decided that sitting
next to this guy is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Their on-camera rapport is what counts and cannot be judged
until Nov. 1, but off-camera, the two project an easy
companionability after an acquaintance of three months. Gumbel
joked, ``She reminds me of another Jane'' (referring to onetime
``Today'' cohost Jane Pauley); Clayson called him ``my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   But will they continue singing in harmony? Gumbel's relationship
with Katie Couric on ``Today'' was reportedly chilly; he is reputed
to have a prickly side. ``I know that's my reputation,'' he said.
``I've long since stopped baying at the moon about it.'' But he
insisted that ``I never yell,'' and maintained that he remains
``good friends with almost everybody I've ever worked with.'' For
her part, Clayon said she has found Gumbel to be ``a very gracious,
warm, caring guy. That's the Bryant I know and am eager to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   As he and Clayson try to pull CBS out of third place in the
morning, Gumbel's friends at ``Today'' aren't likely to cut him a
break, given how cutthroat the competition has become in morning
television (the only time period where network audiences are
growing). Nor is ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' enjoying its own
resurgence thanks largely to the presence of Diane Sawyer on the
anchor desk.
</P>
<P>
   But Gumbel seems confident he can once again make his own breaks
_ and he may have reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   He has few peers when it comes to conducting live TV interviews,
blending imperturbability with a slight edge of unpredictability
when quizzing newsmakers, and his range encompasses politics,
sports, history and show business. After nearly three decades on
TV, he brings his own large network of contacts to ``The Early
Show''; in fact, he refused to concede that ``Today'' or ``GMA''
will have an advantage when it comes to booking major guests _ the
so-called ``gets'' on which morning shows rise or fall. ``I don't
think we'll be No. 3 on the call-back list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though reluctant at first to return to morning TV, it is an
arena he has mastered, and in which viewers have embraced him _
unlike prime time, where his newsmagazine ``Public Eye with Bryant
Gumbel'' was canceled last year after just one season due to low
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Gumbel, who makes a reported $5 million a year, has been on the
CBS sidelines since then. When he returns to the air, a certain
tune-in curiosity among viewers seems likely; the power of marquee
names was illustrated by the ratings spike for ``GMA'' once Sawyer
and Charles Gibson agreed in January to coanchor the show.
</P>
<P>
   But Gumbel prides himself on a ruthless candor, and it surfaces
when he is asked whether his fans will still be loyal after he has
bounced from NBC to CBS and from mornings to evenings and now back
to mornings. ``I honestly don't know,'' he replied. Though the show
will clearly bear his stamp, he said he doesn't intend it to be
``drastically different'' from the traditional morning format of
news, features, and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   A lot is riding on his drawing power. In the past year, CBS has
become the top-rated network in terms of total viewers, but there
remains what Gumbel called ``a hole in its schedule in the
morning.'' In fact, due to the weakness of ``CBS This Morning,''
which ``The Early Show'' will replace, many CBS affiliates
preempted its first hour to air their own morning news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Once Gumbel was lured back to the morning, there ensued what he
termed a ``difficult dance'' of persuading them to yield the time
to the network show. Some have refused. ``It's a sore point,''
Gumbel admitted, saying he was hoping all the affiliates would get
aboard. In Boston, however, Channel 4 readily sacrificed the third
hour of ``News 4 This Morning,'' which has placed a weak third in
the ratings, so ``The Early Show'' can air from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he looks ahead to Nov. 1, Gumbel can't help looking back
two decades and marveling at the changes in the once-sleepy world
of morning television. ``Back in 1982, the morning was seen as a
rehash of the evening news,'' he recalled. ``Now, people operate on
a 24-hour clock.''
</P>
<P>
   And once again, Bryant Gumbel will occupy two of those 24 hours.

KLEIN SHOPS AROUND FOR MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calvin Klein Inc. is shopping for a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   The New York fashion house, which became legendary in the '70s
and '80s for its provocative advertising and signature designer
jeans, announced that it is considering a merger or strategic
alliance as a means to bolster its international business and brand
name.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid a flurry of such deals in the fashion world.
Prada recently bought a controlling interest in Jil Sander and
Helmut Lang. Gucci was recently acquired by Pinault-Printemps
Redoute of Paris, and now Fendi is reportedly being wooed by
several industry suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the mergers are coming at a time when brand names
are less relevant to many consumers who aren't willing to pay top
dollar for clothing. ``Today, most shoppers feel that they can be
very well dressed without going broke in the process,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a New Jersey
forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big companies like Calvin Klein are realizing that to make
themselves more competitive, they have to prune and pare their
overhead to become more affordable . . . The way to do that is to
merge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Calvin Klein brand has matured beyond its heyday
in the 1980s _ when racy ads such as the ones with model Brooke
Shields (``Nothing comes between me and my Calvins'') had everybody
talking. These days, competitors like Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Banana
Republic, FUBU, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger are dominating the
sportswear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his jeans business, Calvin Klein has lost market share to
Ralph and Tommy over the last two years,'' said Josie Esquivel, an
apparel analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. ``Tommy
and Ralph have also been very aggressive (in their) women's
business. I haven't seen that with Calvin Klein.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge for Klein and every other fashion house,
she said, is that operating in the industry has become much more
expensive. Many retailers are requiring suppliers pay for
advertising and in-store shops as well as take back or pay for
merchandise not selling. What's more, retailers aren't increasing
the square footage they give to design houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your product isn't the one that consumers are running
after, it becomes very tough,'' she said. ``If you're going to
grow, you have to find another channel of distribution to sell into
or open a bunch of stores. But that takes a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment, but in a statement released
this week said, ``We have made tremendous progress in recent years
in building our brand . . . now is the ideal time to consider
strategic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the outcome of this review may be, the company will
continue to build on its powerful competitive position in its
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein is a private company that doesn't release financial
figures but industry sources estimate its annual revenues are more
than $2 billion, including sales of apparel, cosmetics, and home
furnishings. Klein founded the company in 1968 with a childhood
friend from the Bronx named Barry Schwartz, who is now its chairman
and chief executive. Their combined initial investment was $10,000.
Klein and Schwartz each own 43 percent of the company, with the
rest held in a family trust.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said numerous companies could be interested in
buying or investing in Calvin Klein, including a competitor, a
retailer, or even a high-tech firm or an entertainment or media
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Julian, a fashion trend analyst for New York ad agency
Fallon McElligott, ``The brand is globally recognized. The image is
well maintained. I think the business has a lot of potential to
grow.''

BRITONS SAY PROFIT, NOT SAFETY, RULES RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As he left St. Mary's Hospital Wednesday night, a
bitter Steve Jones ruefully concluded that he and the rest of those
killed and injured in Tuesday morning's rush-hour train crash near
Paddington Station had been sacrificed for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a case of money,'' said Jones, 38, a management
consultant from Cheltenham who was treated for burns to his face,
arms, and hands. ``The people that died need not have died. The
technology is there.''
</P>
<P>
   The grim task of recovering bodies from the charred wreckage of
the worst rail accident in Britain in more than half a century is
not yet complete. But for 2 million Britons who take the trains
every day, perhaps most disturbing is the realization that their
lives have been judged not worth the expense of installing
state-of-the-art safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Many f them agree with Jones. But others say that while the
anger he voices is understandable, there is not an unlimited supply
of money that can be pumped into safety devices. Besides, they
argue, rail travel remains much safer than the roads, where an
average of 3,500 people die in accidents each year in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 15 times safer being in a train than in a car, and five
times safer than being on a bus,'' said Lucy Twitchin, a
spokeswoman for the Association of Train Operating Companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Louise Christian, a lawyer for victims of a similar accident
just a few miles west of Tuesday's crash, said it is inexcusable
that railroads have not put in the most sophisticated equipment
when they know it can save lives.
</P>
<P>
   As public outrage grows, there are indications that the
government, which has been trying to persuade more people to ride
trains, is changing its mind about the cost factor. John Prescott,
the deputy prime minister in charge of transportation, said
Thursday that if an inquiry into Tuesday's crash recommends
installation of safety devices that the government and train
operators rejected as too expensive, it will be done.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes too late for at least 70 people known to have
died, and more than 150 who were injured, when a commuter train
apparently ran a red signal and veered into the path of an express
carrying 500 people two miles west of Paddington. The collision was
nearly identical to the last major rail accident in Britain two
years ago, when seven people died in a collision at Southall, a few
miles west of Tuesday's disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike two years ago, ruptured fuel tanks erupted in flames
Tuesday, dramatically increasing the death toll. By Thursday night,
authorities had recovered only 30 bodies, and some 120 people
remained unaccounted for. The recovery process is expected to take
several more days.
</P>
<P>
   Against this gruesome background, the debate over safety is
growing daily. That this should happen in the country that
pioneered railways, and as the popularity of rail travel is
increasing, makes it an issue that goes right to the national
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Anthony Hidden, the lawyer who led the investigation into a
collision at Clapham in which 35 people were killed, recommended in
1989 that all trains be fitted with Automatic Train Protection, or
ATP, systems, which automatically apply the brakes when a driver
ignores a red signal light, as happened at Clapham, Southall and,
apparently, on Tuesday. But the more than $1 billion cost to
install that system was rejected by train operators and the
government as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's accident, the industry had calculated, based on
the average number of rail passenger deaths in recent years, that
installing the ATP system would cost $23 million per life saved,
and that it couldn't justify spending more than $3.25 million per
life. Since Tuesday, that kind of calculation, routine in
cost-effectiveness analysis, has sent a collective chill down the
spines of many Britons.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Prescott said an alternative Train Protection
and Warning System designed to prevent collisions would be
installed nationwide by 2004. Its advocates say it provides 70
percent of the protection of the ATP system at 20 percent of the
cost. But Christian and other critics say it is not as reliable.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since Britain's 20,000 miles of railway were
privatized, ridership has increased 20 percent. But so have delays,
overcrowding, and passenger complaints. Critics say privatization
has created a fragmented system in which a comprehensive approach
to anything, including safety, is more difficult than in countries
where rail systems remain under state control.
</P>
<P>
   While everything used to fall under British Rail, privatization
has seen the rail system carved up into 100 components. The tracks
are owned and managed by Railtrack. There are three rolling stock
companies that lease locomotives and passenger cars, five freight
services, seven maintenance companies, 25 companies that operate
passenger services, and dozens of subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the system, by which most of the 25 passenger
carriers hold the rights to a line for seven years, does not give
companies enough incentive to invest in safety.
</P>
<P>
   Since privatization, Railtrack and passenger carriers have
posted healthy profits. But too many of the profits have been going
to stockholders, not back into the system, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatized railway companies make huge profits,'' Christian
said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Railtrack is pulling in profits of more than $1.5
million a day, Lesia Kozlowsky, a Railtrack spokeswoman, said much
of that profit is being put into the infrastructure. She said the
company will spend $45 billion over the next 10 years on
maintenance and improving tracks and signaling.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Hutter, a professor at the London School of Economics
who has studied the railway industry, takes more than a
professional interest in the debate. Her husband was supposed to
take the doomed train on Tuesday but missed it.
</P>
<P>
   She said the scale of this disaster, and the government's
reaction, could lead to safety improvements once considered too
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a cost-benefit analysis,'' she said. ``But
the emotion in this debate could change everything.''

JOURNALIST ON JUNKET AT POSH MOUNTAIN SPA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ASPEN, Colo. _ The hot tub got them really steamed. It wasn't
the water temperature. It was just that I got to try it and they
didn't. They said they didn't dare, because someone from the press
_ someone like me _ might see them soaking and dismiss their
high-minded conference as a junket.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was something of a junket. But then again, it wasn't.
The truth about the Leadership Institute for the National
Conference of State Legislatures, held earlier this week, lies
somewhere in the middle _ like so much else that we report on and
write about.
</P>
<P>
   I went there to talk about the press. I had to fight for every
word, because my audience, made up of state legislators and
lobbyists, had a lot to say and very little of it was flattering.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly news that people today hate the media. But this
group also fears it and worries about it more than the average
soul, because it is more at risk for being harmed by it.
</P>
<P>
   What was sad was how equally cynical they are about journalists.
They assume the worst about each of us, perhaps the way many of us
assume the worst about each of them.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter offered plenty to think about on the plane ride
home. For instance: If I didn't participate in this gathering and
only heard about it from others, how would I write about it? Would
I write about serious sessions that ran from 9 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m,
with a break for lunch? Or would I dwell on the stunning setting,
pampered atmosphere and fine cuisine available at any number of
pricey Aspen restaurants? Is there a way to write about both?
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the conference, held at the Aspen Institute,
conjured up standard junket adjectives like ``posh'' and
``privileged.'' In October, the mountains are golden and so
beautiful you have to stop yourself from constantly looking up. The
air is cold in the morning, but warms up so much you will find
snakes lolling in the sun if you take a mid-day trek along the
river.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the tremendous natural beauty, there is an unnatural
concentration of wealth. Huge, sprawling houses ring the mountain,
rising higher and higher to capture the most commanding view. One
homeowner, you learn, is paying $4 million to tear down a structure
that irks him because it interferes with the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The Aspen Institute, which hosted the conference, is described
in a brochure as an ``international nonprofit educational
institution dedicated to serving leaders throughout th world.''
Presidents and prime ministers have been there, and weighty topics
are discussed and debated. But then again, there is that hot tub!
</P>
<P>
   Conference participants attended from all over the country.
There were no legislators from Massachusetts. House Speaker Thomas
Finneran was supposed to attend, but apparently decided against it
in light of the longrunning state budget saga.
</P>
<P>
   Junkets and misuse of public money are, of course, fair game for
journalists. But are we treating people fairly and honorably as we
pursue them? When they think we got something wrong, do we talk to
them about it afterwards, or leave them to vent via our voice mail?
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out they are partly right and we are partly wrong,
do we admit it, even to ourselves? If we just expose the elephant's
trunk, do we honestly believe we have drawn an accurate picture of
the entire elephant? And finally, why doesn't anyone ever write a
story headlined: ``Journalist on junket at posh mountain spa?''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the kinds of questions asked at the Aspen Institute.
Some were hard to answer. Typically, we are quick to dismiss such
questions, especially when they come from elected officials. We
have the First Amendment and they have to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   That is an arrogant view and an odd one, given the times.
Traditional print media are clawing to find and keep a niche in a
new communications world. Yet we continue to dismiss the consumers
of our product in a way that would not be tolerated if we produced
something like razor blades.
</P>
<P>
   We think we are listening to them more. But I think we are
listening less to our most loyal readers, ignoring them in search
of a new market that may never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the single-minded ``gotcha'' and the mindless
fluff are real stories that real people will read if we write them.
They don't necessarily want happy news, they want honest news. They
can take tough stories, if they are obtained fairly and put in
context.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how you can come face to face with reality in a spot
beautiful enough to be a fantasy-land: Whether or not we step into
a jacuzzi, we are already in plenty of hot water.
</P>

`LIMEY' HAS STYLE, BUT NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LIMEY 
Directed by: Steven Soderbergh 
Screenplay by: Lem Dobbs 
Starring: Terence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Lesley Ann Warren, Luis
Guzman, Barry Newman, Joe Dallesandro, Nicky Katt, Amelia Heinle 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not that much to ``The Limey,'' but its moody visuals
and performances do a lot to compensate for its story shortfall.
Still, all of its style can't altogether conceal that director
Steven Soderbergh doesn't have as much to work with here as he did
in his career-rejuvenating last crime movie, ``Out of Control.'' In
place of that film's charming waywardness, this one offers a grim
linearity as Terence Stamp's recently sprung British career
criminal journeys to Los Angeles to go gunning for the man behind
his grown daughter's death. The biggest thing he has going for him
at first is that in youth-driven, body-image-obsessed LA, nobody
takes him seriously because his hair is gray and he talks funny.
</P>
<P>
   A few corpses later, however, he's on everybody's radar. After
he guns down a few underlings and spends time brooding in a cheap
motel room, reading and rereading clippings detailing his
daughter's death while he was serving time, he zeroes in on her
lover, Peter Fonda's rich, tarnished record producer. Until the
foreordained convergence of these two aging angels of death, the
film passes the time with a few fairly entertaining set pieces, but
most of its interest stems from Soderbergh's realization that LA is
a great staging area for several kinds of alienation. He and his
cinematographer, Ed Lachman, tell us all we need to know about the
limey's fish-out-of-water feeling when we see him in a long shot,
parading in profile down an LA street against a huge windowless
wall aggressively sunlit with a surrealistic brightness.
</P>
<P>
   The film's architecture, in fact, says more than its characters.
Fonda's way of looking wiltingly elegant in the producer's showy
Hollywood Hills house makes him seem about to implode, isolated
despite being surrounded by party guests, trying not to crumble as
he senses life catching up with him. The presence of both actors,
of course, resonates with the '60s and their respective places in
that turbulent era. They impart an elegiac quality. ``The Limey''
even includes shots of Stamp from the 1967 Ken Loach film ``Poor
Cow,'' looking heartbreakingly innocent and hopeful. In this case
the device works, even if it leaves us to do the work of providing
some badly needed back story to a film that never satisfactorily
establishes exactly what particular surge of paternal feeling sets
Stamp's character in motion.
</P>
<P>
   We're never clear on whether Stamp's character is driven by
paternal love and a need to square himself with the daughter he so
often disappointed, or merely by macho bravura. To his credit,
Stamp projects a regret that keeps the first alive as a
possibility. Fonda, too, projects regret in a dozen ways, from the
way he holds a glass to the way he takes a phone call. It's the
regret of a selfish, shallow man, too smart not to see that his
life is arcing downward. One reason ``The Limey'' seems so
undersupplied is that the secondary characters are scant,
particularly Lesley Ann Warren as the dead daughter's sympathetic
acting teacher and Luis Guzman as a man trying to live down his own
criminal past. Stamp and Fonda give us a muted, rueful, and highly
watchable duet in ``The Limey,'' and Soderbergh's resourcefulness
will have producers standing in line hoping he can make their
underwritten scripts look as good. But ``The Limey'' can't outrun
its very visible limits.

`SELECTIVE BLEACHING' JUST MIGHT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My brick walks get moldy in the shade. How can I kill the
mold without killing the moss and grass? Some moss is on the brick
and looks very nice, but the mold is ugly.
</P>
<P>
   JEAN DURRY, Marblehead, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. By selective bleaching. It might work. Make a mix of one part
bleach and five parts water; this is weaker than the handyman's
usual mix (one bleach, three water), but it should kill the mildew,
and if it gets on moss or grass, it is less likely to damage it,
especially if you hose it off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   By selective bleaching, I mean brushing the bleach on the mold,
and nowhere else. Brushing with a paint brush (buy one for
exclusive use with bleach) will make this easier, certainly better
than trying to spray on the mix. You can let this solution dry,
then hose off everything with a fine spray. Or, spray when you see
the mold disappear. The diluted bleach will turn into a harmless
element when it goes into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am cleaning our flagstone patio that was just installed.
Spic and Span cleaned them a little, but there is a lot of
ground-in dirt on these old, used flagstones. What else can I do?
</P>
<P>
   JOE ESSEGIAN, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try power washing. Have it done by a pro, or rent a
power-washing generator at a rental store and do it yourself. One
good thing about power washing is that you don't have to add
detergent or any other cleaner to the power spray. Another trick is
to add a cup of bleach to the Spic and Span solution if you do not
power wash. This will kill any lurking mold or mildew, which can
last on a stone for years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I heard about your story telling of some sort of needle board
called Nicolet to keep pigeons and other birds away from my house.
I looked everywhere without success. People never heard of it. So
maybe I should come to you, the source. What is that material and
where can I get it?
</P>
<P>
   JOANNE BLAND, Hull, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you came to the right place, finally, but it is amazing
how the word of mouth can distort things. There is nothing like the
printed word, if you can find it. The needle boards are made by
Nixalite of America, not Nicolet, 1025 16th Ave., Box 727 Dept. PN,
East Moline, IL 61244, 309-755-8771 and 800-624-1189. It is not
sold in stores, that I know of.
</P>
<P>
   A company that makes a similar product is Ecopic, 725 South
Adams Road, Suite 270, Birmingham, MI 48009, 313-647-0505.
</P>
<P>
   You say people never heard of it? You talked to the wrong
people.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a small deck, only 4 by 8 feet, of mahogany
floorboards. I have not sealed them or done anything to them yet,
but the installer butted the boards tightly together. What can I do
in a case like that? The boards are square-edged, not tongued and
grooved.
</P>
<P>
   CLAUDIA CALDERHEAD, Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the deck slopes ever so slightly for water to run off, you
have two choices: 1. Apply a clear sealer to make the boards water
resistant. Apply this sealer once a year. 2. Apply a
semitransparent stain of the color of your choice. This will do the
same as the clear sealer, but will last three to five years. If the
deck does not slopes, your option is to trim each board with a
rotary saw to create a gap of 1/4 to 3/8 inch. If you create this
gap, you still want to seal or stain the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Another option: Have the installer take up the boards and relay
them with gaps. I think the drainage is most important, and I think
it is important that you get the installer to do it, because he did
it wrong, especially if there is no roof over this deck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My plastic Spring Ram America kitchen sink is four years old
and has developed rust stains. I was told to use Clorox, but it
didn't work. My friend's sink, similar to mine, is also bad. We
were told that maybe the finish was removed. I tried Soft Scrub,
also without success. No one ever suggested sanding.
</P>
<P>
   After all this, is there something that can clean up those
sinks?
</P>
<P>
   ETHA INDECK, Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Have you checked the manufacturer? Can you find the
manufacturer, or is he out of business? It sounds as if the sinks
are simply not very good products, and you are the unwilling
victims, especially if the company is out of business or is
unwilling or unable to help.
</P>
<P>
   Try this before you give up, an old cleaner: Apply hydrogen
peroxide to the sink, then sprinkle cream of tartar on the wet
finish. Leave for an hour, then scrub and rinse. If the sink cleans
up, apply a thin coat of Gel-Gloss. The handyman offers no
guarantees that this will work, and warns that there is a chance
that the treatment will make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing to try: Smear on Ivory shampoo, let it sit an
hour, then scrub and rinse. Again, no guarantees.
</P>
<P>

`HAPPY TEXAS' LIVES UP TO ITS TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HAPPY, TEXAS 
Directed by: Mark Illsley 
Screenplay by: Ed Stone, Illsley, Phil Reeves 
Starring: Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn, Ally Walker, Illeana Douglas,
William H. Macy 
Running time: 104 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language, sexual content and some violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every season needs its crowd-pleasing screenful of populist
froth, and this year's is ``Happy, Texas.'' Mark Illsley's
directing debut yields a disarming film of which Al Franken might
say: It's clever enough, it's eccentric enough, and doggone it,
people like it. Part of the reason it's going to be popular is that
it never attempts to be more than it is, which is a small comedy
that never tries to boil when it can bubble. This it starts doing
almost immediately as convicts Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam escape
when their Texas prison van rolls into a ditch with M.C. Gainey's
bad-tempered hulk right out of a Chaplin silent. You know this big
bad guy is going to turn up later, just when things are going well
for the escaped pair.
</P>
<P>
   And things do go well. For a while. We feel as liberated as they
do when they lose their prison jumpsuits, steal a Winnebago that
belongs to a gay couple who make a living staging beauty pageants,
and roll into the apocryphal little Texas town of Happy, which, it
turns out, has become pretty unhappy over the years because its
schoolgirls never get anywhere in talent contests. So the town pays
the pair $1,000 to turn the willing but raw elementary schoolers
into a parade of little winners, assuming they're the experts
they've been expecting, too innocently pure-hearted to suspect that
they're fakes.
</P>
<P>
   Northam is the handsome one, which means he gets to woo the
town's eminently wooable banker, Ally Walker's smart, earthy woman
tired of living the single life. Zahn is the funny one, though, the
one who's going to send you away feeling you've had a good time.
After making his presence felt around the edges of a couple of
hits, he's found his breakthrough role here. If you don't find
yourself laughing when he lunges and twinkletoes his way through a
schoolroom of preteen girls relying on this cellblock Baryshnikov
to get them to the finals in the face of their rapidly escalating
skepticism, check your circulation.
</P>
<P>
   He never lets his runtiness stop him from taking on anybody in a
fight or screwing his face into some pretzelly twists as he shapes
up the dancing tots and romances their teacher, played with bedroom
eyes, yet mostly for laughs (with the aid of impeccably bad
clothing choices), by Illeana Douglas. That rubber-faced gold
standard of independent comedy, William H. Macy, also chips in
mightily as the town's soulful sheriff, who bravely takes a few
bullets, then surprises himself when he even more bravely follows
the vagrant call of his own heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' doesn't represent the last frontier in
enlightened gay portrayals. But there's lots of generosity and no
meanness at all in its more-than-slightly dated gay characters. Its
bustle, color, and off-kilter writing more than carry the film past
the less-than-inspired patches, including a need to tie everything
up into a package. Walker, Macy, and Zahn _ especially Zahn _ take
the characters much further than you think they're going to go. I
can't imagine anyone not feeling entertained by ``Happy, Texas.''

BEN HEPPNER REACHES BEYOND `TRISTAN UND ISOLDE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest ticket in New York this season is for one of the
Metropolitan Opera's performances of Wagner's ``Tristan und
Isolde'' with Ben Heppner and Jane Eaglen in the title roles. Even
the Met has been caught off guard by the feeding frenzy at the box
office, although it shouldn't have been _ for more than 50 years
the company has been presenting ``Tristan or Isolde'' and sometimes
even ``Neither of Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the frenzy is that Heppner has no more
intention of devoting the rest of his life to singing Tristan than
his great Canadian predecessor Jon Vickers did once he had reached
the summit of this Himalayan part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a full-fledged helden guy,'' Heppner genially said
over the phone recently before going off to sing Schoenberg's
``Gurrelieder'' with the Pittsburgh Symphony. ``And I am content to
be what I am. I think of myself as a large lyric. When I look at a
score, I try to think of phrases as lyric rather than dramatic.
From the way I look at it, that's the healthy way. I can't sound
like some of those other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner makes his Boston debut as a recitalist next Friday
night, singing a program in Jordan Hall for the BankBoston
Celebrity Series. He's a relative newcomer to the recital circuit,
but he says he's learned to enjoy the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when I was in the university, I did some recitals because
I had to. Back then, there was always a sense of voluntary
incarceration, even when I went to recitals by other people. I
believe that recitals should have both entertainment and musical
value, so I try to find music that meets both of those critera.
Once my career got underway I got so busy doing opera and an
orchestral piece once in a while, there wasn't any time for
recitals. But two seasons ago I started singing recitals again. It
was a little tricky at first, and I felt awkward, but I've learned
to like this kind of intimate contact with the audience. And, from
what I hear, the reviews came out pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner's program, with Craig Rutenberg at the piano, begins
with Beethoven's ``Adelaide'' and continues with Berlioz's ``Nuits
d'ete.'' After intermission there's a group of powerful
Rachmaninoff songs, and then, unexpectedly, a nosegay of parlor
songs like ``Bird Songs at Eventide'' and ``Roses of Picardy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite thrilled by these old songs; it's an absolute joy to
sing them. I've made a parlor song CD which will be out in
November, and people are hoping it will become a popular crossover
disc for me. These are the songs my mother, who is 88, always
wished I would sing. There's a sense in which she doesn't think
opera is at all nice, but she can relate to music like this. And it
will be fun to sing them in Boston, where people must think the
only piece I know is Mahler's `Das Lied von der Erde'!'' (Heppner's
only previous local performances were with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in the Mahler cycle in two different seasons.)
</P>
<P>
   Heppner grew up in British Columbia and studied at the
University of British Columbia; 20 years ago, fresh out of school,
he won the Canadian Brodcasting Company Talent Festival. At that
time, he sang the lyric tenor repertory, although he was clearly
headed for bigger things. Over the last dozen years he has
developed his technique for heavier roles through studying with the
tenor William Neil and hs wife Dixie Lee Neil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Dixie just before I left the apprentice program at the
Toronto Opera. I was brought in to replace another singer in a
group of arias that couldn't be changed, lyric things, including
`Un aura amorosa' from `Cosi fan tutte.' Actually in my youth, that
one used to get me letters under the door from girls after I sang
it! We went through it and then Dixie took the score, closed it,
and said, `You've got to promise me one thing _ that you'll never
sing this again,' and I've taken her up on that!''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner warms to the theme of the affinity he feels between
Mozart and Wagner. ``I can still sing Mozart arias like `Il mio
tesoro' from `Don Giovanni' and Tamino's aria from `The Magic
Flute' _ although I do it without the sanction of the Lyric Tenors
Association! And then I can turn around and sing `Die
Meistersinger.' OK, lyric tenors, try that one! Actually I think
Walter in `Meisterrsinger' and Mozart's Don Ottavio are for the
same kind of voice, and Lohengrin should sound like Tamino.''
</P>
<P>
   He had sung Wagner's Walther and Lohenrin for years, and
recorded ``Die Meistersinger'' twice, before he finally accepted
the challenge of Tristan in Seattle two years ago. ``I can get
through it; that kind of suprised me! What you need to do in the
rehearsal period is to work through all those emotions that Tristan
has to experience, and that's not an easy thing. I found the first
rehearsal process to be quite hard on me in a lot of ways _ the
piece itself, the things I bring to it that make my own problems
worse, the mountain of mythology that surrounds the part, the huge
expectations of the audience, which is something I hadn't even
thought about. But now I have 15 of them under my belt. In Seattle
I ended up singing the part with cuts because I just wasn't coping
with it, and I had to sing it every third day. But I have since
done it it full-length in Florence and in Berlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner says he met Jon Vickers only twice. ``When the Canadian
soprano Lois Marshall received a lifetime achievement award, Jon
presented the prize and I sang in her honor. Later, at her memorial
service, when we were receiving instructions about how to move
forward, he came up to me and said, `So are you singing too much?'
`Why do you say that?' I asked. `Every time I open a magazine,' he
said, `you're in it.' I told him it was smoke and mirrors. I try
not to sing more than 40 or 50 times a year. This year I know I've
overbooked myself for Tristans; there are more of them than I ought
to sing. But I know my voice is healthier and stronger for having
done it. Still, I maintain a healthy fear about the piece; I know
you can't take anything for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner also knows there is more to life than singing; he knows
that his life outside his profession nourishes his singing. He
lives in Toronto and his family is very important to him (his
children are 18, 15, and 13). ``I had the chance to go sing
`Turandot' in the Forbidden City in Beijing, but after I finished
`Tristan' in Seattle, the only thing I wanted to do was go home. I
don't want to spend eight months of the year on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner's recording of ``Tristan'' with Deborah Voigt was
cancelled when conductor Sir Georg Solti died. Sony plans to record
the opera with Jane Eaglen, but with another tenor as Tristan _
Placido Domingo. Heppner is wistful about this lost chance.
``Recordings of `Tristan' don't come along every day. What I would
love would be a movement from one of the record companies to record
the Met performances this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Heppner is looking to move his operatic repertory into different
directions. ``When I did `Pagliacci' a while back, a couple of
things struck me. I was too young and needed more miles on this old
frame _ you have to know what you're about to sing that opera. I
needed to develop a sense that I could do whatever I wanted with my
voice and know I won't hurt it. In another six or seven years when
I'm hitting my 50s I want to try it again. By then, I'll have
something to bring to the role. And I'm planning to sing Verdi's
`Otello.' Watch this space for further announcements. . .''

GEORGE CLINTON STIRS UP THE FUNK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the next millennium beckons, George Clinton _ ageless
funkateer, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, the Atomic Dog himself _
will be in Fiji, dressed in some outlandish, colorful garb,
cavorting about a stage leading his 19-piece band, the P-Funk
All-Stars, in a celebratory set of songs such as ``Give Up the
Funk,'' ``Maggot Brain,'' and ``Free Your Mind.'' And at that
point, he will have been working as a professional musician for
parts of six decades.
</P>
<P>
   What is the key to maintaining the energy and interest over that
long stretch of time?
</P>
<P>
   ``Liking what you're doing,'' he says, simply, from his New York
hotel, earlier this week. ``The energy becomes its own replenisher.
If I ever get to the point, (of thinking I can't do this anymore) I
try to think of the alternative and the alternative is real hard to
think about. What am I gonna do 9-to-5? I go, `Hell, yeah, I can do
this some more.' I love it, it's my job _ I mean I get to go to
work for play. I feel lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   On the cover of one of his many albums, Clinton, asked this of
himself: ``Inspired madman or complete jackass?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is mulling these conundrums. Specifically, if, at 58, is
his world getting crazier or more sane?
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's probably getting more sane,'' he says, almost
sadly. But then he brightens. ``I gotta come up with a new
craziness 'cause everybody's catching up (with me). I'm gonna move
it into the sixth dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe him. Keep in mind that sanity, especially his version of
it, is relative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ a gent who sports many colors of hair, few of them
natural, and performs alongside a diaper-clad guitarist, Gary
Shider _ is the brain behind all sorts of groups including
Parliament, Funkadelic, and the P-Funk All-Stars. Parliament began
in the mid-'50s as a doo-wop harmony vocal group; Funkadelic was a
funk-rock machine kicked up in the late '60s. Over time, they've
also performed as Parliament-Funkadelic _ think of them as a Clark
Kent/Superman act. Clinton is touring now with the P-Funk All-Stars
comprised of Parliament-Funkadelic players. In his current bio,
Clinton lists his job title thus: Lead vocals, band referee, galaxy
traffic cop. In concert, his band generally plays three to four
hours. During some of that time, Clinton is onstage, the
ringleader. Other times, he says, ``I go out in the audience and
check it out for myself. Then, I go `Damn, it's fun being out
there,' and then I go back on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Clinton, of his show: ``I figure 1 1/2 hours is pretty much
what anybody else would give you, we give you the basic stuff,
stuff you know. That is for the people. Then we play another two
hours, like George Clinton bonus tracks, and we are going to do
whatever we want here. That is for us. We sing anything we feel
like singing.''
</P>
<P>
   One positive factor at a Clinton show is the way the audience
tends to come together. There is often a near-equal mix of blacks
and whites, and the vibe on the dance floor is warm. ``That is the
reason we do what we do,'' says Clinton, ``to make it one nation
under a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   His music is a favorite source of sampling by the rap
generation; his funk style is the blueprint for virtually anyone
out there playing in that field. His songs can be silly; they can
be profound; they can be a mix of the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be funny,'' he says. ``If it was not funny, you
would go crazy for real and you would end up as (messed) up as the
people you're singing about. You would be so (ticked) off, you
would end up as bad as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of nefarious characters on Clinton's latest
effort, ``Dope Dogs,'' where most of the songs use dogs both as
central characters and metaphors for the human condition. Why dogs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we basically are animals ourselves,'' says Clinton,
``and we tend to think that (being human) separates us from that.
Dogs are supposed to be our best friends, but we also use them as
the epitome of what you wanna do to somebody when you don't like
'em _ you dog 'em out. It's a weird relationship we have with dogs.
Some people love 'em to death, spend a fortune on 'em to keep 'em
alive, and bury them richly. Some people eat 'em, a weird thing to
do with man's best friend. When I saw people use them as drug dogs,
after they're done using them. . . . they're so strung out from
their habits. They have dogs in laboratories where they test
chemicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had some periods of dormancy over the years, but
he's now in full-tilt work mode. He's preparing not one, but two,
albums for release on his new label, Mammoth. The first, under the
Parliament banner, is likely to come in February and may be called
``The C-Conspiracy: The Last Time Zone.'' The second will come
later in the year. Also involved are longtime collaborators bassist
Bootsy Collins and keyboardist Bernie Worrell. You can add to that
mix, says Clinton, Henry Rollins, Flea from the Red Hot Chili
Peppers, Wyclef Jean from the Fugees, D'Angelo, DMX, and Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, wouldn't that latter guy be The Artist Formally Known As
Prince?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but George Clinton gets to call him by his original name.
Prince _ or the Artist, if we must _ has recorded Clinton, an
obvious influence, on his Paisley Park label. On the upcoming
album, the Artist plays all the instruments and sings backup on the
first single, ``Brother, Can You Paradigm?'' (Clinton is likely to
unveil some of the new material Oct. 29 when he performs on
``Sessions on West 54th Street.'')
</P>
<P>
   For all the nasty situations worked through in the songs,
Clinton leaves you feeling uplifted. ``To me,'' he says,
``everything will be all right by Thursday. That's what I always
tell myself.''

cancer-monitoring agency agrees to investigate claims that 58 years
of Navy and Marine Corps bombing practice on the Puerto Rican
island of Vieques has caused the high cancer rate among residents
there. The agency's action may complicate President Clinton's
decision on Navy demands that the target range be reopened. It was

   WORKING-COLUMN (Houston) _ Kendra Kennon is a large woman,
weighing more than 100 pounds than what her ``ideal'' weight should
be. Kennon is also charming, attractive and lively _ everything
that most companies would want in a customer service
representative. But Southwest Airlines doesn't want her because she
can't fit into a size 18 uniform, the highest size the airline will
allow for its customer service agents. By L.M. SIXEL. (Already

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Digital image editing, once the

Here's a look at three new versions of some of the most popular

   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``I upgraded to
Windows 98 Second Edition on my computer, and now it's doing the

make this go away.'' Assorted Q&AMP;As. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN. (Already

   HOMECOMING-QUEENS (Beaumont, Texas) _ Forty queens at one
homecoming might seem like wretched excess, but excess is what
homecoming is all about in Vidor, a town of 11,000 just east of
here. There will be 39 previous homecoming queens to greet the 1999
queen when she is crowned at halftime during the upcoming Vidor
High School football game. By RICHARD STEWART. (Photo available on

<P>
   COLOMBIA-MURDERS (Los Pajaros, Venezuela) _ The execution-style
slayings of three U.S. humanitarian workers by the FARC, this
nation's largest rebel group, outraged Washington, shocked
Colombians and threatened to derail a fragile peace process
designed to end a 35-year-old civil war. A look at events leading
up to the slayings sheds much light on Colombia's lethal triangle
of hell-bent revolutionaries, multinational oil companies and newly
enfranchised indigenous groups. By JOHN OTIS. (Filed Thursday.)

   EYE-SURGERY (Houston) _ If you have always struggled to see,
then you have always known me. I was the kid the teacher thought
was slow because I couldn't see the blackboard; the geek in the
Coke-bottle glasses that everyone called four eyes; the one who
went from hard contacts to gas permeable to soft and finally back
to glasses, this time, bifocals. If you have struggled to see
forever, then you know why I spent more than $4,300 to undergo a
laser procedure to fix what, for most of my life, has been
unfixable. By LORI RODRIGUEZ. (Filed Friday.)

 &HT;    INTERNET USERS WARNED ABOUT TRAVEL AUCTION SCAMS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (t) travel categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The thought of relaxing on a palmy beach, cool
drink in hand, is enticing to many stressed-out Americans. In fact,
it's so tempting that thousands are turning to the Internet to seek
out travel bargains. Unfortunately, in many cases, would-be
vacationers are relearning that oldest consumer lesson: when a deal
sounds too good to be true, it is.
</P>
<P>
   Even when your money is not stolen outright, you may find that
the ``luxury hotel and cruise'' package advertised is really ``a
trip to the roach motel... on a barge,'' said Phillip C. McKee III,
founder of the Internet Fraud Watch project of the National
Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech Friday to the American Society of Travel Agents,
McKee said that during the first half of 1999 complaints to the
watchdog group jumped 600 percent compared with the first half of
1998. The huge increase was driven primarily by the growing
popularity of online auctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The typical auction scam works like this: A con artist goes
online to say he has purchased a non-refundable vacation package,
but can't travel because his grandmother has just died. Bidders
offer to send him money, thinking they are helping out another
person while helping themselves enjoy some low-cost travel. But the
fraud perpetrator takes the bidder's money and mails out nothing.
If he does send something, it's a travel voucher issued by a phony
company that never books the trip.
</P>
<P>
   In another version of that scam, the crook claims he has
thousands of airline frequent flier miles that he must sell before
they expire. Of course, no such miles exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another travel trick is based on the old-fashioned pyramid
scheme. In this scenario, a fraudulent company offers the gullible
individual a chance to earn a free travel voucher. To get the free
trip, the victim must sell 18 vouchers to friends and family
members. The vouchers are either worthless, or provide
accommodations in grubby hotels with ``stained mattress and barbed
wire,'' McKee said.
</P>
<P>
   Still another scam involves the offer of both income and
discounted travel through the miracle of becoming a travel agent,
McKee said. Online companies offer to send you a kit of information
and credentials that will instantly turn you into a travel agent.
The victim sends in several hundred dollars, and the con artist
mails out a slim packet of largely worthless information. The
package contains none of the computer equipment or software needed
to enter the travel business. The agent credentials, which are
supposed to provide travel discounts, are not recognized by any
reputable hotels, cruiselines or airlines.
</P>
<P>
   McKee gives travelers this advice: ``free'' travel is never
free; it's a con. Never send money directly to someone selling
goods or services through an online auction. Instead, go to a
reputable auction site that allows you to send money to an escrow
account, which will hold the money until you receive what you
bought. Get every aspect of the deal in writing. Check references.
Pay with a credit card rather than cash or check. And never forget
that the Internet, with its fancy Web pages and invisible sales
representatives, can offer ``a perfect environment for fraud,''
McKee said.

 By PENELOPE GREENE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She was tiny and dapper in a trompe l'oeil ``jacket''
she had designed herself, its buttons and lapels coyly imagined in
needlepoint. She wore her signature amber-colored sunglasses; her
lipstick was rose pink and fresh. There were roses everywhere _
another signature _ blowsy ones clambering up the chintz chairs and
the pillows on the slippery green silk-damask love seat; sterner
ones nodded from bowls and a huge glass vase. You could smell them
with every breath. She took your hands and squeezed hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``So pleased,'' she said, her voice low and a little flat. ``At
last!''
</P>
<P>
   Fleur Cowles, the legendary editor of the legendary Flair
magazine, is very, very good at meeting people. If you don't get
the point immediately, refer to her 1996 memoir, ``She Made Friends
and Kept Them'' (HarperCollins), which is a daunting assemblage of
cozy reminiscences of her famous pals, which include just about
every news maker in the last half century: heads of state, movie
stars, major and minor royalty, artists, writers, socialites. Ms.
Cowles appears suddenly and ubiquitously in the newsreels of
history, chatting and squeezing hands and mixing it up with the
great ones from the front lines of Korea to the Shah of Iran's
palace. Ms. Cowles collects people as an avocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put it down to the fact that I was born to make
friends,'' she said, in the suite named for her at the Lowell Hotel
on in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowles and her doting husband, Tom Montague Meyer, a retired
British timber tycoon, were in town last week for the publication,
and the attendant celebrations and signings, of ``The Best of
Flair,'' a $250 boxed and bound album put together by Ms. Cowles in
1996 and reissued this year by Rizzoli.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost exactly a half-century ago that Gardner Cowles
Jr., the founder of Look magazine, published an extraordinary
confection of type and talent called Flair. Ms. Cowles, who
happened to be married to Cowles at the time, was its editor, and
quite infamous for her efforts at Look magazine, which she had
transformed from ``something quite vulgar, a barbershop magazine,''
as she put it, into a vibrant general interest magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But Flair was something altogether different, a delicious new
form of magazine, with marvelous thick paper that folded this way
and that, pop-up pictures, flip-books, books-as-inserts, scented
pages and a windowed cover _ die-cut in different shapes each month
to reveal a tantalizing image from the page behind it.
</P>
<P>
   There were stories by Colette, Tennessee Williams, Katherine
Anne Porter. You could see the work of Salvador Dali and a young
painter named Lucian Freud. ``The best things, the first things,''
it promised, ``uniting its readers in an aristocracy of taste.''
</P>
<P>
   After 12 issues and losses of almost $3 million (``It was a
fortune then,'' Ms. Cowles said), Cowles pulled the plug, breaking
his wife's heart. Four years later, she married Montague Meyer, and
left New York for London.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Lambert, the elder stateswoman of fashion publicity, has
known Ms. Cowles since the 1930s, ``when we were both just starting
out in New York,'' she said. ``Fleur had a column at The New York
Telegram or something like that, and I was representing a hotel in
Atlantic City. She's just gone from strength to strength. Part of
her charm is the extravagance of her luck, and the puzzlement of
how she has gotten along in life.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't learn how old Ms. Cowles is by asking her. ``The
Financial Times says I'm 83, but I'm not,'' she said, turning away
from the question. She's been ill, she said, and had some falls,
but then she has never been a robust person. At lunch Monday in her
hotel suite, Ms. Cowles dutifully ate cold pancakes, urged on by
her husband, while he drank his soup bowl dry and gazed at his
wife. They talked about Flair fans they've met around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just had my 56th one-man show,'' Ms. Cowles said with
characteristic aplomb. Ms. Cowles makes naive paintings of flowers
and animals, the sales of which are usually donated to her favorite
charity, the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked to show all over the world,'' she said,
delivering her lines with a freshness and sincerity that belied the
fact she's said this same thing in magazines, and in other
interviews, many times before. ``At every one of those shows,
someone, a young person, comes up to me with a copy of Flair to
sign. I made the magazine as an expression of me. I didn't want
yachts, I didn't want race horses, I already had enough jewels. And
then I made ``The Best of Flair'' for these young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Hayward bought herself a complete collection of original
Flairs a decade or so ago. Ms. Cowles saw them arrayed on a table
in Ms. Hayward's apartment, in a photograph in a decorating
magazine. ``She actually wrote me a divine little note telling me
how thrilled she was,'' Ms. Hayward said. Does Ms. Hayward see a
comparison between Ms. Cowles and Tina Brown?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't possibly compare her to Tina Brown,'' she retorted.
``Her magazines are vulgar. Talk is vulgar. Tina is after something
else, she's after buzz. Fleur is different. She is an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowles said she doesn't read contemporary magazines. ``I
don't think magazines have any great power anymore,'' she said.
``They send them to me, you know, but I'm not interested. They're
just shopping guides or travel brochures and I find them very
strange shopping guides. I get so angry when I see a dress, a
fantastic photograph, and all you see is the neckline. But people
still buy magazines to see what's in fashion. I don't care what's
in fashion. I never buy anything. Never. I don't want to look like
other people.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Ms. Cowles' clothes have been made
exclusively for her by a retired French couturier named Philippe
Lempriere. ``I send his children to college, and he designs only
for me,'' she explained. ``That's our quid pro quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cowles is a mid-century modernist with that American can-do
spirit. ``I have an idea a minute,'' she declared. ``I'm very
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   She extended her hand and showed off the asteroid of diamonds on
her pinkie, a Cowles design. She talked about her plans to bring
out a Flair guide to life; her book-in-progress about flowers, and
her collaboration with an animator to make two of the children's
books she has illustrated _ ``Tiger Flower'' and ``For the Love of
Tiger Flower'' _ into movies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, S.J. Perelman skewered Ms. Cowles' un-self-conscious
immodesty in a satirical piece in The New Yorker, which concluded:
``Hyacinth switches on her reading lamp, picks up a box of paper
clips, and patiently begins constructing a linotype machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Point made, but I'll bet Ms. Cowles could easily construct a
linotype machine out of paper clips. Could you?

EXPLAINING THE PATTERNS OF LIFE IN FRACTALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Ohio, N.J.)   By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a tightly braided woman's hair style from Yaounde, Cameroon,
the coils seem to spread out from the neck, split into subsidiary
branches, and erupt into repetitive patterns. An ivory sculpture of
the Mangebetu people is also based on geometric shapes in which
large patterns sprout smaller versions of themselves. So is the
architecture of the Logone-Birni palace in Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Eglash, a computer scientist and ethnomathematician at Ohio
State University, finds designs like these all over Africa, designs
that in their more elaborate, infinite form, are called fractals.
Each subsection of a fractal design might be an image of the whole;
a fractal curve generates itself out of itself, changing in size
but not in shape.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``African Fractals: Modern Computing and
Indigenous Design'' (Rutgers University Press), Eglash weaves his
own design, showing that a fascination with shapes that sprout ever
smaller versions of themselves is common to many African cultures.
They appear everywhere: in the layouts of villages, in the designs
on clothing, in the form of headpieces.
</P>
<P>
   It is a suggestive analysis, though there are reasons to qualify
Eglash's sweeping portrait. Many of these designs are not really
fractals but only resemble them. He also argues that the designs
are a form of African mathematics, but this seems an exaggeration:
mathematics involves not just the creation of a pattern but also an
examination of the principles behind a pattern, which seems to have
minimal significance in these examples. Eglash is so intent on
finding the design that he discerns fractal patterns in American
black voting districts and, somehow, in relations between the
sexes.
</P>
<P>
   But this kind of obsession with a repeated pattern _ for Eglash
and perhaps for the cultures he examines _ is not unusual. Such
recurrent designs are not merely esthetic creations. They are
metaphysical proclamations about how the world works. No shape is
arbitrary or isolated; each part resembles another; each part
resembles the whole. Even the structures of social and religious
life are affected.
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks, too, had such touchstones, in their fascination with
regular Platonic solids like the cube and tetrahedron and in their
explorations of ratio. A design is found within the natural world,
and that design in turn shapes the world that is found. A design is
a theory, a theory a design.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the case in contemporary science, which, despite
the increasing importance of computer simulation and calculation,
seems to rely more and more on artistic metaphors that invoke
design and pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Artful Universe,'' (Oxford, 1995), the astronomer John
D. Barrow argues that ``the arts and the sciences flow from a
single source; they are informed by the same reality; and their
insights are linked in ways that make them look less and less like
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The geneticist Enrico Coen, who has just written ``The Art of
Genes'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), uses painting as a
metaphor to describe how organisms generate themselves. Beautiful
natural patterns _ spirals, butterfly wings, rippling waves _ and
their mathematical origins are explored in Philip Ball's ``The
Self-Made Tapestry: Pattern Formation in Nature'' (Oxford, 1998).
This writer has chimed in with ``Emblems of Mind'' (Avon, 1996),
examining how music and mathematics create patterns that develop
out of similar styles of metaphorical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   This attention to the close relationship between the arts and
sciences is not new, of course. Two hundred years ago, the
philosopher Immanuel Kant suggested that in attempting to
understand the natural world human beings treat it as if it were
specifically constructed for their contemplation. They approach it
as if it had a particular purpose, as if each of its elements were
created for a reason, as if nothing about it were accidental. Kant
argued that man treats nature ``after the analogy of art.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have added that in constructing interpretations of
nature, man also applies standards that have evolved for judging
art and beauty. The mathematician J.W.N. Sullivan (who wrote an
elegant book about Beethoven's string quartets) suggested: ``Since
the primary object of the scientific theory is to express the
harmonies which are found in nature, we see at once that these
theories must have an esthetic value. The measure of the success of
a scientific theory is a measure of its esthetic value, since it is
a measure of the extent to which it has introduced harmony in what
was before chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from Kepler to Einstein have judged their theories
not just by their success in accounting for data but also by their
beauty; not just by their order but also by the kind of order they
produced. Design becomes a standard for discovery.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kepler, for example, was determined to find that the orbits of
the planets around the sun could be inscribed in the five Platonic
solids defined by the Greeks; when the data did not support this
esthetic ideal, he found something just as good: the shape of every
orbit is a perfect ellipse. If a theory's design is beautiful
enough, it can inspire allegiance even when the data seem to
disprove it. The physicist Paul Dirac famously proclaimed: ``It is
more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them
fit the experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary fascination with the artistic aspects of
science taps into these timeless concerns. But the fascination is
all the greater because the creation of natural pattern and design
has itself become a subject of exploration in genetics and computer
simulations. Arguments in cosmology, physics and mathematics have
also become so abstract that even their creators must resort to
physical and esthetic metaphors to explain them; the metaphors are,
in fact, inextricably knit into the theory. Design becomes a
standard for judging the theory as well.
</P>
<P>
   This is clear in ``The Elegant Universe'' (Norton, 1999) by the
Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, a remarkable book that
has been hailed as a classic of elegant explication. Greene argues
that contemporary ``superstring theory,'' an incomplete and highly
esoteric theory linking subatomic particles and supra-galactic
transformations, is likely to become the long-awaited ``T.O.E.'' _
a Theory of Everything that ties together every stray strand of
physics and cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the theory, Greene must link it to various images;
indeed, there is no way for scientists working in the field of
string theory to interpret their own mathematical work without
using such images. Greene suggests, for example, that with
superstring theory, ``musical metaphors take on a startling
reality, for the theory suggests that the microscopic universe is
suffused with tiny strings whose vibrational patterns orchestrate
the evolution of the cosmos.''
</P>
<P>
   There are geometric images that suggest what happens in the
theory's more exotic and invisible realms: surfaces bend and rip,
are glued and twisted. Greene even invokes ``the fine mist above
the roaring ocean'' to describe certain subatomic particles.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the design of the universe springing from the theory is
not as beautiful or as simple as the images of space and time that
unfold in the first portion of Greene's book, where Einstein's
theories are exquisitely laid out for contemplation without a bit
of mathematical complication. In fact, there is something almost
grotesque about the world conjured by superstring theory, a world
of nine dimensions in which six are curled up on themselves,
forming, in some unimaginable fashion, knotted spheres of multiple
dimensions (called ``Calabi-Yau'' surfaces) that invisibly erupt
out of every point in ordinary space.
</P>
<P>
   If such a world could be pictured, it would be considered
hideously ugly, even perverse, and unrelated to anything we
commonly understand. While Kepler was hoping to find a universe
based on Platonic solids, while African tribes might seek
elementary fractals in all aspects of human life, it is hard to
believe that anyone would seek out a universe of crabbed dimensions
and Calabi-Yau surfaces unless forced to.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be part of its beauty. In Greene's explanation, the
theory has the force of necessity. It might explain not only what
is but also why things cannot be different. Beauty is in the theory
rather than in the ornate surfaces it studies. Greene even shows
how often esthetic issues have affected the very direction of
theoretical inquiry into superstrings.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually this theory may even affect our understanding of
beauty itself. In Greene's words, its impact could be
``monumental'': we would find our world to be constructed out of
``loops of strings and oscillating globules, uniting all of
creation into vibrational patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   We would have to revise our understanding of space and time.
Perhaps, given the human fascination with natural design, we may
eventually have to imagine the possibility of superstring braids.

THE LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS: A MAGAZINE FOR THE INTELLECTUALS OF
YESTERYEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: England, Calif., N.J.) (EDS: Wendy Lesser, author of ``The Amateur'' and other books, is
the editor of The Threepenny Review, which will soon celebrate its
own 20th anniversary.) 
(DW) 
 By WENDY LESSER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anybody with enough money and connections can give a good party
celebrating a magazine; what's much more difficult is to produce a
magazine worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   On the Thursday before last, at London's monumental Mall
Galleries, The London Review of Books gave a 20th-anniversary party
for itself. There was nary a movie star or a political celebrity in
sight. This was a party for the magazine's writers, and those in
attendance included Frank Kermode, Bernard Williams, Alan
Hollinghurst and a host of other British luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Like most bookish people of my time and place, I feel stranded
in the gap between huge glossy magazines and tiny literary
publications. The former seem to care too much about a mass
audience that does not include me; the latter rarely care about
audience at all.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the mutually conversant, well-educated,
general-interest intellectuals of yesteryear? I find their
equivalent _ to the extent one can find them at all _ in the pages
of The London Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   I probably didn't see the very first issue of The LRB, which
came wrapped in the British copies of The New York Review of Books
on September 27, 1979. But by the time it became an independent
biweekly, in May of 1980, I was certainly aware of The New York
Review's younger sibling, which borrowed the American magazine's
tabloid look. The London Review of Books' founding editor was Karl
Miller; he was replaced in 1992 by his deputy editor, Mary-Kay
Wilmers, who has carried on the job ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Just as The New York Review of Books famously draws on English
writers, The London Review of Books reaches out to America. In my
own home town of Berkeley, Calif., its contributors include Thomas
Laqueur, Michael Rogin, Martin Jay and (very occasionally) myself.
On the other coast, the magazine taps Michael Wood and Alexander
Nehamas _ and that's just the Princeton contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a broad circle of people who speak to one another through
its pages, a circle that's always shifting,'' says Nehamas, a
philosopher who recently wrote for The London Review on Iris
Murdoch. `It's a journal that's serious when it needs to be
serious, irreverent when it makes sense to be irreverent, and
always witty.''
</P>
<P>
   The wit can be found even in the personal ads: for example,
``Socialist with a beard. Mid-40s. Would like to meet similar
female (facial hair optional).'' But this is trimming. What I
really like about The London Review of Books is that it preserves,
even in its lengthiest essays, the sound of the individual voice.
People who write for The Times Literary Supplement and The New York
Review of Books sound smart, informative, grammatically correct _
and, for the most part, just like the TLS or The New York Review of
Books. The very same people writing for The London Review of Books
sound like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editing is absolutely brilliant _ it's an education,''
says Adam Phillips, a British psychoanalyst whose article on Hart
Crane appears in the anniversary issue. ``And the magazine sustains
some idea of the common reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many of these readers there are is the subject of
some debate. The London Review of Books' publisher, Nicholas Spice,
sets the total circulation at 33,276 (of whom nearly 10,000 live in
the United States). `That's only about a thousand less than The
TLS,'' he proudly announces.
</P>
<P>
   But Ferdinand Mount, the editor of The Times Literary
Supplement, insists that many of The London Review's subscriptions
are heavily discounted: ``They're giving it away and we're selling
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To American readers, all this will seem like a tempest in a
teapot. After all, both The London Review of Books and The TLS have
smaller circulations than little magazines like Doubletake and
Granta. But the literary influence of The London Review can't be
measured in subscriptions alone. It's there in the literary quality
of the pieces and the responses those pieces evoke in readers; it's
there, too, in the way the magazine fosters nonfiction writers.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Bennett is widely known in Britain as a playwright. But he
is equally famous, since the publication of his collection Writing
Home, as an author of nonfiction prose. Bennett would probably not
be writing such prose if it were not for The London Review of
Books' diminutive, soft-spoken, but extremely forceful editor, Ms.
Wilmers. Bennett's unforgettable essay ``The Lady in the Van,''
about the homeless woman who lived in his driveway, first appeared
in The LRB 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary-Kay knew I'd got notes on it, so she made me write it
up,'' Bennett told me at last week's party, where he was hiding
with characteristic shyness behind his trademark brownish-gray
bangs. I turned the conversation to his delicate memoir in the
current issue, which deals with his mother's eight-year
institutionalization for depression and her lifelong fear of
seeming ``common.'' But he deflected me into a discussion of the
essay's tenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilmers, when I asked her about editing Bennett, was equally
chary of addressing content. ``It is incredibly difficult because
he doesn't have any punctuation,'' she murmured. ``A lot of writers
hear their sentences to themselves, but he's gone way beyond that.
I heard someone in the office saying, `How many commas did you put
in?'''
</P>
<P>
   Tenses and commas may seem beside the point, but they are not.
As Nehamas put it, ``Though they are willing to edit your prose,
they do not edit your thought.'' That alone, these days, seems
worth a toast or two.

   The Tokaimura nuclear plant was an accident waiting to happen
</P>
<P>
   It's the cardinal rule for any nuclear worker: never, ever bring
a critical mass of highly enriched uranium together, or you'll
unleash a nuclear chain reaction. In breaking that rule last week,
workers at Japan's Tokaimura plant triggered the world's worst
nuclear accident since Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear experts are flabbergasted that the unit did not have
built-in safeguards that would have made such errors impossible.
They also say that the plant was using a method for processing
highly enriched uranium that is inherently risky. New Scientist's
inquiries indicate that, apart from Japan, only Kazakhstan has in
recent years used a similar procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokaimura plant lies some 150 kilometers northeast of Tokyo.
The accident happened in a building, run by a company called JCO,
used for one step in the process of making reactor fuel rods. This
involves adding an oxide of uranium, U3O8, to nitric acid. The
solution is then mixed in a sedimentation tank with a solution of
ammonium salt to form a precipitate of ammonium diuranate. This is
later processed to form uranium dioxide fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The U3O8 and nitric acid were supposed to be mixed in an
elongated container _ a shape designed to prevent a critical mass
of uranium coming together before being fed into the sedimentation
tank in carefully controlled quantities. Automated checks should
have ensured that a critical mass couldn't be added in one go.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of what happened on September 30 are unclear. But
workers appear to have mixed U3O8 and nitric acid and then poured
the solution into the tank using buckets. ''The way they did this
was incredible,'' says Jinzaburo Takagi, who until 1998 headed the
Citizens' Nuclear Information Center in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   After the seventh bucket, the sedimentation tank contained 16
kilograms of uranium. At 10:35 a.m., it formed a critical mass and
started a chain reaction. Workers nearest to the tank would have
seen a flash of blue light as the air was ionized by a blast of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The first chain reaction forced the uranium apart, so it soon
fizzled out. But the critical mass later reassembled, starting
another chain reaction and releasing more neutrons and gamma
radiation. This cycle repeated several times over many hours.
</P>
<P>
   The process was facilitated by water, both in the sedimentation
tank and in the cooling jacket surrounding it. Water acts as a
''moderator,'' slowing down neutrons released by decaying
uranium-235 nuclei so that they are more likely to trigger another
nucleus to decay. The water jacket also reflected neutrons back
into the tank.
</P>
<P>
   JCO and the Japanese government have been widely criticized for
their sluggish response. Indeed, it wasn't until 2:30 a.m. on
October 1 that JCO staff initiated a plan to bring the
sedimentation tank under control. If they could drain away the
water in the cooling jacket, they realized, the reactions should
cease.
</P>
<P>
   But this proved difficult. In the end, workers rushing into the
irradiated building for just minutes at a time had to dismantle the
pipes leading from the jacket to drain it.
</P>
<P>
   The accident may have happened because workers weren't used to
handling highly enriched uranium. According to JCO, they only began
processing the material to make fuel for a fast breeder reactor on
September 22, after a three-year break.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the uranium had been less highly enriched, workers
shouldn't have been pouring it into the sedimentation tank by hand,
and the plant should have been engineered to prevent them doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ''What totally baffles me is why the technology allowed these
workers to do what they did,'' says Malcolm Grimston, a nuclear
analyst at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after previous lapses, there are widespread fears that
Japan's nuclear industry lacks a ''safety first'' culture. This may
extend to its choice of procedure for processing highly enriched
uranium. Because of the extra hazards posed by the moderating
effects of water, manufacturers such as British Nuclear Fuels now
use a ''dry'' process to prepare highly enriched uranium. It
appears that Japan and Kazakhstan are the only countries to persist
in processing the material in an aqueous solution.
</P>
<P>
   As New Scientist went to press, the two most severely irradiated
workers looked certain to lose their lives. The extent of
contamination inside and around the plant remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot eliminate the possibility of more deaths,'' warns
Murdoch Baxter, editor of the Journal of Environmental
Radioactivity. But even if nobody else dies, the name Tokaimura
will cast a long and frightening shadow for years to come.  &QL;

<P>
   A bacteria-infested yellow gel that eats through concrete could
soon be helping engineers to clean up radioactive contamination at
the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in Cumbria, England.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium, Thiobacillus thiooxidans, is one of the culprits
behind corrosion in concrete buildings and bridges. It feeds on
sulfur-containing compounds in the concrete and converts them into
dilute sulfuric acid, which eats away at any concrete it meets.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers at British Nuclear Fuels ((BNFL) and the Idaho
National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) at Idaho
Falls have found a way to use T. thiooxidans to dissolve concrete
floors and walls contaminated with radionuclides.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up old nuclear sites often involves removing
contaminated concrete _ usually a messy, dangerous and expensive
business. Workers must chip or blast away the first few millimeters
of the surface, and they can be exposed to high levels of radiation
and clouds of radioactive dust. So the researchers figured that T.
thiooxidans should offer a slower, but far safer, way to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   They mixed the bacteria with sulfur and added dollops of inert
cellulose thickener. The result is a bright yellow gel resembling
custard that can be spread or sprayed onto concrete surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Humidifiers are used to keep the humidity level around the gel
at about 95 percent, which allows T. thiooxidans to thrive and
continue churning out acid. When engineers decide that they have
removed enough concrete, the gel is allowed to dry out. The remains
of the gel and the rubble infested with radionuclides can then be
collected, sealed in concrete and stored at disposal sites along
with other radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   According to INEEL project manager Melinda Hamilton, none of the
bacteria survives the drying process, so the bug's activity should
be arrested before it chews all the way through walls.
</P>
<P>
   In lab tests at BNFL's Capenhurst site in Cheshire, England, the
mixture ate through concrete at a rate of about 1 centimeter a
year. The process isn't fast, admits Tim Milner, project manager at
BNFL. But this shouldn't matter since most contamination occurs in
the top few millimeters of a surface.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the bacteria offer key advantages over manual
techniques: the mix is cheap and easy to use. ''These critters
deliver the acid to precisely where you want it,'' says Milner.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have spent four years perfecting their custard
and as a first test, BNFL plans to put it to work at Sellafield,
England. In the next two months it will be applied to contaminated
concrete inside a walkway near the chimney at the Windscale Pile 1
reactor, where some of the contamination dates from a fire in 1957.

   A pair of artificial lips is helping to reveal why brass
instruments sound the way they do. The researchers who made the
latex lips hope they will lead to trumpets, trombones and cornets
that are easier to play.
</P>
<P>
   The physics of brass instruments are not well understood, says
Murray Campbell, trombonist and physicist in the musical acoustics
lab at the University of Edinburgh. ''You'd be surprised how little
is known about the relationship between what a brass player does
with their lips, what the instrument tries to do and the note that
actually comes out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike woodwind instruments, which have a vibrating reed in the
mouthpiece, in brass instruments a player's lips are the
oscillating device that creates the note. The lips force vibrating
air through a funnel-shaped mouthpiece into a resonant tube whose
length is chosen to create standing waves of the desired frequency
range.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between the frequencies of lip vibration,
the standing wave and the note that is sounded by the instrument is
complex, and changes in lip vibration do not produce proportional
changes in the note.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's strongly nonlinear,'' says Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure exerted on the lips by the airflow in the resonant
tube can exert note-bending forces back up through the instrument
onto the player's lips. Conversely, he says, variations in how the
lips are used can affect the sounding frequency of the tube.
</P>
<P>
   But analyzing how the lips and instrument interact requires lips
to be held in a fixed position for up to 10 minutes. And as no
player can maintain this, says Campbell, artificial lips are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts to make artificial lips out of materials such
as leather have not been very successful. The playing shape of
these lips _ known to musicians as the embouchure _ could not be
adjusted, nor could they reproduce a brass player's characteristic
''buzzing lip''.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, physicists Jokl Gilbert at the University of Le
Mans and Jean-Frangois Petiot at the University of Nantes have
created a pair of artificial lips made from two thin latex tubes.
The tubes are filled with water, says Gilbert, so they mimic the
density and flexibility of our own lips. And as air is blown
through them, it flows through a perforated plastic plate that
simulates the effect of teeth. The tension in the ''lips'' can also
be adjusted to mimic different playing styles.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gilbert and Campbell, together with their colleague John
Cullen, have undertaken a series of tests on trombones and ancient
horns _ like the Celtic carnyx _ with a new version of the French
system constructed at Edinburgh. ''It seems to work very well,''
says Campbell, who will report their early findings at a meeting of
the Acoustical Society of America in Columbus, Ohio, next month. &QL;

   Hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor release mercury into the
sea, geologists from Canada have found while analyzing samples from
vents in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   This finding raises the question about whether this ''natural
pollution'' contaminates fish. Mark Hannington of the Geological
Survey of Canada, Ottawa, and his colleagues were studying water
and rock samples gathered last year from hydrothermal vents in the
Bay of Plenty off the coast of New Zealand. Analysis of the samples
showed that the vents release mercury from sediments containing
pure mercury and mercury sulfides. The team calculates that each
hot spring releases up to a kilogram of mercury each year.
</P>
<P>
   Hannington's colleague Bob Garrett points out that these hot
springs are home to bacteria that turn mercury into its organic
form, methyl mercury, which is easily taken up by fish. ''It starts
moving up the food chain, eventually reaching the top predators,''
says Garrett. In humans, methyl mercury damages the nervous system
and in extreme cases is lethal.
</P>
<P>
   It is still unclear how much mercury from the New Zealand vents
enters the food chain. But in the 1970s, Japanese fishermen
abandoned tuna fishing in the region when fish there turned out to
contain inexplicably high levels of mercury. The mercury probably
came from the seafloor vents.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how many such springs there are worldwide and
how much mercury lies on the seafloor. ''But it could be locally
significant,'' warns Garrett.  &QL;

   Esoteric sports that were once strictly participatory have
become spectator events watched by millions. ESPN 2 covers
competitions that would once have been viewed only by nervous
friends and relatives: off-road skateboarding, sky surfing,
chain-saw championships. Web sites like Quokka.com and
MountainZone.com hook up climbers and long-distance desert runners
with digital cameras, pulse monitors and communications equipment.
E-mail messages to Quokka describe hours spent staring at computer
screens as daredevils scaled the Great Trango Tower, a 6,000-foot
sheer rock wall in Pakistan, in July.

   The newest magazine aimed at this market is National Geographic
Adventure, edited by John Rasmus, a former editor of Outside and
Men's Journal. ``We want to capture the purity of what's implied by
the name adventure,'' said Rasmus, whose National Geographic
spinoff was started in April. His pages may contain features on
``exploraphernalia,'' but Rasmus, himself a hiker and kayaker,
takes his adventure seriously. He said his magazine's approach is
``not about irony'' and is careful to refer to the Himalaya
Mountains by their local pronunciation: ``the hee-MAL-yah.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus said focus groups indicate that his audience is ``very
active'' and was reluctant to acknowledge an armchair contingent.
Hal Espen, the editor of Outside, took a more realistic view. A
recent reader survey showed that about 15 percent of subscribers
``have tried some level of fairly ambitious mountaineering,'' he
said. ``Far more than 15 percent of our readers are as fascinated
with vicariously participating in stories about mountaineering.''
</P>
<P>
   An overdue parody of the genre appeared in the men's magazine
Details in the August issue. Wil Hylton wrote of training for a
serious climb in South America by drinking and smoking beforehand
and then continuing to do so on the way up.
(OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</P>
<P>
   There are cultural antecedents for our obsession with these
kinds of stories. From the middle of the last century into the turn
of this one, an industrializing America devoured the literature of
adventure, risk and physical danger in penny-dreadful accounts of
men driven to cannibalism, the great novels of Herman Melville and
the wilderness stories of Jack London. The view of nature had
ceased to be redemptive (the Romantics' idea) and become Darwinian,
as George Stade, a professor of English at Columbia University,
observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the last century there was a fusion of adventure
with literalism and realism and London and instrument of that,'' he
said, recalling a Jack London story in which a man caught in a
winter storm kills his dog and puts his hands inside the animals'
body to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway kept the man vs. nature tradition alive long
after the rest of literature had left it to Hollywood. There is a
George Clooney movie in production of ``A Perfect Storm,''
Sebastian Junger's novel of a sailor's losing battle with the sea.
But for the most part, the current armchair adventurism has
remained a literary, not cinematic, form. Rosenthal suggested that
``people are so used to being transfixed by visual imagery, there
may be some desire to conjure things up in the mind's eye again and
put the imagination to some test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that can be tested at room temperature.

IT'S NOT THE DATE, BUT THE TURNOUT THAT'S IMPORTANT 
</HEADLINE>

   CONCORD, N.H. _ On a day when politicians and pork producers
from Derry to Des Moines were wrangling over New Hampshire's moving
its presidential primary ahead by a week, the man at the center of
the tempest fingered a 200-year-old newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gardner, New Hampshire's secretary of state since 1976,
Thursday perused a remarkably well-preserved copy of the Oct. 8,
1799, ``Massachusetts Mercury,'' with ads from merchants selling
goods off British ships, a notice promising a reward for capture of
a runaway slave woman and her 12-year old son, and Paul Revere's
notice, as Boston's first sewer commissioner, that all privvies had
to be shoveled out during October. (That must have been the first
Big Dig.)
</P>
<P>
   Henry Fredette, a collector of historical artifacts from
Fitchburg, had delivered the paper to Gardner, a bit of a historian
in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gardner is a man who takes the long view. A Democrat who's
become a local institution here, reelected regularly by the
Republican-dominated 400-member House of Representatives, it is
Gardner who is entrusted to keep New Hampshire first, if not in the
eyes of Iowa pols, then at least on the calendar of presidential
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By moving the date of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation
primary from a pencilled-in-but-unofficial Feb. 8 to an
etched-in-Granite-State-granite Feb. 1, the low-key Gardner
recently ignited a firestorm in Iowa. The move means that if Iowa
wants to keep eight days of separation between its caucuses and New
Hampshire's new Feb. 1 date, it will have to move up its Jan. 31
date. Otherwise, there'll be just three hours between when Iowa
stops voting and New Hampshire starts at Dixville Notch.
</P>
<P>
   But Iowa is not so inclined to switch. It seems that the pork
producers of the nation have reserved hundreds of hotel rooms in
the Hawkeye State to chew the, er, pork, roast the ribs, do a
tympani on the tenderloin, and otherwise wallow in hog-producer
heaven. And the moving-up-a-week schedule shift affects thousands
of caucus sites, church halls, school gyms, etc., with disruption
of plans on a vast scale.
</P>
<P>
   The shreiks and caterwauling reached such a pitch that Iowa
Governor Tom Vilsack called Governor Jeanne Shaheen to demand she
bring Gardner to heel. Some New Hampshire legislators began
harrumphing about calling a special session to strip Gardner of the
power to set the primary date, a power he has exercised deftly
since 1976. On CNN, anchor Bernie Shaw grilled Gardner, who
explained how his hand was forced by Delaware's moving its primary
forward, triggering the portion of the New Hampshire law decreeing
New Hampshire votes at least a week before any other state's
primary.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of threats, bluff, elbow-tossing, and
venting, cooler heads prevailed, New Hampshire politicians cooled
their jets, sanity reemerged, and Gardner's date stood. Some Iowans
remain miffed; people who resent New Hampshire's gatekeeper role
continue to mutter darkly in other states, but the Old Man of the
Mountain remains the starter of the presidential primary calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our secretary of state did just what he was supposed to do,''
said Senate Majority Whip Lou D'Allesandro, a Democrat from
Manchester. ``I taught Billy in the ninth grade and 10th grades at
Bishop Bradley high school in Manchester, and he knows what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not much sympathy in New Hampshire for Iowa's
discomfiture. ``They had their auction, their little tent sale,''
said D'Allesandro, making sarcastic reference to the Ames, Iowa,
straw poll last summer, where the Republican candidates dropped
between $100 and $300 for every straw poll voter they snared.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen seemed to waffle last week under Iowa's umbrage. But
after she took a quick head count, and found not enough votes for a
panic move of stripping Gardner of his authority, she scrapped the
notion. The Union Leader torched her in a Friday editorial for
``trying to take the granite out of the Granite State.'' It remains
to be seen if New Hampshire is punished down the road with fresh
attempts to dislodge its first-place pole position.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates, with less than four months to work with, just
want to get on with the politicking here. Iowa, it turns out,
should have kept closer tabs on Delaware, and phoned Gardner for
regular updates. Like the space probe that burned up because NASA
screwed up the measurements, Iowa didn't nail down the details.
</P>
<P>
   As often happens in politics, long-term trends can be obscured
by the short-term fireworks and bluster. Gardner this year
instigitated a town-by-town review of the voter registration lists,
which shows an inexorable leakage of party loyalty. Both major
parties seem to be losing their hold on voters, and the ranks of
voters eschewing party labels are growing. Here they are called
``undeclared'' voters; in Massachusetts, they are ``unenrolled.''
In the bigger world of politics, they are ``independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last November, the town of Derry lost 84 Republicans and
20 Democrats, but gained 149 ``undeclareds.'' Hudson, the only town
in New Hampshire that voted for the winners in every primary going
back to 1952, a bellwether of bellwethers, lost 46 Republican
voters and 335 Democrats since last November, but gained 235
``undeclareds.''
</P>
<P>
   And the pink sheets of updated voter registration totals
accumulating in Gardner's high-ceilinged State House office tell
Gardner this: ``I think it's pretty fair to say the `undeclared'
voters exceed either Republicans or Democrats.'' Why? It probably
reflects some disillusionment with parties, labels,
politics-as-usual. What is unusual here is the level of prosperity;
New Hampshire is richer than ever, the prosperity palpable.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not bode well for turnout. Some years, more than
80 percent of New Hampshire's registered voters will turn out, but
that's ususally triggered by hard times. Hyping turnout is the job
of the various campaigns. They should adopt the course Paul Revere
urged on Boston's privvy-owners of 1799: Dig harder!

ARISTOCRATS FOUNDED ON `MASTERPIECE THEATER' HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ARISTOCRATS 
Producers: David Snodin, Christopher Hall, Kevin Menton and Nigel
Warren Green 
Director: David Caffrey 
Starring: Serena Gordon, Jodhi May, Anne-Marie Duff, Geraldine
Somerville, Alun Armstrong and Ben Daniels 
On: Channel PBS, Sunday, Oct. 10, 17 and 24, at 9 p.m.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, ``Aristocrats,'' a historical three-part series
beginning Sunday night on PBS, represents the best aspects of its
``Masterpiece Theater'' lineage. Its detailed visual account of
aristocratic Georgian England and Ireland _ the palaces, country
homes, gilded and chandeliered interiors, elaborately layered
fashions, dining tables groaning under the weight of roasts and
glistening silver _ is stunning. And, at times, and often when it
counts, equally polished and finely wrought performances give this
chronicle of four sisters of royal heritage a robust and poignant
immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   Grandchildren of Charles II and his French mistress Louise de
Keroualle, the Lenox sisters were privileged and fascinating
creatures of a rapidly changing world. ``Aristocrats,'' based on
the widely acclaimed book by Stella Tillyard, attempts to frame
their various intimacies _ sisterly, maternal, marital, and, in two
cases, adulterous _ with epic history. Their lives were touched,
sometimes quite directly, by surging democratic philosophies and
rebellions in the colonies and in France and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   It might be helpful to describe ``Aristocrats'' as a portrait of
four strong women and numerous strange or sappy men. Of course,
there are exceptions. But, for example, eldest sister Caroline,
well-read and willful, elopes with Henry Fox, a dourly intellectual
political animal, decent but notoriously odd and, finally, publicly
despised. Prolific Emily (22 children by two husbands) originally
mates with Irish Lord Kildare, dashing and amorous, and perhaps an
exception. Emily is smart, a deeply affectionate mother affected by
the new educational ideas of Rousseau, but cautious until her
second, and socially daring, marriage. Louisa marries a dopey
nonentity of fabulous wealth. Sarah, a darling tot in Part 1 whom
bizarre King George II playfully stuffs in a huge vase, later comes
close to marrying his son, George III, pictured as blandly
peculiar. The public humiliation of her near miss leads Sarah _
sensual, needy, outrageous by the standards of the day _ first to a
union with a nasty cold fish, then a scandalous affair with a
near-nutcase, followed by exile from high society.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters' emotional lives _ the powerful relationships to one
another, to their spouses and lovers and children _ are often
evoked with sublime artfulness and urgency. At its best,
``Aristocrats'' offers us daily life as it was experienced and felt
by these extraordinary, articulate and surprisingly engaged and
candid women.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Aristocrats'' starts slowly, tilting our attention
toward its shiny production values rather than the rich human drama
they should illuminate. Except for the striking fact that many
years pass in Part 2 without anyone showing signs of aging, the
odyssey hits its stride there and in the early moments of Part 3.
Then, this multi-generational saga almost as full of begats as the
Bible, pulls the rug out from under viewers grown attached to its
dynamic main characters. Instead of cosmetically graying and
wrinkling by now familiar and generally excellent actors, the
producers disorientingly inserted new performers into several
principal roles.
</P>
<P>
   One effect is simple who's-who confusion. Worse, moments of the
finale seem like a goofy ``Saturday Night Live'' version of
``Masterpiece Theater,'' seriously diminishing but not defeating
this sweeping and sometimes spellbinding drama.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Princess Michael of Kent is coming to town, but alas,
I'm going to be in London, doing my bit on QVC,'' Kenneth J. Lane,
the costume jeweler, announced to guests assembled for lunch at his
baronial Park Avenue duplex last week.
</P>
<P>
   Formidably suave and peripatetic at 67, Lane thrives on a social
and professional schedule that would daunt the chief executives of
most companies. Determinedly debonair, self-assured and almost
absurdly well connected, Lane has long been a fixture of New York
and international high society, living the cultured, civilized life
that most people may have assumed had ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 12, Lane's 40-year career as the king of costume jewelry
will be celebrated with an exhibition at the Museum at the Fashion
Institute of Technology. Called ``Dazzling by Design: Fashion
Jewelry by Kenneth Jay Lane,'' it includes more than 500 fabulous
and beguiling fakes, arranged thematically, from chinoiserie to
Egyptomania to jeweled insects. There will be a gala benefit for
the Museum on Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   An indefatigable escort of Princess Margaret, Brooke Astor and
Nan Kempner, Lane admits to being something of a fabulous fake
himself. As long as even his oldest friends can remember, he has
spoken in the plummy, languorous tones of an English duke, an
amiable affectation that betrays little of his native Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   As Denise Hale, the Serbian-born San Francisco hostess, who has
known Lane for 40 years, said: ``What I love about Kenny, he never
changed. He's outrageous, he's charming. And you know what? He was
exactly the same when nobody knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some bumps along the road since he quit Motown
for Manhattan, including the 1994 bankruptcy of a company that
operated 20 lucrative franchise stores bearing his name in America
and Europe. But Lane seems to have relegated these to distant
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose some, you win some,'' he said airily, adding that he
now pulls in $300,000 an hour during appearances every other month
on QVC, with which he has had a contract for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his palatial apartment, a stage set for the high life
crammed with treasures from his far-flung travels, Lane's
showroom-factory in the garment district is intended for commerce,
with its worn beige carpet and ungainly Formica fixtures. It is
difficult to imagine Lane entertaining grande dames like the
Duchess of Windsor, Babe Paley, Nancy Reagan and Mercedes Bass
there, or helping Barbara Bush and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
select their ``pearls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not seem quite the place to receive the ladies,''
Lane noted, ``but nobody buys jewelry because you have a lovely
carpet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he added with a wicked grin, ``if it was glamorous,
they wouldn't think they were getting a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Coco Chanel who, in the 1920s, pioneered the notion of
creating costume counterfeits of her expensive signature jewelry
for wealthy clients to mix and match with their genuine diamonds,
rubies, emeralds and sapphires. But it was Lane who, in the 1960s,
Americanized and democratized this tradition by copying jewelry
worth tens of thousands of dollars by Cartier, Verdura and Van
Cleef &AMP; Arpels and bringing them in for under $50.
</P>
<P>
   With a potent combination of craftsmanship, design and an eye
for just the right originals to copy _ in addition to his own
persuasive charm _ Lane swiftly ingratiated himself with
influential fashion editors, notably Diana Vreeland, whose support
spurred his career. He won over the necks, wrists and hearts of
stylish women who could afford the real thing but who were equally
pleased, if not more so, to wear their ``Kennies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival costume jewelers have come and gone. Lane's longevity
would appear to be based not only on his clever copies and artful
rearrangements of original designs, but also on his marketing
skills. By gaining the devotion of first ladies, socialites and
movie stars, he has become good copy himself (magazine copy, that
is). He has also accrued a repertory of conveniently entertaining
anecdotes that he frequently trots out while hawking his wares on
QVC.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at home, Lane told the story of the Duchess of
Windsor's visiting his showroom one morning and snapping up an
elaborate ``diamond'' belt. That night, he took his mother and an
aunt to dinner at La Grenouille, where the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor were installed in the corner banquette. ``The Duchess got
up, did a little shimmy and declared, `Look at me, I'm Mrs. Kenneth
Jay Lane,''' Lane recalled. ``My mother's mouth fell open! Before
we sat down at our own table, I introduced my aunt and my mother,
and the Duke said to my mother, `Mrs. Lane, your son is ruining
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of Lane's showroom is a photograph of Marella
Agnelli, the aristocratic wife of Gianni Agnelli of Fiat, wearing a
long multistringed necklace of Indian rubies that Lane copied and
has since sold all over the world. ``Marella's always saying,
`Naughty, naughty,''' Lane said, chuckling. ``I have to confess, I
design with a photostat machine, Scotch tape and scissors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohle Yohannan, a design historian who proposed the exhibition
(which runs through Dec. 31, cheek by jowl with the Bob Mackie
show) and is one if its curators, said Lane's wide range of
influences and solid craftsmanship distinguished him from the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's heavy duty, not lightweight junk,'' said Yohannan, who
collected Lane's work for years at tag sales. ``And his pieces
allow women to play Cinderella for the night, because they have the
sparkle of good jewelry. He also makes things fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Faking It'' (Harry N. Abrams, 1996), Lane offered
readers a colorful romp through his professional triumphs. Has he
considered a more candid memoir?
</P>
<P>
   ``I might do it, if only because I've been fortunate enough to
know a lot of interesting people,'' he said. ``I knew the world in
the 50s, which was very glamorous. And I knew the swinging 60's in
London.'' Not to mention the Rolling Stones when they first came to
New York, a city he thinks is not so interesting now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking down Fifth Avenue today, I noticed it's altered quite
a bit,'' he said. ``It looks like the boardwalk in Atlantic City.''
Of course, he knows one solution: ``A bit of jewelry would
certainly help.''

can exist in other animals. Is animal behavior the result of
reasoning and choice, or is it just instinct or sophisticated
mimicry. By Dinitia Smith.

 &HT;    ATHENS, HOST TO THE 2004 OLYMPIC GAMES, PREPARES TO AGAIN BE THE
CENTER OF THE WORLD
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (s) sports and (i) international
categories
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON Jr.

<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ Francois Carrard glowered through the dim light
at the 20 or so reporters gathered in the cavernous auditorium for
a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee's director general, an
imposing Swiss lawyer accustomed to being treated with deference _
if not fear _ said something.
</P>
<P>
   But almost no one could hear him because the microphones were
turned off.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the reporters wouldn't have understood Carrard
anyway because there weren't any translators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were supposed to have the lights, technicians and
interpreters,'' Carrard said in an un-amplified apology to the
front row of foreign journalists. ``But this is Saturday night _
and this is Athens.''
</P>
<P>
   And in five years, Athens once again will be at the center of
the known world. After being snubbed in its frantic campaign to
host the 1996 Centennial Games, Athens finally has what it coveted:
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   Still not completely recovered from its bitter loss to upstart
Atlanta in 1989, Athens is a city with something to prove with the
2004 Games. At the dawn of the next millennium, Athens wants to
prove to the world that the presumptions underlying Carrard's quip
are out of date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that Greece is not just a country that lives
in the past but is a dynamic, effective, productive, competitive
place capable of organizing the Olympic Games,'' said Panagiotis
Thomopoulos, who was recently appointed president of the 2004
organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   The city's performance in staging the Games is also seen as an
opportunity for Greece to prove it is worthy of holding its own
with fellow members of the European Union, many of whom regard the
country as a junior partner.
</P>
<P>
   When the new European monetary union and single currency _ the
euro _ debuted at the beginning of the year, Greece was left
waiting in the wings because it failed to meet economic minimums
for entry.
</P>
<P>
   And while its NATO allies were happily pounding Belgrade over
Kosovo, Greece stood by wringing its hands, unable to appear
decisive because of its sympathies for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   While no one thinks a two-week sporting event will instantly
elevate Greece to the status of France, Britain or Germany, the
Olympics are seen as an important ticket to the partners' table.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the obvious challenges facing Games organizers
there is an air of complacency at the Olympics offices. Indeed,
even as reporters and IOC members who gathered in Athens last
weekend for Olympic meetings groused about the city's notorious
traffic, dodgy hotels and aura of chaos, top IOC officials were the
picture of tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge, the Belgian physician who heads the IOC's
coordination commission for the 2004 Games, told reporters he has
''no concerns whatsoever'' about the state of Athens' preparations.
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch echoed this sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, however, senior IOC members and executives
expressed much deeper concerns. The IOC late last month decided
suddenly to switch its meeting from Baden-Baden Germany to Greece
to see for itself if whether there was trouble in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   The local media _ never a friendly lot for Olympic organizers _
have fueled speculation that the organizing committee was rife with
delays, mismanagement and internal bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has endured a number of staff changes _ including
the resignation of its capable former chairman Stratis Stratigis,
who left following a scrap with the president over Stratigis' plans
to attend the wedding of a relative of the deposed Greek king.
</P>
<P>
   It is also widely speculated that Costas Bakouris, the
committee's popular managing director, is on the verge of being
dismissed, a rumor he only partially dispelled during the IOC
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The construction program has been taken over by the government,
and the organizing committee still is struggling to issue its first
serious budget for spending about $1.6 billion to stage the Games _
substantially less than the $1.8 billion spent by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even bigger problem will be finding a place to house
the spectators. Athens has about 30,000 hotel rooms of reasonable
quality _ about 20,000 fewer than Atlanta _ and about 20,000 of
those have been snapped up for IOC members, their families,
sponsors, officials and other Games regulars. There are discussions
of pulling cruise ships into the harbor, converting dormitories and
assembling private housing to accommodate spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the IOC is unconcerned, people on the street are worried
by what they see as a lack of progress. Their pride at winning is
tempered by the enormity of the challenges facing the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``So where are the construction cranes building the stadiums,''
sand Kostas Triantafyllides, a merchant selling Athens 2004
T-shirts in the touristy Plaka district. ``I'm very nervous. We win
the Olympics two years ago and then they disappear. In Athens, five
years is a blink.''
</P>
<P>
   Triantafyllides is among those who have softened their views
toward Atlanta's winning the 1996 Games. ``I didn't drink Coca-Cola
for two years after they bought the Games for Atlanta,'' he said.
``Now they buy the Games for Athens, maybe I think again.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 75 percent of the venues were in place before Athens
was selected to host the Games, the city must build an Olympic
Village to house 16,000 athletes and a few smaller venues such as
those for baseball and softball. And the organizing committee still
is undecided about where to place six venues, an issue normally
resolved much more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been late in waking up to the problems,'''
Thomopoulos, the new organizing committee chief, said last week.
``But I think now we are fully aware of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the problems that plagued Athens when it was
competing with Atlanta in the late 1980s remain today. It is still
considered to be Europe's most polluted city, although the
government says stringent controls on car usage have produced a 30
percent improvement in air quality.
</P>
<P>
   The country's perennial political instability remains, but the
country is generally regarded as settling down into at least a more
stable mode. The economy, with low deficits and inflation rates, is
performing well enough to put the country on course to become a
full member of Europe's unified economy.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh concern is earthquakes. The city was stricken by a
substantial tremor just a few weeks after the devastating quakes
that hit Turkey. A mild quake caused a rumble during the IOC visit
and raised a number of questions about whether the city would be
safe during the Games. The organizers said, more or less, that they
would do what they could but earthquakes happen.
</P>
<P>
   Athens is undergoing massive transformation, with a new metro
system that will serve much of the city opening its first large
phase before the end of the year. A new airport in the heart of the
Attican peninsula is expected to be completed by 2001 with a new
highway leading to it by the time the Games arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Work has begun on parking garages in Kolonaki Square and central
Kaningos Square _ public places now choked by cars. Eleftherias
Park is being expanded to give the sometimes cluttered city a much
needed expanse of green. Even the Parthenon is getting a face lift:
eight columns along the temple's north side will be dismantled and
reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Athens organizers are going for the kind of makeover and
indulgent attention of TV broadcasters that permanently elevated
Barcelona to join the big players in Europe after the 1992 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot compare today's Athens with Athens in 2004,'' said
Thomopoulos, referring to the improvements scheduled to come on
line before the start of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   It won't come a minute too soon for Johnny Yannakopoulos, the
most recent member of his line to hold the officer's rank at
Captain Johnny's restaurant in the seaside district of Mikrolimono.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent night, tourists strolled down the sidewalk above the
string of restaurants that sit right on the water. The air was
filled with the smell of charred fish and shrimp. Yannakopoulos was
one of the proprietors working the crowd of passers-by, tempting
them with his fresh seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Business has been lousy. ``You had the war and the earthquake,''
he said. ``The tourists canceled by the thousands and went
somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   In his view, the Olympics may be the one event big enough to
compensate for such extremes of man and nature. ``They are five
years away, but what a five years,'' he said.

   &UR; SATURDAY'S KEY GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Michigan 5-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 at Michigan State 5-0
</P>
<P>
   This is Michigan's weekly Big Ten crisis game. The Wolverine
defense has stopped everyone so far, and Michigan State's defense
ranks first in the nation against the run (42.8 yards a game). The
Spartans can move the ball, too.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia 4-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 at Tennessee 3-1
</P>
<P>
   Two good teams struggling on offense. In beating Auburn last
Saturday, Tennessee couldn't punch the ball in. After Georgia's
second straight 1-point victory, Coach Jim Donnan said, ``We were
our own worst nemesis.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 Miami 2-2
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Florida State 5-0
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick, the Florida State receiver and perhaps college
football's best player, has been suspended indefinitely after his
arrest on charges of underpaying for department-store clothing.
Still, the Seminoles have too many weapons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 Air Force (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   vs. Navy (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Raljon, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Run, run, run. Air Force ranks second in the nation in rushing,
Navy fourth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Florida (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Louisiana State (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Against Georgia, LSU couldn't run and couldn't stop the run.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 9 Georgia Tech (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   Easy for Georgia Tech's offense, the most productive in the
nation (517.2 yards a game).
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Mississippi State (5-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Auburn (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   A long day for Jeff Klein, Auburn's young replacement
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Mississippi (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   at East Carolina (5-0)
</P>
<P>
   If East Carolina wins this tossup game, an unbeaten season
awaits.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDWEST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Penn State (5-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Iowa (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   With all its perceived shortcomings, Penn State keeps winning.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 7 Kansas State (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State has the defense, and the Kansas runners aren't
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 8 Minnesota (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   This game may show if Minnesota's defense is that good.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Ohio State (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State can't be as bad as it looked in the second half
against Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 20 Notre Dame (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   In beating Oklahoma, Notre Dame's Jarious Jackson passed for 276
yards and ran for 107.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOUTHWEST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   vs. Texas (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Dallas
</P>
<P>
   Two good teams that sometimes yield too many yards and
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAR WEST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Southern California (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Arizona (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   Another tough-to-figure game in the underachieving Pacific 10.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada-Las Vegas (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 15 Wyoming (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming's blitzing defense should have little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   California (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 17 Brigham Young (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Feterik is a passer in the Brigham Young tradition.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Missouri (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Colorado (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's defense should handle this ranked opponent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MISMATCHES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Virginia Tech (4-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Rutgers (0-4)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers's Mike McMahon, tender throwing arm and all, faces the
best defense around.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (3-1)
</P>

OK, I'LL DO WINDOWS, BUT JUST THIS ONCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've heard that you can copy a file from the
Windows installation disk to your hard drive to keep a program
being installed from asking you to insert the Windows disk. Which
file do I copy?
</P>
<P>
   _ Slipped Disk
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SLIPPED: I could tell you, but it's more fun to think about
you scrabbling through all your junk CDs from AOL and Earthlink and
Mindspring, hoping against hope that you didn't toss your Windows
CD the last time you cleaned out your desk, and that, if you
didn't, it's not scratched beyond repair. No, really, I have this
great mental picture of you breaking out in a cold sweat. It's
really funny.
</P>
<P>
   But, because my therapist says that's really disturbing behavior
for a help columnist, I suppose I can let you in on the secret.
Everyone who needs this info better write it down, though, because
I'm not repeating myself, regardless of what that quack says.
</P>
<P>
   Use Windows Explorer to browse your CD and look for a folder
called Win98 (or Win95). Drag the folder over to any place on your
hard drive. It doesn't matter where. Now, the next time Windows
needs a file that didn't get installed during the original setup _
such as a network or printer driver _ and it prompts you to stick
the CD in, you'll be able to browse to the folder on your hard
drive instead. Some versions of Windows will make you type in the
directory, but it works the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the big question is why Microsoft didn't add this as an
installation option. Maybe it likes the idea of you frantically
searching your house, too.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Someone is sending out a very desirable screen
saver, the Budweiser frogs _ ``Buddylst.zip.'' If you download it,
you will lose everything!!! Your hard drive will crash and (more
apocalyptic silliness). This information was announced yesterday
morning from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Easily Hoodwinked
</P>
<P>
   DEAR EASILY: No, it wasn't. Did you even check Microsoft's
security site (www.microsoft.com/security)? C'mon, people! Never,
ever trust anything you read in e-mail, no matter who it comes
from. First of all, Microsoft is only going to announce things that
can go wrong with its own products. Second, if you want information
about any potential virus, go to somebody you can trust, like
Symantec (www.symantec.com/avcenter/hoax.html) or McAfee
(www.mcafee.com).
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I am forwarding this because the person who
sent it to me is a very good friend and does not send me junk.
Microsoft and AOL are now the largest Internet company (blah, blah,
blah). When you forward this e-mail to a friend, Microsoft can and
will track it. For every person that you forward this e-mail to,
Microsoft will pay you $245 and (more ridiculous tripe).
</P>
<P>
   _ Get Rich Quick
</P>
<P>
   DEAR RICH: That loud sound you just heard was me slapping my
forehead. Microsoft and America Online are pretty close to being
mortal enemies. That should be your first clue. And Microsoft
doesn't give money away without years of nasty litigation. Stop
spreading this fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm very disappointed. In fact I'm almost as depressed as those
actors in the Gap commercials, although I believe their depression
is rooted in the fact that A.) they're too old to be playing
teen-agers; B.) they lack sufficient hand-eye coordination to comb
their hair; and C.) they have to wear those clothes.
</P>

BIOGRAPHY TELLS A LOT ABOUT LADY BIRD JOHNSON, BUT NOT THE FULL

   ``Lady Bird''
</P>
<P>
   By Jan Jarboe Russell
</P>
<P>
   Biography
</P>
<P>
   Scribner, $26
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   When author Jan Jarboe Russell sat face to face with Texas' most
revered first lady, she asked how the widow of Lyndon Baines
Johnson had endured her husband's well-known indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a legitimate, if indelicate, question. Lady Bird had a
quick, cold answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people ask me these sort of things,'' she said, ``I just
say, `Look to your own lives. Look to yourself, everybody. Fix
yourselves, and keep your problems to yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   That answer sets the tone for this biography. It gives notice
very early on that the former Claudia Alta Taylor isn't about to
spill any personal or political beans; that she has spent a
lifetime protecting her family from public scrutiny, and this
effort by Russell will probably not get past her guard.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   We get a brief look at Lady Bird before there was a Lyndon in
her life, but only a brief one. The majority of this book is really
a biography of two people and their lives together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to separate us and our roles in each other's
lives,'' Lady Bird once wrote to Russell. The author agrees,
calling this biography ``a love story. A book about a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird was raised by her Aunt Effie Pattillo, a prototypical
Southern spinster, following the death of Lady Bird's mother in
1918. Effie was a dreamer, a delicate flower, with infirmities that
forced her to live her life vicariously through her young niece.
She wanted the strong-willed Bird to become a journalist for The
New York Times perhaps, or maybe The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   If not a journalist, then a ballerina.
</P>
<P>
   But Bird's father, Thomas Jefferson Taylor, was the richest man
in Harrison County. He got that way by working hard and dreaming
little. He wanted his daughter to stay in the small East Texas town
of Karnack where she was born, and work in the family business.
</P>
<P>
   The opposing forces accounted for Lady Bird's pragmatism at the
University of Texas at Austin. She graduated cum laude with degrees
in history and journalism, but also earned a teacher's certificate
and learned how to take shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   She had, already, learned to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   But she was far less practical when she met a tall, outspoken
U.S. congressional aide named Lyndon Johnson on a blind date on
Aug. 1, 1934. Within days, he was daring her to marry him. Within
months, she did.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a storybook romance, but it was an enduring one that
cast LBJ in the stark, ugly light of an oppressive husband, and
Bird in the shadowy darkness of the oppressed wife.
</P>
<P>
   That was not entirely true, not entirely fair.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was brutish at times. He often mocked his wife in front
of others, scolded her for her looks, dressed her as though she was
his own personal toy. But, Russell also notes, there were times
when he was tender and loving. Times when he needed her strength.
Times when he could not go on without her.
</P>
<P>
   In the deeply dark days of the John F. Kennedy assassination, it
was Lady Bird who breached the cavernous gap between the Kennedy
and Johnson camps. She mothered the stricken Jackie Kennedy. She
tutored LBJ through the quarrelsome meetings with Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she and Jackie remained distant, but gracious and
friendly to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird was often compared with Eleanor Roosevelt, another
strong first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleanor was also a motherless child. Lady Bird lost her mother
when she was 5 years and 9 months old, and Eleanor's mother died
when she was 8,'' Russell points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were also similarities between the two women's
marriages. Both of their husbands were unfaithful, and both women
endured the betrayal by looking the other way and becoming involved
in inspirational projects that had the effect of lifting them out
of the depths of their own private misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird clearly had the business brains in the Johnson family.
While LBJ could wrangle a bill through Congress, she could squeeze
dollars from a failing radio station in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   She built a communications empire for her family, one that
financially fed her husband's political ambitions and provided for
her own independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lady Bird was no frail Southern flower like her beloved Effie.
She was _ and is _ strong, passionate and forever a Texas icon,
revered and loved for her graciousness and civility.
</P>
<P>
   It has, as Russell points out, been a difficult road for her.
She fought to keep her marriage intact, and decades after LBJ's
death, she continues to fight to keep her life with her husband
private.
</P>
<P>
   And she prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years,'' Russell writes, ``the way Lady Bird would
sustain herself in the hard periods of her marriage was to perform
a solitary, private ritual. When she was alone, at night or in the
early morning, she would take out her Episcopal prayer book, read
the vows, and recommit herself to love Johnson. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``She trained herself not to think about or notice whether he
was honoring his vows.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A decade ago, when Nissan gave birth to its Infiniti
luxury division, the baby's future seemed clear: Infiniti was
destined to be the BMW of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The other new luxury brand of 1989, the Lexus division of
Toyota, copied Mercedes-Benz. Lexus cars had a similar vault-like
feel and cocoon-like isolation; the big LS400 even looked like a
big Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   But Infiniti's first car, the Q45 sedan, had distinctive styling
along with the kind of exhilarating performance that had been the
forte of BMW. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, Infiniti drifted from the high-performance
concept, and its place in the market grew hazy. The styling became
more conservative and predictable, and Infiniti emblems appeared on
pedestrian cars that were sold as Nissans overseas. The
second-generation Q45 seemed watered-down. It had a smaller engine,
smaller dimensions and, yes, a smaller price.
</P>
<P>
   Customers took note of this less-is-less formula, and Infiniti
suffered. While Lexus sales doubled in 1995-98, and Honda's luxury
division, Acura, gained 15 percent, Infiniti had an increase of
just 8 percent after some roller-coaster years. With Nissan in
financial trouble, Infiniti's future was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are signs that Infiniti is taking baby steps to
recapture the territory it staked out a decade ago. The latest
evidence is the 2000-model I30, the second generation of its
midsized car. The I30 is smooth and polished, it performs well, and
it holds its own in a very competitive class.
</P>
<P>
   The first I30, introduced in 1996, was a Band-Aid over a gaping
hole in Infiniti's lineup. Sales of what the industry calls ``near
luxury'' cars _ sedans priced in the low-$30,000 range _ were
growing quickly. Indeed, this is still the fastest-growing segment
of the car market.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti used the Nissan Maxima's drivetrain and body, grafted
on its own grille and rear end, dressed up the cabin and added
insulation to lower the noise level. The resulting car was pleasant
but hardly a standout.
</P>
<P>
   Although that car used much of the Maxima's sheet metal, the new
I30's body shares only its basic shape and roof line with the less
expensive Nissan. The styling is still unlikely to turn heads _ but
few cars in this class do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the I30 looks better in subtle ways. I appreciated this
most when I saw a previous-generation car parked near my
millennium-jade test car. The old car looked more boxy and plain;
the 2000 model has sweeping, more elegant lines; more steeply raked
glass, and more dressy taillamps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new I30 is 4 inches longer and 2 inches wider, and the added
size is evident inside. The cabin feels airy, with a particularly
spacious back seat. The trunk is among the largest in the class, at
14.9 cubic feet, and the split rear seats fold for cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti wants to establish that the I30 really is a luxury car.
The base model has been discontinued; leather upholstery is now
standard. Inside, only the glove box is shared with the Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel has been revised, with perfectly placed
controls that are larger and easier to use. It is still a
conservative design; some competitors have come up with more
contemporary dashboards, even gauges that look like holograms. The
centerpiece of the I30 dash is a gold analog clock with delicate
hands; that clock, an Infiniti signature, was unwisely dropped in
the second-generation Q45, but executives say it will appear in all
Infinitis from now on.
</P>
<P>
   All four windows can be raised or lowered with a single touch of
a button. There are five cupholders and a foot parking brake.
</P>
<P>
   The new I30 continues to use the front-drive architecture of the
Maxima, which was also redesigned for 2000. Both are powered by
Nissan's smooth and powerful 3-liter V6, an engine that often
appears on the lists of the world's best.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The I30 comes only with an electronic four-speed automatic
transmission; the five-speed manual was dropped for lack of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Modifications have raised horsepower by 37 from last year, to
227; the I30s engine was tweaked to produce 5 horses more than the
Maxima's. Because the I30 is heavier, though, and its gearing is
different, the Maxima is actually quicker. Torque has increased by
12 foot-pounds, to 217.
</P>
<P>
   The car accelerates briskly, and though the interior has been
quieted further by thicker window class, one can still hear the
engine's pleasant guttural tone. A stiffer body and suspension make
for more responsive handling and enhanced safety. The brakes have
been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
   The I30's safety equipment includes antilock brakes, four air
bags, active front head restraints that move to prevent whiplash,
and seat-belt pretensioners that take up slack in a collision.
Traction control, standard on many competitors, costs $300 extra.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features include air-conditioning; a Bose stereo
with CD and cassette players; power windows, mirrors, locks and
seats; remote locking; automatic headlights and fog lights. The
I30t _ for touring edition _ adds Xenon headlights, larger wheels
and tires, a firmer suspension and quicker steering, memory
settings for the seats and auto-dimming mirrors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One cool feature, literally, is a power sun shade in the rear
window, like those in high-end cars like the BMW 7-Series. It is
optional on the base model for and standard on the I30t. It keeps
direct sunlight off rear-seat passengers, reduces the cabin
temperature by as much as 9 degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Infiniti Communicator, a sophisticated communications system
that uses cellular phone technology and Global Positioning
technology, is a $1,599 option. It connects the car to a 24-hour
response center similar to General Motors' Onstar that can provide
help in emergencies and offer travel information.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of Infinitis is generally above reproach, and the
test car was no exception. The engine is excellent, tried and true.
Infiniti's pampering dealerships are rated among the best in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   The base I30 model starts at $29,990 and the touring edition is
$32,065. A fully equipped car would run about $35,000. These prices
are roughly the same as the original I30 of four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Infiniti's closese competitor, the Acura 3.2TL, may
be a better deal. Acura offers similar package of
performance-oriented luxury for $28,855, very well equiped. Even if
hou add on the Acura's only factory option, a $2,000 navigation
system, the TL costs less than the I30.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with its predecessor, the I30 has more horsepower,
more interior and trunk space, more features, more distinctive
styling. That is the formula Infiniti plans to use on future
models.
</P>
<P>
   These include a restyled, more powerful QX4 sport utility that
arrives in March. (The next-generation QX4 will have an even larger
engine and seating for eight.) A new Q45, which goes into
production next year, will have more than 300 horsepower and
distinctive styling.
</P>
<P>
   The small G20 sedan will trade its four-cylinder engine for a
V6. And Infiniti executives promise to take on the very popular
Lexus RX300 with a new sport utility that will have ``the spirit of
a sports car.''  &QL;

 &HT;    If willpower doesn't exist, why do some people eat vegetables?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Scientists who study weight loss have concluded
that there is no such thing as willpower.
</P>
<P>
   I'm no scientist, but I beg to differ despite the fact that I
haven't invested a single minute on the study of willpower.
</P>
<P>
   If the scientists are right, then they have spent perhaps years
studying something that isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I have spent no time studying this subject.
So who's smarter?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magical stuff inside of you called willpower that
should somehow override nature,'' Dr. James C. Rosen, a professor
of psychology at the University of Vermont, told the New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently the scientists have been searching for something they
could weigh, measure or analyze.
</P>
<P>
   I see willpower more as mind over matter, when your mind gives
in to temptation no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when confronted with a bag of soft-baked
Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chunk cookies sitting on a supermarket
shelf, I can either buy the cookies or not. It's all a matter of
willpower.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to really like these cookies. But if I had willpower, I
would not buy the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I know that a 14-year Harvard study of 76,000 female
registered nurses and 39,000 male doctors and other medical workers
found that the risk of stroke was cut by nearly a third among those
who consumed a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than buy a bag of eight big soft-baked Pepperidge Farm
Chocolate Chunk cookies, I should push my shopping cart over a few
more aisles and load up on kale, bok choy, collard greens, brussels
sprouts and broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   I know this.
</P>
<P>
   I consider the Harvard study and also recall the repeated
admonitions of my mother and several wives regarding my need to eat
more vegetables. I drop a bag of the cookies into my cart.
</P>
<P>
   I am not a female registered nurse, nor am I a male doctor or
other medical worker.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, I've always suspected that the women in my life
were just trying to cut their grocery bills. I can't recall when
they suggested that I eat something more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery store items that are green and cheap as grass likely are
close grass relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what the weight-loss scientists say, my purchase of the
Pepperidge Farm cookies is proof that I lack willpower. Other
shoppers see the same cookies and keep going. That proves it
exists.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the Pepperidge Farm cookies, a few aisles over
I'll fill flimsy plastic bags with kale, bok choy and brussels
sprouts. Weeks later I'll dig this slimy mulch out of my
refrigerator's vegetable bin and regret my lack of willpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willpower was a kind of all-embracing theory that was used all
the time to make doctors feel good and patients feel bad,'' Dr.
Albert Stunkard, a professor of psychiatry at the University of
Pennsylvania told the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Stunkard, who has been studying weight loss for five decades,
must be old. ``Willpower doesn't have any meaning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It means something to me. Confronted with some temptations, I
have amazing willpower. With others, I have none. I think everyone
is the same.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when tempted to experience pain, I invariably
display an energetic determination to resist. More often than not,
I succeed.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with a slice of fresh-baked apple pie, I have no
willpower.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than try to disprove the existence of something that
obviously is there, scientists should find a way to manufacture
more of it.
</P>
<P>
   Once it has been bottled, sort of like Pepto-Bismol, people
could take quick swig when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Just before grocery shopping would be a good time for a shot of
willpower. More willpower might even solve the world's
overpopulation problem.

   `Love &AMP; Money' not worth your time
</P>
<P>
   By Kevin D. Thompson
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Pop quiz: You're a network programmer. Some hotshot writer
barges into your office with this premise: Rich girl is about to
marry rich guy. But rich girl really loves poor guy. Rich girl
dumps rich guy for poor guy. Rich girl's snooty parents aren't too
keen on poor guy. Let the yuks begin.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   Shoot him, of course.
</P>
<P>
   That premise is as dated as rabbit ears. But CBS hopes to milk
as many laughs as it can out of it in ``Love &AMP; Money,'' yet another
routine sitcom. Are fresh ideas really that rare in Hollywood? They
must be, because we've seen this comedy over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Conklin (Paget Brewster) is a well-to-do socialite who's
about to marry some Princeton grad who bought her a $45,000 ring.
The problem is, she's in love with Eamon Roach (Brian Van Holt), a
former hockey player who toils as a super at Allison's high-priced
New York City apartment building. The guy actually _ gasp! _ lives
in the basement with his gruff dad (Brian Doyle-Murray), who looks
like former New York Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell Allison and Eamon (what kind of name is that?) are
from different worlds. She wears fancy Vera Wang wedding gowns. He
wears moderately priced tool belts from Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   While Allison and Eamon are cute, so are cocker spaniels. There
isn't much hot chemistry between them, either. And that includes
when they're making out in a freight elevator in next week's
episode. It doesn't help that both Allison and Eamon look like
they're in the third grade.
</P>
<P>
   The most laughs actually come from David Ogden Stiers and
Swoosie Kurtz, who play Allison's super-rich folks. Kurtz is
particularly funny as the martini-guzzling mom. But even those
characters are strictly one-dimensional and cartoonish. And so is
this show.

 &HT;    `X-Files' creator plunges viewer into murky new `Realm'
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITALIC)War . . . what is it good for? Absolutely nothing.(END
ITALIC)
</P>
<P>
   Well, don't tell that to Chris Carter. Despite what Edwin Starr
sang on War, his 1970 top-10 single, Carter knows that war can be
good for one thing on television: telling dramatic stories. That's
why ``The X-Files'' creator is using it as a backdrop for ``Harsh
Realm,'' his intriguing, though maddeningly murky, sci-fi series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harsh Realm'' is a typical Carter show. There's a sinister
government conspiracy at work. The tone is dark and brooding.
There's a dense mythology, and nothing is what it appears to be.
``Harsh Realm'' actually refers to a top-secret virtual-reality war
game designed during the Cold War to simulate various combat
scenarios. The game was supposed to be scrapped after the Cold War
ended, but Harsh Realm had other ideas as it took on a life of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do a TV show that had elements of some
of my favorite movies, 'Paths of Glory,' 'Platoon,' 'Blade Runner'
and a lot of really good early war movies,'' says Carter, who based
the show on an obscure '90s comic book with the same title. ``I was
affected by 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'The Thin Red Line.' This was
an opportunity to take some of the things I liked best about those
movies and use some of the elements of virtual reality to create a
really good science-fiction show.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen, however, how good ``Harsh Realm'' will
be. Tonight's opening episode is definitely intriguing and leaves
you wanting more. Scott Bairstow (''Party of Five'') stars as
Thomas Hobbes, a be-all-you-can-be type of Army lieutenant. After
seeing some of the horrors of war in Sarajevo, Hobbes decides it's
time to settle down with his fiancee, Sophie (Samantha Mathis). But
the government has one more job for him to do: test Harsh Realm and
find a rebel soldier named Santiago (''Millennium'''s Terry
O'Quinn).
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``it's just a game,'' Hobbes is told.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than that. Once inside, Hobbes finds that the game
is very real and that he can't get out. It's a world in which there
are no rules, no God and no mercy. It's a world in which people
evaporate when they die, so, as Carter notes, ``there is no
reverence for the dead.'' Hobbes is forced to form an uneasy
alliance with a veteran soldier named Pinocchio (D.B. Sweeney), who
believes the young lieutenant can save all the virtual characters
stuck in the Realm.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say ``The Matrix?''
</P>
<P>
   Hobbes learns that Santiago actually hijacked the program and is
using the game to create his own kingdom. He also discovers that
his fiancee is another character who doesn't know him in this
parallel universe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Harsh Realm'' is basically a metaphor for
totalitarian states. ``I wanted to take a godless world where there
is no morality, where there is no standard or code of behavior and
see what the world would be like if it were like that,'' he says.
``That gives us a chance to comment on society and certainly on a
lot of contemporary issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter has a lot riding on this series. Hollywood insiders are
already whispering he may be a one-hit wonder. Remember, the always
dreary ``Millennium'' flopped miserably. It doesn't help that ``The
X-Files'' is entering what will probably be its last season. Carter
has hinted, however, that he may develop a series starring ``The
Lone Gunmen'' characters.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Harsh Realm is Carter's chance to prove he can do more
than ``The X-Files.'' But if ``Harsh Realm'' is going to succeed,
Carter must create characters viewers care about and he can't
afford a drawn-out mythology that yields little answers. That's
what sank ``Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The always candid Sweeney, however, doesn't think Carter should
give away too much too soon. ``If it's pat, if everything's
answered for you, like the way it was in the ``Dharma &AMP; Greg''
pilot, I don't know why you'd want to watch the show.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll probably want to watch the second episode, just to figure
out what the heck is going on. Why is the government still
operating Harsh Realm? What impact does the virtual world have on
the real world? Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Can
Hobbes get his fiancee back?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question is, will it all work?
</P>
<P>
   Carter thinks so. ``This has a tremendous love story and has a
great mythology potential as well,'' Carter says. ``I think this is
a great chance to tell allegorical stories.''

 &HT;    Oh, Rats! How to keep your house from being a rodent haven this
season
 &HT;    (EDS: Rat facts and tips on keeping rodents out are at the
bottom of this file.)
 &HT;    By Amy Kincheloe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Fall is here and you could be getting some
unexpected houseguests _ and that's not a reference to the annoying
family members who show up around the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   These unwanted guests are rodents, which include rats, mice and
squirrels, and they often like to hole up in your home during the
fall and winter months.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Jones, owner of Ladybug Termite and Pest
Control, the Waco area is already experiencing a rodent problem,
and some of it is drought-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their instincts are kicking in, and they're looking for winter
nesting spots in and around the home,'' Jones said. ``Rats and mice
are bad in the rural areas like China Spring right now. In Waco
proper, squirrels are living in attics. They're looking for
moisture, warmth, a hiding place for safety and food.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Poche, owner of Genesis Laboratory in Fort Collins,
Colo., which has specialized in pest control research for the past
30 years, said mice and rats are looking for an area to nest where
they normally won't be disturbed by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll go under the stove, the refrigerator, under the sink,
the attic,'' Poche said. ``They're looking for a dark, warm area.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said rodents get into homes through small holes and
cracks. Poche added that mice can squeeze through areas as small as
a nickel, and rats can squeeze through areas as small as a
half-dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Once in your home, rodents can be very destructive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been known to chew through lead pipes to get a
drink,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Poche said rats and squirrels can also chew through wiring,
which can lead to fires.
</P>
<P>
   Rodents are unhealthy guests to have living in your home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry diseases, they carry fleas and they leave waste,''
Jones said. ``Their hair is also unhealthy _ it can cause people's
allergies to act up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control, hantavirus, a lung
disease, is carried by rodents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the disease is rare, it is easy to contract, according
to the CDC. Hantavirus is contracted primarily by inhaling airborne
particles from rodent droppings, urine or saliva left by infected
rodents or through direct contact with infected rodents.
</P>
<P>
   Poche said good sanitation is the first step to keeping rodents
out. He advises putting your pet's food and water up at night and
storing the food in metal or thick plastic containers with
tight-fitting lids. Also, clean up debris in and around the home.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in keeping rodents out of the home is ``excluding
them with entry,'' Poche said.
</P>
<P>
   He advises putting steel wool in cracks and holes in the
exterior of the home.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing he advises is an old-fashioned method.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use good snap traps,'' Poche said. ``Place them along the
walls, because rodents tend to follow along the walls. Also, bait
the trap with peanut butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Poche said rodents like the smell and taste of peanut butter and
it also takes more of an effort to eat it off of the trap, giving
the trap more of a chance to catch the rodent.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Poche recommends using baits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep EPA-approved baits out,'' Poche said. ``Place them in
cabinets, under the sink, under the workbench, behind the stove,
and under the refrigerator. But place them where kids and pets
can't get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Poche said when it comes to rodents, be proactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't wait until you see one, because if you see one, you
usually have more lurking behind the scenes,'' Poche said.
</P>
<P>
   MOUSE AND RAT FACTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The U.S. Food and Drug Administration destroys approximately
400,000 tons of food yearly that is contaminated by rodent
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   _ As frequently as every three weeks, rats can bear eight to 12
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   _ The teeth of rats are harder than iron and their jaws can
exert pressures of 24,000 pounds per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rats can swim up to a half of a mile and tread water for up to
three days.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fear of mice is the third most common fear among
Americans, right behind fear of public-speaking and fear of going
to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   _ While rodents do carry many diseases, contrary to popular
belief, rats are not a common transmitter of rabies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mice are the ``rabbits of the rodent world'' _ a single pair
of mice can produce descendants numbering 15,000 in one year. In
just six months, one pair of mice can deposit as many as 18,000
droppings.Mice have been a pest to man for thousands of years and
they will probably continue to coexist with us for many more. Since
rodents may be able to smell nuclear fallout, they may even outlast
humans.

</P>
<P>
   KEEPING CRITTERS OUT
</P>
<P>
   _ Seal up potential entrances to your home _ Using sheet metal,
steel wool or concrete, seal up any holes larger than one-quarter
inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove items that are potential nesting sites _ Remove stacks
of newspapers, storage and cardboard boxes from
</P>
<P>
   shelves and floors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep high risk areas, such as garages, attics and storage
areas, free of accumulated litter _ Mice are attracted to
undisturbed areas within the house and in and around stored
objects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food and garbage storage _ Keep all food, water and garbage in
metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting lids. Never
leave food and water out overnight.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a clean house _ Wash dishes and cooking utensils, and
clean spilled food from counters and floors immediately. Also,
dispose of any trash and clutter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use rodenticides _ Keep a supply of baits and traps on hand
and use them regularly as a preventative or to stop a little
problem from becoming an infestation. In addition, use
EPA-registered rodenticides, such as bait pellets, on an ongoing
basis inside the home.

 &HT;    GORE FIGHTING TO AVOID A REBUFF AT AFL-CIO CONVENTION
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, Oct. 10.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore faces an uphill battle this
week to win the endorsement of the AFL-CIO labor federation and
avoid another blow to his struggling presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho, scheduled to arrive here
Sunday for last-minute negotiations with the federation's leaders,
said the rules at its convention make it difficult for Gore to win
an endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote of the convention's 700 delegates is required.
And while former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's only
opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, may not have
enough support to win the endorsement himself, he might muster
enough votes to block the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get two-thirds, and all Senator Bradley has to get
is one-third to stop us,'' Coelho said in an interview. ``So the
odds are weighted against us. But we're working hard. We feel
good.''
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney is reluctant to force an
endorsement on his organization, even though he has sent signals
throughout the year that he favors Gore. His top lieutenant,
Richard Trumka, marched at Gore's side in a Labor Day parade in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney also is determined not to allow recent electoral
gains by organized labor to be jeopardized by a lackluster effort
in next year's election, which will determine control of both the
White House and Congress, and ultimately the balance on the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   A united front is what the labor leader hopes to achieve when
representatives of the federation's 68 unions gather here Monday
for their three-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that includes an endorsement of Gore ``boils down to
John Sweeney and whether he will push it through,'' said Mike
Mathis, political director of the teamsters union.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has banked dozens of union endorsements in recent weeks in
an effort to pry an endorsement out of the AFL-CIO. On Friday, he
got the biggest yet from the National Education Association, the
nation's largest teachers' union, with 2.8 million members.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, who has surpassed or pulled even with the vice
president in some state public opinion polls, has furiously lobbied
union leaders to hold off endorsing anyone before the first voting
in Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Some powerful union leaders were already arguing in favor of
delaying the AFL-CIO's endorsement, most notably James P. Hoffa,
president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who began his tenure earlier this year by declaring that
the Teamsters ``will not be an ATM machine for the Democratic
Party,'' has raised concerns that the administration-backed North
American Free Trade Agreement will open the Mexican border next
year to low-wage truckers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, following a private meeting with Hoffa in New
York on Thursday, promised to prevent any changes in NAFTA trucking
rules until Mexican trucks meet U.S. safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor has largely objected to the free trade policies
of the Clinton-Gore administration. But Bradley, too, is a
free-trader, and his voting record in the Senate on union issues
was virtually the same as Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   It helps Gore with unions that the economy under the Clinton
administration has produced the lowest unemployment in 29 years.
And the administration has delivered on such issues as family
leave, a rise in the minimum wage, education reforms and tax
credits for low-income working families.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's lackluster performance thus far in his pursuit of
the 2000 Democratic nomination has given some labor leaders doubts
about bestowing the AFL-CIO's blessing so early in the nominating
process. An endorsement this week would be the earliest the
federation has intervened since 1983, when it backed Walter Mondale
in the midst of a tougher-than-expected primary challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is just too early in the process,'' said
Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's endorsement would help Gore make the case that his
campaign is rejuvenated, ready for the challenge not only from
Bradley but from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the GOP
front-runner. For the convention to end without the long-sought
endorsement ``would be a setback'' for the vice president, said
David Axelrod, a Democratic consultant with ties to Gore and the
union federation.

 &HT;    GORE FIGHTING TO AVOID A REBUFF AT AFL-CIO CONVENTION

   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore faces an uphill battle this
week to win the endorsement of the AFL-CIO labor federation and
avoid another blow to his struggling presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho, scheduled to arrive here
Sunday for last-minute negotiations with the federation's leaders,
said the rules at its convention make it difficult for Gore to win
an endorsement.
</P>

GARDENING: LESSONS AT A SCHOOL WHERE THE WORM CLUB RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 10)  
 (bl)  
 By ANNE RAVER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Worms seem unlikely ambassadors for a troubled world,
but they were popular members of the after-school garden club I
helped start last year at Public School 15 _ the Patrick Daly
School, named for the principal who was shot while searching for a
pupil seven years ago _ in Red Hook, Brooklyn. These worms were
teaching us to be good stewards of the earth, until their ecosystem
crashed _ due to their own global warming, I think _ but we're
going to try again.
</P>
<P>
   Our club is small: about 10 kids, fourth- and fifth-graders, and
four grown-ups, though sometimes the grown-ups act like kids and
vice versa. We started out last fall, planting bulbs in the
school's central courtyard, which had a forgotten, overgrown look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to this school, and I never knew this was here,'' said
Enily Mieles, a volunteer for the Americorps program, standing
under the drifty branches of a weeping white birch. We gather here
every Thursday after school to weed, and prune and plant things.
Half the time we just look at stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Like catkins dangling from a hazelnut tree. Or the empty shells
of the nuts discarded by the squirrels that ate half our tulip
bulbs last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that!'' shouted Mercedez Delgado on one clear, chilly
afternoon, opening her arms to a sugar maple ablaze with orange
light. We looked up its name _ ``Acer saccharum'' _ in our tree
book, and noticed how the shape of the leaf is different from that
of A. rubrum, the red maple. Then somebody, who will remain
nameless because he repented, smashed a worm. ``Why did you do
that?'' I asked, deadpan. He shrugged, grinning. His pals giggled.
</P>
<P>
   So, we talked a bit about what earthworms do, like churning and
aerating the soil, and how red worms, another species, could turn
our garbage into gold for the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Hill rolled his eyes, as if I were kidding, which is his
favorite activity. But the next week, I brought in two pounds of
red worms from the Lower East Side Ecology Center, along the East
River in Manhattan, where worms turn garbage to compost. And that
afternoon, Lower East Side worms began eating Red Hook garbage _
chopped up lettuce, carrots and the like _ and making compost for
our garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should call ourselves the Worm Club,'' Desmond said,
as we got the worms' habitat ready: shredding newspaper and
sprinkling it with water, tossing it like spaghetti into a rubber
bin about the size of a laundry basket. The worms like it damp, but
not too damp.
</P>
<P>
   We weighed their first meal: old lettuce, coffee grounds,
eggshells, banana peels and cantaloupe rind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worms love melon rind,'' I told them. ``But they don't like
cabbage. It's hard to digest, so it sits in the box and starts to
smell.'' So, it's best to stay away from cabbage and onions, and
meat, of course, which attracts critters other than worms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worms are nasty,'' Mercedez said, giggling happily.
</P>
<P>
   Questions tumbled out: If you cut a worm in half, will it die or
grow into two worms? Do worms have bones? Eyes? Teeth? Blood? How
long do they live? ``Does a worm go through an aging process,''
Jesse Horenstein asked, ``like being a baby, and then a kid, and
then a teen-ager?''
</P>
<P>
   And how do they mate? (Or marinate, as Luiz Miranda asked, which
is apt, because they lie there, two together, with this slime
wrapped around them.) We watched ``Wormania,'' a video made by Mary
Appelhof, a biologist and worm-maniac in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could remember the word ``hermaphrodite'' _ something to
do with being male and female at the same time. But if a worm has
both eggs and sperm, why didn't it make its own babies?
</P>
<P>
   Harriet Chichester, the school's science teacher, gave a talk on
genetics. Luiz turned philosophical. ``I think if you made your own
babies, you'd never get to know anybody,'' he said. ``Even if you
went to heaven, you wouldn't know anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a scary thought. But to get back to the
nitty-gritty, if a pound of worms can eat a half-pound of garbage
in one day, how much can two pounds of worms eat? A wave of math
anxiety washed through the room, until Michael Pagan, staring
solemnly at the ceiling, intoned, ``one pound.'' We weighed out a
pound, and put it in one corner of the bin, which has plenty of air
holes. Then we sprinkled handfuls of worms over the shredded paper
and watched them wriggle away from the light (worms hate light)
toward their first meal.
</P>
<P>
   By then, even Mercedez was holding a worm in her hand. Desmond
named his new friends Kevin, Josh and Frank. However, Ms.
Chichester, who screamed when she first held a worm, asked me to
keep the bin at my house, and to bring it back on Thursdays. Over
the weeks, the kids fed them and looked at them under magnifying
glasses _ to find their ``five hearts,'' or circulation system; the
clitellum, or band through which they exchange sperm; the egg cases
that look like gold beads.
</P>
<P>
   Then, all of a sudden, something went haywire: most of the worms
died. Maybe we gave them too much food, or water, or not enough
newspaper, or maybe my apartment got too hot. So, I dumped them in
the composter in my backyard (where a few survivors have apparently
procreated big time). And this year, we'll try again, with
Christina Datz Romero, the compost queen on the East River, as our
worm coach. It's a can-do club: Luiz says we're going to solve New
York's garbage crisis.

   THIS WEEK: THINK ABOUT THE NEXT DRY SUMMER
</P>
<P>
   By PATRICIA JONAS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Even a wet fall will not reverse the drought's effects on
foliage. That makes this a perfect time for unsentimental
evaluation: which plants did you water all summer and yet are
bedraggled?
</P>
<P>
   Unless they're at water's edge, fringe tree (Chionanthus
virginicus), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia) and queen of the
prairie (Filipendula rubra) might not belong in a garden with water
restrictions in summer. Look for plants that tolerated the drought
and thrived, like native bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) and
witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), rugged Rosa rugosa, hybrid
epimediums and penstemons, and free-flowering bush clover
(Lespedeza thunbergii).
</P>
<P>
   Finish planting trees, shrubs and perennials by October's end,
so that roots can establish before the ground freezes hard. Pull up
spent annuals, but don't dig tender bulbs or tubers for storage
until foliage is blackened by first frost (nutrients are being
stored till then).

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains are possible Saturday over the Ohio, Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys as a slowly evolving low pressure system
draws a steady, uninterrupted stream of moist air northward from
the Gulf of Mexico. Given the available moisture and the
sluggishness of the system, the risk of flash flooding will rise in
areas where repeated downpours produce rainfalls in excess of two
inches. Behind the system, clouds will linger across parts of
Oklahoma and northern Texas, with spotty showers and isolated
thunder affecting a few areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, dry air will rush eastward on the heels of a
cool front across the eastern Great Lakes into upstate New York and
western New England. The sky will clear during the day, with
clearing eventually commencing along much of the New England
Seaboard as breezes from the west dry on descent from the
Appalachians. Showers with the front will end over Maine before the
sky starts to brighten later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the northern and central Plains will bask in
unseasonable warmth, though a cool front will tamp down
temperatures across eastern Montana and parts of North Dakota.
Behind the cool front, showers will develop over parts of Idaho's
Bitterroot Mountains as relatively moist Pacific winds impinge on
west-facing slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Southwest will be rather hot as a sprawling pool of
warm air centered over the deserts of southern California and
southeast Arizona holds steady. Unseasonable warmth will extend to
the southern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Copious Rains &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an inch of rain fell in Colorado Springs on Thursday.
This raised the tally for 1999 to 26.17 inches, exceeding the
previous record for a year of 25.43 inches set in 1965. With nearly
three months remaining, it is certain that this record will
increase. The average annual rainfall is 16.24 inches, based on the
most recent 30 years. This year has been unusually wet in Colorado
Springs for a variety of reasons. Upslope rainstorms have been
frequent as were the late-day thundershowers this past summer. It
will be several days before showers return to this region. &QL;

POWERFUL EXPOSE REMINDS US `THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quick glance at 17-year-old Miranda shows a sensitive girl
aching for simple goals in life: to be happy and healthy, educated
and successful, to love and be loved. But as ``The Children Are
Watching'' unfolds, little is simple when it comes to her life.
</P>
<P>
   Designed as a kind of ``Scared Straight'' for grown-ups (it's
courtesy of the same producer, Arnold Shapiro), this special
report, airing at 9 p.m. CDT Sunday on PBS, exposes how parents'
bad examples have often-unintentional, but highly destructive,
effects on their children's behavior and life choices.
</P>
<P>
   Four families are featured, and the hand-me-down behavior is
made quite clear as cameras zero in on their everyday lives,
including a five-hour bathroom tussle between a father and teen-age
son over a drug test. Before it's over, there's a huge hole in the
bathroom wall and the son is declaring hatred for the father who
has re-entered his life. ``I want you to die,'' the teen-ager sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with subjects and therapists, along with generic
commentary from narrator Jane Seymour (don't let this throw you off
or lower your expectations), help put the stories in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda, for instance, is a pretty girl disgusted with the
number of men her mother brings home, sleeping with them even after
they've become physically and verbally abusive. Miranda watches
these situations play out like a bad dream from which she can't
awaken. No wonder her teary mother (Nina) is both concerned and
frustrated that her daughter ``has a lot of negative thoughts about
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why Miranda is in a clingy, self-destructive
relationship with a teen-age boy. Jesse looks nice enough, but in
one scene, Miranda finds drugs and throws him out, even as she
questions whether she can go on living without the guy. He returns,
of course, and resumes his nightly sleepovers in Miranda's bed.
</P>
<P>
   Nina won't object because her daughter is happy when Jesse is
around and suicidal when he isn't. ``She took some scissors and
slashed up her arms the last time he said he'd leave her,'' Nina
says, shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   But Miranda's choice is a carbon copy of the ones made by her
mother, who is needy, insecure and a terrible judge of character.
We learn that Nina was abused by her mother, who, not surprisingly,
also had a terrible track record in choosing men.
</P>
<P>
   The same mother-to-daughter pattern emerges with 14-year-old
Antonette, who is going through anger therapy to keep from smacking
her younger siblings in fits of rage. But is it her fault she's
been saddled with helping raise them as her parents spend all their
time running the beeper service store they own?
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Vanessa, has her own sordid history. She was sent to
jail on drug charges when Antonette was 2, and after she got out,
resumed a life with many men (there are four other children, most
with different fathers). She talks to them all in an angry, almost
growling tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how she does with me, now,'' Vanessa says of Antonette,
looking disgusted at the thought. ``Even her voice inflections are
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The special also looks at a well-educated, middle-income family
and how they deal with a father whose aggressive driving and macho
behavior are passed down to his son (the son nearly causes a car
accident while speeding in his new sports car, and then balks at
the thought of atoning for his actions). And it examines what
happens when an estranged father re-enters the life of a son who
spent his formative years with a drugged-out mother. ``I see hatred
in his eyes,'' the father says, almost surprised. Why should he be?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Children Are Watching'' pushes the rather common-sense
notions that our children basically become what we raise them to
become, and that we're not spending enough time with them. And when
we do, their needs are second to our own.
</P>
<P>
   This report puts faces on what will become even more of a
concern as we continue our harried quest to obtain more, bigger,
better, to the detriment of our kids. Yet we're shocked when they
shoot up schools.
</P>
<P>
   Something can be said of parents who work like mad to, they say,
provide for their children, forgetting that time is far more
valuable than a new Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how many parents actually think about how their
behavior _ from something as simple as handling a dispute in a
retail store to running a red light because no police are around _
is processed by impressionable young minds.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Children Are Watching,'' the adage of actions being louder
than words is serious stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Also worth watching this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' (9 p.m. CDT Sunday, ABC) _ Well, well. Look
who's back. Judge Kittleson (Emmy winner Holland Taylor) drops her
gavel _ not to mention a few other things _ in a, well, revealing
episode, that also includes threatening notes, illegal handguns and
chloroform. See to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear America: So Far From Home'' (6:30 p.m. CDT Thursday, HBO)
_ Tells the story of Mary Driscoll (Laura Bertram), an 18-year-old
Irish immigrant in 19th-century Massachusetts, where she works at a
textile mill in the hope of earning money to pay for the passage of
her parents. This is another installment of the splendid historical
series for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' (9 p.m. CDT Thursday, NBC) _ Alan Alda arrives for his
guest stint as a newly hired physician with legendary credentials
in emergency medicine. Rebecca De Mornay made her entrance last
week, showing that the producers of TV's No. 1 series aren't
sitting around waiting for the drama to get stale. Good move.

   PARIS _ Michael Kors' affection for the jet set, whether in Palm
Beach or St.-Tropez, might have produced the most hilariously
atrocious results (tiaras in the afternoon, white mink in the
cabana) if this American designer weren't such a practical dreamer.
</P>
<P>
   In his version of St.-Tropez glamour _ ``Jennifer Lopez meets
Jackie O,'' as he put it before his spring show for Celine on
Thursday _ the ideal woman wears a white denim jacket instead of
mink. But she still has fun. Her mile-high stiletto mules are made
of ultra-tacky Lucite. ``She's got energy, she's got ...'' Kors
said, looking for the right word as he stood amid the preshow chaos
backstage. He seemed to consider a few more buzzwords, then waved
them away. ``Enough with depressing fashion, right?'' he said.
``Time to crank it up!''
</P>
<P>
   So he did, sending out a smart collection of American sportswear
separates enlivened with French glamour. There was Giselle in an
aqua leather jean jacket, a clingy white tank top, and tight denim
pants that looked tie-dyed but were, in fact, bleached. Kors caught
the upbeat, feminine mood sweeping through the French collections,
which end on Saturday, as coolly as Marc Jacobs had in his Louis
Vuitton show. For Kors that might mean cute cashmere tops,
chrome-studded bathing suits and sarong skirts, or maybe a shirt
dress in bleached aqua suede that evoked passing clouds in a summer
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the old Gene Kelly ``American in Paris'' story, but
both Kors and Jacobs have made the most of their deals with LVMH,
the French luxury conglomerate. They have found a way of mixing
their American sensibility for clean sportswear with French kitten
glamour, chiefly by drenching their shows with great, over-the-top
accessories. Kors had the biggest beach bags around. But, as he
said of his Jennifer-meets-Jackie prototype, ``She's not traveling
light.'' In other words, she's still a big spender.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as seven or eight years ago, when Ann Demeulemeester
was making those sensationally plain dresses and aprons that served
as a kind of refuge from 1980s materialism, and Martin Margiela was
projecting a similar bunker mentality through recycled clothes, you
could see how the avant-garde was digging into the establishment.
It was one of those us-against-them things that have always
flowered in Paris. But with this difference: the new style was
coming from Belgians, who hadn't been on anyone's radar.
</P>
<P>
   But now that many of their ideas, like fraying hems and
thrift-shop chic, have been absorbed by the mainstream and no
longer shock, the avant-garde has hit an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Margiela seemed to be mocking the fashion world's preoccupation
with labels and proportions in his show, presented on Thursday on
round tabletops in a room that looked set up for a Rotarian dinner.
For one thing, he had his models wear the kind of clothes you'd
find in a budget department store _ a loose-fitting men's jacket
over a white cotton shirt, a navy sweatshirt over a white slip, a
haggard-looking trench coat that a guy running for the 5:45 train
to Greenwich might be dragging after him.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the models' shoes all had the heels hacked off, and
some of the clothes had green price stickers or antitheft sensors
on them. Apparently, among young people, walking around with a
plastic sensor hanging from your jacket is considered a status
symbol, announcing that you'd ripped off the system.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was all very amusing to look up at clothes that you
wouldn't pay attention to for half a second if they weren't at a
fashion show. But Margiela's point was too obvious, besides being
heavy with condescension. He needs to think of something new to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Demeulemeester has kept a very individualistic approach, and
her show on Wednesday evening in an old church was beautiful, with
models in white shirts and low-slung trousers that were often
veiled with black tulle. Yet even Ms. Demeulemeester seemed stuck.
Inspired once again by the poetry and style of Patti Smith, she
took lines from a poem that Ms. Smith had recorded for her show's
soundtrack and had them embroidered on the tulle or strips of bias
tape that wrapped around the models' arms.
</P>
<P>
   Between the fragmented lines and Ms. Smith's reading, the show
seemed overwrought with significance. There is scarcely anything
more for Ms. Demeulemeester to say about Ms. Smith's outlaw-poet
style (the white shirt, black pants business) that doesn't
compromise her own integrity. The long black aprons printed with
Jim Dine's black-and-white photographs of birds were a better
marriage of art and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Prada show, which swept the runway clean of
ruffles and precious adornment, it's been impossible to look at
girlish peasant dresses with gathered necklines without thinking
they look dated. That was the trouble with Peter Speliopoulos'
collection for Cerruti. There were many pretty elements, like short
cotton skirts and sleeveless tops sprouting with embroidered
flowers or striped with rows of buttons or shells. But even though
the Riviera lavenders and greens were enticing and the cuts
feminine, Speliopoulos seemed out of step with fashion's pendulum.

 &HT;    Audrey Santo: Healer, miracle worker or saint?
 &HT;    By Doug Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ When Linda Santo was pregnant with her fourth
child, she didn't pray her baby would become a doctor or a movie
star or a millionaire. She prayed she would give birth to a saint.
</P>
<P>
   Now she knows how difficult raising a prospective saint can be.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Santo hasn't sat down to a home-cooked meal, played on a
jungle gym or proclaimed, as she often did, ``I'm gorgeous,'' since
she was 3 years old. She has been in bed for 12 years now, with a
feeding tube in her belly and a nurse by her side to make sure she
doesn't choke on her own spit.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1987, Audrey fell into the pool in her back yard
and floated face down in the water long enough for most of the
cells that formed her consciousness to die. The doctors called it
massive hypoxia. Only her brain stem was left intact.
</P>
<P>
   And while the brain stem keeps her lungs inflating and her heart
pumping, Audrey has, according to Dr. Edward Kaye, the pediatric
neurologist who treated her for six years, probably not had a
conscious thought since she was pulled from the water. And she
probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   Her life is circumscribed by the pink and lace of her bedroom
and dozens of pictures of Jesus and Mary and the Apostles. She is
15, her skin alabaster and unblemished, her long, dark brown hair
carefully gathered at the crest with a white ribbon. Her hazel eyes
move back and forth, seemingly seeing nothing. Her mouth is open,
her tongue lifeless, her brow soft and warm and still.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the translucent, yellow oil that has been
dripping from religious statues in the Santo home for years, if it
weren't for the blood that appeared on the communion wafer and the
stigmata that have risen like red welts on her hands and feet and
forehead, Audrey Santo would probably be another anonymous file in
a government social welfare cabinet. A sleeping beauty who will
never wake up.
</P>
<P>
   But something is happening at the Santos' _ either very
sophisticated fraud or highly supernatural phenomena. One or the
other, either/or.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people have chosen to believe it is God
working through a little girl. The result: Audrey Santo has been
canonized, if not by Rome, then by the faithful and the desperate
who travel the world seeking miracles from intercessory spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Day in and day out, the pilgrims come to this mostly Jewish
middle-class neighborhood believing the prayers Audrey's mother
sent to heaven 15 years ago were answered.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Santo is a tiny woman _ 4 feet, 11 inches _ and like a lot
of small women, she never seems to stop moving. She tucks her legs
underneath her in an overstuffed arm chair, then rearranges them a
moment later. She begins telling a story, gets up to pick at a
Halloween bowl of candy corn and starts again.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to her daughter is not so mysterious, really,
Santo explains. God is using Audrey as an instrument to get our
attention. We live in a throwaway society where death is pervasive:
executions, abortions, homicides, suicides. Audrey is telling the
world that, even though she's not a cheerleader or president of the
French Club, she is useful. Her life has meaning. God does not make
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audrey,'' Linda Santo declares with authority, ``makes people
uncomfortable.'' That, in the end, is her destiny.
</P>
<P>
   And if ever a ``victim soul'' were born into an ideal family,
this would be it. Stephen and Linda Santo have four children and a
marriage grounded in faith. It wasn't always that way. Stephen is a
blue-collar worker with a past his neighbors whisper about. After
his youngest daughter's accident, he walked out on all of them. He
returned a few years later, drawn back, he has said, by his wife's
strength. And there is Linda, who once studied to be a nun but
married at 18, and who says of her belief: ``Very Catholic, very,
very Catholic. The whole nine yards.''
</P>
<P>
   There are nominal Catholics, and there are devout Catholics, and
there are Catholics who breathe their Lord. Count Linda Santo among
the latter. Everything in the Santo home speaks to her devotion.
Jesus will never desert Linda Santo _ his likeness is on virtually
every wall, his words embroider almost every pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed Audrey would be a saint because I can give my child
life, but I couldn't give her eternal life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no self-righteousness to Linda Santo. She may be
a baptized Catholic, but she was born a townie, a product of an old
mill city an hour's drive west of Boston that calls itself
``Woostah'' and revels in the Yankee virtues of provincialism and
self-deprecation.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Santo simply knows what she knows: God is in her house,
and her daughter is in God's hands, on his lap, whispering in his
ear. Proof is not a problem. In a garage transformed into a chapel,
cream-colored walls are stained with the same clear, yellowish oil
that drips from paintings of the Last Supper and the Virgin Mother.
Statues of the crucified Christ have plastic cups attached to them
to capture the oil that flows from his eyes, his ears, his hair.
</P>
<P>
   When Audrey fell into the family's above-ground pool, her mother
screamed in blind panic. Gigi, a sister, flew down the stairs. Her
brother Matthew leapt frantically into the water. Acknowledging the
cynicism and disbelief of the outside world with her smile, Linda
Santo is steadfast in her belief of what happened: Audrey's soul
rose to heaven and she had a job interview with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew pulled Audrey out of the water. The EMTs resuscitated
her. The doctors drugged her. The therapists massaged her. But
Audrey never regained consciousness. It didn't matter, Linda Santo
says.
</P>
<P>
   Little Audrey had answered yes to God, she would be his child.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church is not as sure as Linda Santo. It has
traditionally been slow to acknowledge claims of the supernatural
or even to investigate them for fear of lending credence to the
claims. When the church does investigate, most claims fall apart
under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, on the 10th anniversary of Audrey's loss of
consciousness, some 5,000 people crowded the football field at Holy
Cross College in Worcester to attend Mass _ and see Audrey, resting
in her specially-made air-conditioned glass box. The miracle on
South Flagg Street could no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester Bishop Daniel Reilly commissioned an investigation.
Released in January after 14 months of study, the church report
says, in part, that Linda Santo is doing God's work by caring for
her daughter with such devotion. It also says there is no evidence
of either miracle or fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more technical and in-depth investigation began a few
months ago, but investigators are not allowed to discuss their work
until they have finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to play the devil's advocate,'' said Worcester
Diocese spokesman Ray Delisle. ``We are not out to deify her, we
are here to dig deeper into this issue and try to account for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before Audrey could be considered to take a step toward
official sainthood _ which requires the candidate to have been dead
for five years _ it would have to be proven she has some cognitive
powers. To be an intercessor and speak to God on a supplicant's
behalf, she must be aware of the requests, Delisle said.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey's family and friends are certain she is aware of
everything that goes on around her. But proving that to the
satisfaction of the church remains tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kaye, the neurologist who treated her: ``She has very
little cognitive or thought processes. It's a possibility (she can
hear people), but I never saw any evidence that she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is happening in the Santo household started in 1991
when oil started dripping from a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
Panicked, Linda Santo called the Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a
family friend whose daughter had overdosed on Tylenol and was saved
by the miraculous intercession of Edith Stein, according to the
church. Stein was later canonized because of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is an Eastern Rite priest; he has 13 children and the
practicality of fathering a family that large. He's 58 and believes
the paranormal circuit can do as much harm as good. When he arrived
at the Santo home, he pulled the frame off the painting and looked
for any evidence of tampering. He found none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her if this is from God, he'll let you know. If it's
not, don't worry about it,'' McCarthy said. Despite his own
skepticism, McCarthy _ who has had sinus problems for years _ said
the smell of roses was pervasive. Roses are the sign of Our Lady of
Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that people are going to this house and
they come away not with a yes or a no, but with a good feeling, a
feeling of faith,'' McCarthy said. A few weeks after McCarthy saw
the oil on the painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe, blood appeared on
an image of St. Rita of Cascia at the Santo hom then, one
after another, religious paintings and statues began to weep and
bleed. Eventually, the reports of the supernatural grew to include
virtually everything in the Catholic repertoire: stigmata on
Audrey, bleeding communion wafers, statues moving by themselves,
the Virgin Mary appearing in clouds.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there is the oil _ which has been tested several
times. Published results have varied. Some labs have shown it to be
chicken oil and corn or soybean oil. Others have said it contains
``unidentifiable'' elements.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its content, cotton balls are dipped into it, tucked
into plastic baggies and given to the faithful. Much to the
distress of the church, the oil is often called holy and has been
used to treat everything from cancer to shingles.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you might say, ``Aha! They sell the oil, the
money trail starts here.'' But no one has been able to document
that any money is passing hands. Books and videos are sold at cost,
and volunteers around the house work for free. A small bucket in
the corner of the garage/chapel accepts donations, which are used
to care for Audrey (the state pays for the nurses).
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, who have had to deal with traffic for years, are
cynical. Some believe the family is exploiting Audrey for profit.
Others marvel at what they see as the gullibility of the pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess people have so much faith that they can't help
themselves,'' said Bill Kennis, who has lived on South Flagg Street
for 35 years. ``But I'll tell you this, she's not going to cure
cancer. She's not going to cure a broken foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lines grow. The waiting list is more than a year. A
small bureaucracy has been erected around Audrey. Journalists are
asked if they have any anti-Catholic sentiment before being allowed
to see her. Several have been denied access. But Linda Santo turns
no pilgrim away.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need this,'' she says simply.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the routine was simple: Pilgrims would
arrive, often in buses from out of state, and be taken first to the
chapel, then to a window cut into the wall in Audrey's bedroom. A
blind would be opened, and for five minutes the faithful would
beseech, pray, drop to their knees, rub their rosaries, cry.
Occasionally, the terminally ill were allowed into the bedroom to
touch Audrey.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Audrey is no longer displayed for her public.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were cutting up pieces of the rug, the grass, the
towels, anything to take with them,'' said Mary Cormier, who moved
from New Hampshire two years ago to be a full-time organizer at the
Church of Little Audrey, which is formally called the Apostolate of
a Silent Soul, Inc. ``It just got too much.'' Many are like Valerie
Kroeft, who came from North Carolina to pray for her brother-in-law
in June of 1997 after she heard about Audrey. Her brother-in-law
had had a tumor removed from his brain, and doctors said they
couldn't remove it all. It was malignant, and he surely would die
by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two ways to live your life, Albert Einstein once
said. Believing everything is a miracle _ or nothing is. Kroeft and
the tens of thousands who have traveled from as far away as South
America to the Santo home have all chosen to believe in miracles.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester was not a first for Kroeft. She has been to Conyers,
Ga., to hear Nancy Fowler relay messages from the Virgin Mary. She
has been to Jerusalem and seen Jesus walk with the Cross. She has
seen miracles. She has felt God.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have faith, God is going to (take care of) you,''
Kroeft said. ``You have to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroeft's brother-in-law is cancer-free and has survived more
than two years, though he said he isn't sure if God saved him.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Kroeft knows. She said her prayers. She made a
pilgrimage to see Audrey. She has no doubts. It was a miracle.

 &HT;    Commentary: Ventura can't wrestle religions to the matBy Steve
Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura claims that organized religion is a sham. As a
former professional wrestler, he knows a great deal about bogus
organizations. But, as governor of Minnesota, he cavalierly
dismisses what is arguably the most powerful force on earth. Still,
he could be right.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, religious belief is a gamble. Organized religions
ask the faithful to bet their lives on the power of a God who
cannot be empirically tested.
</P>
<P>
   But if, as Ventura insists, organized religion is a placebo,
most human history is built on a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evil done and most of the good that men and women
have accomplished is rooted in religious traditions Ventura
ridicules.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed his disdain for religious institutions in an
interview published in the November issue of Playboy magazine. He
called them a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Ventura joins a long list of characters who have
unwisely dismissed the power of organized religion. Among them,
Karl Marx called it the opiate of the people. Comedian George
Carlin always gets laughs ridiculing the church.
</P>
<P>
   But the naysayers substitute the buffoonery of television
evangelists for the blood-drenched witness of saints.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, religious institutions are often cowardly and
wrong-headed in catering to the very culture their God would
transform. But many, if not most, of the world's great reformers
were unapologetic for their profound religious belief.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims bravely sailed to this land to forge a new nation
in which they might practice their faith in an organized manner.
John and Charles Wesley raised the consciousness of 18th-century
England and America to an active concern for the poor. They started
the Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the head of an
organized religion in South Africa, was instrumental in defeating
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. found strength to fight for
civil rights through his belief in the God preached from the
pulpits of organized religion. He and countless others paid with
their lives for a faith Ventura calls a crutch.
</P>
<P>
   Their commitment to the promise of another world gave them the
courage to change this one. They challenged the power structures of
their day through the power of the God Ventura belittles.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Stalin also ridiculed organized religion. Warned against
offending the power of the pope, Stalin cynically asked how many
military divisions the pontiff had at his command.
</P>
<P>
   He had none, of course. But many believe Pope John Paul II was
largely responsible for the downfall of communism in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For him and millions of others, the God of organized religion is
not a crutch but a backbone.

FORD INTRODUCES DRASTICALLY REDESIGNED TAURUS FOR 2000

   It was a case of back-to-the-drawing-board for vehicle designers
at Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a drastically redesigned Ford Taurus for 2000, part
of an all-out effort to recapture the momentum this car lost when
it received a radical redesign in 1996.

   You might recall that until the redesign, the Taurus was
America's best-selling car, an honor the vehicle had won several
years in a row. The original Taurus, introduced in the mid-80s, had
a cutting-edge design for the U.S. market, with its flying-wedge
shape (not original, but borrowed from an Audi sedan).
</P>
<P>
   That design worked for more than a decade. Taurus dominated the
midsize sedan segment, beating out challenges from the Honda Accord
and Toyota Camry. General Motors never came close with its midsize
products, including the like-sized and like-priced Chevrolet
Lumina.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Ford redesigned the Taurus, giving it another
cutting-edge look, almost like something from another planet.
Accented by a strange oval rear window that decreased rearward
visibility and rear-seat head room, the car's popularity dropped.
</P>
<P>
   People either loved it or hated it; there appeared to be no
in-between. Many stalwart Taurus owners of the past, people who for
the most part aren't into radical changes in their lives, stood
back and blinked at the new design and bought something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taurus owners are the quintessential good neighbors, people
who pay their bills on time,'' Rick Crossland, brand manager for
the new Taurus, said at a recent media program to introduce the
2000 model. As salt-of-the-earth folks, they really aren't into
anything radical.
</P>
<P>
   To come up with the latest design, which looks modern but not
radically so, Ford asked former Taurus owners and other potential
buyers in focus groups what they would like to see changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `How do we need to change the car to appeal to you?'
said Dave Marinaro, chief program engineer for the 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting product, which does away with the oval rear window
(which actually underwent an emergency modification for 1998 to
make it much-less radical looking), comes closer to the marketing
goal for cars that are intended to sell in high volume. They
``delight the few and attract the many,'' said George Murphy,
Ford's general marketing manager. He believes the new Taurus will
delight more than a few, however, on its way toward attracting the
many.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the current Taurus hasn't led the midsize
segment, it hasn't been a slouch in the marketplace. It's No. 3
behind the Camry and the Accord, and it posted its best August
sales in the brand's history this year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans a December launch for the 2000 Taurus, which goes
into production next month. Prices haven't been announced yet, but
expect to see them almost identical to last year's. For 1999, base
prices ranged from $17,560 to $19,560.
</P>
<P>
   Although underneath, the 2000 Taurus is still much the same,
there are 900 new parts. ``We touched nearly every piece of the
car,'' Marinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, the only parts that carry over from 1999 are the
windshield and the doors.
</P>
<P>
   Changes include larger headlights and a wider grille opening; a
higher and wider rear deck lid, with larger taillights; and a
traditional rectangular rear window.
</P>
<P>
   Body-panel revisions have made the car look bigger, but it's
more than an illusion. The car is taller and wider than before, and
it sits on larger wheels and tires (16 inch wheels are standard).
Rear head room has increased 1.9 inches, and front head room is up
nearly an inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective for the surface detailing was simplicity and a
straightforward nature,'' according to Ford press literature
describing the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there are new seats, a new instrument panel, new door
panels with six map pockets, and redesigned consoles. The car can
seat five or six people, depending on whether the front seat is a
bench or two buckets. The rear seat comfortably holds two adults
and a child, or three children.
</P>
<P>
   A first for a passenger car are the power-adjustable brake and
accelerator pedals. If you have short legs, you won't have to scoot
the seat up toward the dashboard just to reach the pedals. With a
push of a button, the pedals can be raised to bring them closer to
your feet. Ford also has introduced this feature on some of its new
sport-utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The changes aren't all visual. The car has been redesigned to be
safer than before (even though last year's model was the only sedan
under $20,000 to earn a top five-star rating in both frontal- and
side-impact crash tests).
</P>
<P>
   Front air bags are standard, but optional side air bags are
offered to help protect the driver and front passenger in a
side-impact crash. This is an option previously offered only on
luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   There is an emergency trunk release inside the trunk, so anyone
who is accidentally (or otherwise) trapped in there can get out
without help. Energy-absorbing interior trim helps lessen injury
during a crash, and the armrests are designed to collapse in a side
impact to absorb energy and protect the occupants. Child-seat
tether anchors are provided above the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The new Taurus comes in two trim levels: the base LX and the
uplevel SE. There also is a wagon version, offered only in the SE
trim.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine is a 3.0-liter Vulcan V-6 with the standard two
valves per cylinder, rated at 155 horsepower and 185 foot-pounds of
torque. That's up from 145 horsepower and 170 foot-pounds of torque
last year.
</P>
<P>
   To boost performance, consumers can choose the optional
3.0-liter Duratec engine, which uses four valves per cylinder to
crank out 200 horsepower and 200 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Standard is a four-speed automatic transmission with overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Taurus is fun. It feels rather sporty for a family
sedan when equipped with the Duratec engine, and the car has a
solid feel in tight turns on curvy roads. Ride is smooth and comfy,
but not overly cushy. Steering response is excellent, which gives
the driver a good sense of control.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk is larger and has a more usable shape. And in keeping
with the vehicle's intended use as a family car, Ford has installed
hooks inside the trunk to hang plastic grocery bags on so the
groceries don't spill all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 17 miles per gallon in the city and
26 mpg on the highway for the Duratec engine, and 20 mpg city/28
highway for the base engine. The tank holds 16 gallons of gasoline.

`FELICIA'S JOURNEY': A SURREAL AND SUBTLE THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To call Atom Egoyan's surreally atmospheric screen
adaptation of William Trevor's novel ``Felicia's Journey'' a genre
movie would be a little like describing ``Moby-Dick'' as a fishing
manual.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Trevor's insidious thriller about a lost Irish
girl adrift in England's industrial Midlands and the homicidal
catering manager who ``rescues'' her has epic pretensions. It's
that Egoyan, Canada's most gifted filmmaker, brilliantly bends this
Gothic-flavored fable to express his own tricky cinematic vision.
</P>
<P>
   That vision, to put it a bit grandly, is the contemplation of
human fate in a universe that throws out tantalizing portents of
meaning and purpose while paradoxically appearing to be absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of Felicia (Elaine Cassidy), a young woman who
travels across the Irish Sea in search of the man who impregnated
her, and Joseph Hilditch (Bob Hoskins), a stout, beady-eyed
bachelor whose head swirls with '50s pop kitsch, represents a
bizarre collision of two self-enclosed universes.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia's world, which we glimpse in flashbacks (the movie is
continually roaming around in time), is a dreary working-class
existence redeemed by her schoolgirl passion and her naive faith in
a lover who departed without leaving an address.
</P>
<P>
   In her quest to find him (she mistakenly believes he works in a
lawn-mower factory), Felicia suggests a modern-day equivalent of
one of Thomas Hardy's solitary pilgrims traipsing across a
magnificently bleak industrial landscape. Ms. Cassidy captures the
character's youth and determination with a convincing mixture of
vulnerability, blankness and a kind of stubborn radiance.
</P>
<P>
   Where Felicia's emotional world is defined by mournful Irish
ballads and by Kate Bush's throbbing recording of ``The Sensual
World,'' Hilditch surrounds himself with the syrup of Mantovani and
tinny sentimental ballads like ``My Special Angel,'' a song that
assumes a creepy resonance as the movie goes along.
</P>
<P>
   A fastidious head chef in a factory, Hilditch returns each night
to his large empty house with its gigantic, gadget-filled kitchen.
Here he prepares elaborate gourmet meals under the videotaped
supervision of his dead mother, Gala (Arsinee Khanjian), who used
to be the host of a French cooking show and whose programs he
reruns obsessively while cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Egoyan directs these scenes for a slightly ghoulish, campy
comedy. The music is garishly tacky, and the cooking show a funny
parody of '50s-style ersatz French chic. In video flashbacks, we
see the chubby preadolescent Hilditch dragged onto the program by
his unflappably ebullient mother, who dispatches him on minor
chores (which he invariably muffs) and feeds him morsels (which
make him gag.)
</P>
<P>
   Here and elsewhere (especially a startling moment in which
Hilditch gazes conspiratorially into the camera), we have the
feeling of being toyed with in the same way Alfred Hitchcock
delighted in tweaking film audiences with little pranks.
</P>
<P>
   As Hilditch, Hoskins _ who has specialized in crude, ruddy-faced
blokes _ reins in his bluster to give a remarkably restrained and
compassionate portrayal of a repressed middle-aged mama's boy with
a streak of psychopathic violence.
</P>
<P>
   When he first encounters Felicia in a chance meeting in his
small green car, he appears to be a good Samaritan helping out a
woman in distress. But even here, there are subtle warning signals:
The character is a little too intent, a little too carefully
spoken.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, like the book, teases us by withholding information.
It isn't for a while that we learn Felicia is not only lovelorn but
pregnant. Although we suspect that Hilditch may be up to no good,
his violent history is leaked only gradually. Videotaped fragments
(they're either memories or actual tapes, the movie doesn't say) of
conversations in his green car with grateful young women he has
befriended and helped begin punctuating his thoughts. As their
gratitude shades into terror, it becomes clear that they are his
murder victims. But the movie never shows his actual crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the story threatens to turn into a predictable
cat-and-mouse game in which Hilditch lures the innocent Felicia
into a lethal trap, the movie throws in a Bible-thumping
missionary, Miss Calligary (Claire Benedict), who shelters Felicia
after she has been robbed.
</P>
<P>
   At first Miss Calligary appears to be a stock movie caricature
of an obnoxious religious proselytizer. But in the film's
transcendent final scenes, she appears as a vehicle of fate,
another rescuer, whose disturbing mixture of the crazy and the
benign mirrors that of Hilditch.
</P>
<P>
   In exploring notions of fate, chance, coincidence and timing in
people's lives, ``Felicia's Journey'' has many of the same
preoccupations as ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' Egoyan's 1997
masterpiece, which examined the reactions of a tightly knit
community to a tragic school-bus accident that took the lives of
many of the town's children. Burrowing into the town's grieving
soul, ``The Sweet Hereafter'' posed deep, anguished questions about
blame and liability, faith and causality in human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicia's Journey,'' which closes the New York Film Festival
on Sunday evening, is a smaller film, restricted by its genre and
by the limitations of its two main characters. Neither the
tight-lipped Felicia, who is locked in her own romantic dreams, nor
Hilditch (who may not even remember his crimes) is emotionally
accessible in conventional screen terms. That's one reason the
movie occasionally loses its grip and appears to be an immensely
clever exercise in genre expansion.
</P>
<P>
   But once viewed, ``Felicia's Journey,'' like most of Egoyan's
mature work, is hard to forget. Visually and in its soundtrack of
overlapping voices, the film sustains a mood of heightened
consciousness, implying a world of surreal, only half-discernible
connections in which weather, music, landscape, media and the
chance encounters of strangers all suggest an enticing, if slightly
ominous sense of a grand design.
</P>

FORD INTRODUCES DRASTICALLY REDESIGNED TAURUS FOR 2000
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a case of back-to-the-drawing-board for vehicle designers
at Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a drastically redesigned Ford Taurus for 2000, part
of an all-out effort to recapture the momentum this car lost when
it received a radical redesign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall that until the redesign, the Taurus was
America's best-selling car, an honor the vehicle had won several
years in a row. The original Taurus, introduced in the mid-80s, had
a cutting-edge design for the U.S. market, with its flying-wedge

Accented by a strange oval rear window that decreased rearward
visibility and rear-seat head room, the car's popularity dropped.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-SEX-REVIEW (Washington) _ After presidential aspirant
Gary Bauer was criticized for holding private meetings with a
female aide, other politicians and their consultants called the
incident unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals and
at least potentially penalized female aides, particularly in the
wake of the Lewinsky scandal. Bauer and other politicians are
wondering how to preserve their reputations without putting female
aides at a disadvantage in terms of legitimate yet confidential
conferences. By Melinda Henneberger. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ With the Colombian
government facing its most serious crisis in years, the Clinton
administration is scrambling to assemble a package of military and
economic assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the
hemisphere since the Cold War. But administration officials are
struggling to reassure anyone who will listen that Colombia today
looks nothing like El Salvador once did. By Tim Golden. (`i'

</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress is rediscovering the
health care crisis _ which did not go away with the 1994 collapse
of the Clinton administration's effort at a comprehensive overhaul.
What often got lost in the partisan maneuvering and millions of
dollars of lobbying is now unmistakably clear: There was an
objective reality out there. This was not just a political
exercise. President Clinton all but snapped an `I told you so' last
week. `What has happened is exactly what we said would happen,' he
said. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SHOPPING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As electronic commerce
moves into the mainstream, it has prompted a new appreciation for
old-fashioned business skills. Customers, it seems, still have
decidedly offline standards of service. They demand timely delivery
of goods and the ability to easily return merchandise that proves
disappointing, for example. The online retailers who come up short
on those fronts will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin

what they used to, their thrill diluted in an unparalleled flurry
of four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseam on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity. Yet somehow fans still delight in
each individual long ball as it happens. By Alan Schwarz. (also

   DISEASE-WORRIES-REVIEW (New York) _ The region is in the midst
of outbreaks of E. coli bacteria and West Nile flu, and it is the
latter that most people are more concerned about. West Nile is
exotic to this area, and thus provokes fear and a sense that the
ecosystem is out of balance. E. coli is generally perceived to be
the result of human error _ undercooked meat or negligence with the
water supply _ and thus preventable. What is forgotten is that E.
Coli has killed far more people, including children. By Jennifer

   CLINTON-FOREIGN-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's aides
say his chances of achieving a place in history as a master of
foreign policy don't look so bad. Many goals are near fruition. Yet
Clinton was recently forced to retreat on perhaps the longest of
his long-vision goals: ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty.
It is being blocked by Republicans, who may be willing to pass it
only after Clinton leaves office. The incident speaks volumes about
the political atmosphere in which Clinton will have to operate if
he wants to accomplish great things and burnish his legacy in his
final 15 months as president. By Jane Perlez.

   AUSTRIA-NAZIS-REVIEW (Vienna) _ A look at why fears of a revival
of Nazism in Austria are exaggerated. Austria is sometimes
criticized for failing to deal with its Nazi past, while Germany
has constantly apologized. Yet Austria doesn't have gangs attacking
Jewish cemeteries as Germany does. In Austria, non-Nazi

   YUGO-COMMUNISTS-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ In a way, communism still
lives in the former Yugoslavia _ both in patterns of power and

helps explain why efforts to overthrow President Slobodan Milosevic
are faltering. While `reform Communists' are back running Poland,
for example, they are a younger generation, humbled and educated by
periods out of power. But in most former Yugoslav republics, the
same leaders still rule as they did 10 years ago in the name of the
Communist Party. By Steven Erlanger.

A `PEOPLE'S CAR' FOR A NEW CLASS OF PEOPLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM DIEM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Volkswagen won't be keeping many manufacturing secrets when it
begins making a new luxury car late next year. The factory in
downtown Dresden, Germany, will have walls of glass, allowing
customers and passers-by to watch the cars being built.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has VW hidden its ambitions. As along ago as June 1997, the
company's chairman, Ferdinand Piech, talked publicly about his plan
to build a high-end Volkswagen in addition to the Audi line of
luxury cars. Many people thought he was dreaming, but even as he
spoke Mark Lichte was at work on the design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started on this project from the first day on the job two
and a half years ago,'' Lichte said as he hovered over the Concept
D, a show-car version of his baby that was unveiled at the auto
show here last month.
</P>
<P>
   The production version does not yet have a name. Concept D
alludes to the ``D segment'' of the German market, comprising large
cars like the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Unusual for that class, the
Concept D has a fastback shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of VW there are a lot of fastbacks,'' Lichte
said, ``but there are none in the D class. We thought to have an
alternative.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The all-wheel-drive car will have a 5-liter, turbo-diesel V10
engine rated at 313 horsepower. Volkswagen said it might offer
other engines, including a new 12-cylinder gasoline engine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People no longer think Piech is dreaming. Last year, VW bought
control of the Bugatti, Lamborghini and Bentley brands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``VW is probably the only volume manufacturer that could pull
this off cost-effectively,'' said Simon Miller, an automotive
analyst with Credit Lyonnais in London. ``It also has a
quasi-premium brand status that it has built up over the last 10
years or so.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VW executives say the new car will be exported to North America;
the factory can build 40,000 a year. The price is expected to
undercut the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which starts around $70,000.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 10, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-SEX-REVIEW (Washington) _ After presidential aspirant
Gary Bauer was criticized for holding private meetings with a
female aide, other politicians and their consultants called the
incident unsurprising in a world of terrified male principals and
at least potentially penalized female aides, particularly in the
wake of the Lewinsky scandal. Bauer and other politicians are
wondering how to preserve their reputations without putting female
aides at a disadvantage in terms of legitimate yet confidential
conferences. By Melinda Henneberger. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ With the Colombian
government facing its most serious crisis in years, the Clinton
administration is scrambling to assemble a package of military and
economic assistance that could reach dimensions not seen in the
hemisphere since the Cold War. But administration officials are
struggling to reassure anyone who will listen that Colombia today
looks nothing like El Salvador once did. By Tim Golden. (`i'

</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress is rediscovering the
health care crisis _ which did not go away with the 1994 collapse
of the Clinton administration's effort at a comprehensive overhaul.
What often got lost in the partisan maneuvering and millions of
dollars of lobbying is now unmistakably clear: There was an
objective reality out there. This was not just a political
exercise. President Clinton all but snapped an `I told you so' last
week. `What has happened is exactly what we said would happen,' he
said. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-SHOPPING-REVIEW (Undated) _ As electronic commerce
moves into the mainstream, it has prompted a new appreciation for
old-fashioned business skills. Customers, it seems, still have
decidedly offline standards of service. They demand timely delivery
of goods and the ability to easily return merchandise that proves
disappointing, for example. The online retailers who come up short
on those fronts will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin
during this Christmas shopping season. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   HOMERUNS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Home runs have become a dime a
dozen. Like 100-point swings in the stock market, they don't mean
what they used to, their thrill diluted in an unparalleled flurry
of four-baggers. The last decade has seen such an increase in home
runs _ with almost all of them relived ad nauseam on ESPN _ that
the feat has become baseball's slam dunk, a once-sensational event
sabotaged by its own popularity. Yet somehow fans still delight in
each individual long ball as it happens. By Alan Schwarz. (also
moving in `s' category as BBO-HOMERUNS-REVIEW).
</P>
<P>
   DISEASE-WORRIES-REVIEW (New York) _ The region is in the midst
of outbreaks of E. coli bacteria and West Nile flu, and it is the
latter that most people are more concerned about. West Nile is
exotic to this area, and thus provokes fear and a sense that the
ecosystem is out of balance. E. coli is generally perceived to be

Steinhauer.

SWIMMING AGAINST AN EBB TIDE 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass., Md., N.C., Ga.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a lackluster, disappointing third quarter for most mutual
funds, but there were notable exceptions _ many of them helped by
investments in innovative companies in the telecommunications,
semiconductor and biotechnology industries.
</P>
<P>
   And smaller growth stocks in general outpaced bigger,
value-oriented issues in the three months ended Sept. 30, helping
those funds that tilted in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Here, stock-pickers of three top-performing funds for the
quarter look back at what made their funds such standouts _ and
offer a glance ahead. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Disciple of Growth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New technology created the winners in the $145.2 million Strong
Enterprise fund, a mid-cap growth fund. It returned 19.5 percent
for the quarter, taking the No. 1 place among domestic diversified
equity funds. ``We try to identify the leading companies in rapidly
growing industries,'' said its manager, Andrew S. Cupps, 29,
``companies that can capitalize on opportunities in a changing
world.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest winners was Sandisk of Sunnyvale, Calif.,
which makes what is in effect the film used in digital cameras _
the chips on which images are stored. Two million digital cameras
have been sold since their commercial introduction in 1998, said
Cupps, adding that sales of 28 million units are forecast for 2002
_ ``and every one goes out with a Sandisk chip.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, he added, also makes chips that enable portable
music players like the next-generation Sony Walkman _ due in
January _ to play music downloaded from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no market at all for these several months ago,''
Cupps said, ``and now they should sell several million units.''
Sandisk, whose stock rose 44.9 percent in the quarter, also makes
chips that are built into personal digital assistants designed by
Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another winning stock was Broadvision, of Redwood City, Calif.,
a maker of software for companies doing business on the Internet.
Its stock rose 80.4 percent in the quarter. Broadvision software
lets companies like American Airlines offer personalized Web sites,
Cupps said, by helping them identify individual customers and then
offering special deals geared to their spending patterns.
</P>
<P>
   He also made money in Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a
biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass., that specializes in
genomics. Its stock rose 80.6 percent in the quarter. The company's
research on human genes ``can help pharmaceutical companies
discover drugs more quickly and in a more targeted fashion,'' Cupps
said. Millennium is currently focusing on the genetic roots of
obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, he remains optimistic. ``A small group of big
technology stocks and next-generation stocks have been very strong,
but a whole generation of software stocks are down because of Y2K
and other concerns.'' he said, adding that the market could resume
its upward move ``if the economy slows down, and there's some
indication that this is happening.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Monster Bet on Chips &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How did the $265.1 million Northstar Special fund, a small
growth fund, earn its No. 5 place among domestic diversified equity
funds for the quarter? Through investments in semiconductor stocks,
which made up 20 percent of the fund's portfolio, and contributed
mightiliy to its 17.4 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Semiconductor companies are secular growth vehicles that went
through a slowdown last year, partly because of the Asian crisis
and global recession, and began to come out of it this spring,''
said the fund's manager, Mary Lisanti, 43. ``What's helping now is
the strong demand for personal computers because of the Internet,
cheap PC pricing and personal digital assistants.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of her biggest winners was PMC-Sierra, a Burnaby, British
Columbia, manufacturer of semiconductors used in telecommunications
equipment; its stock rose 56.9 percent. The company is highly
profitable and is ``always considered one of the class acts in the
business,'' Ms. Lisanti said, adding that it weathered the recent
downturn better than most of its competitors did. ``It's a
value-added player as opposed to a commodity provider,'' she said,
due to the specialized nature of its chips.
</P>
<P>
   Another hit was Harmonic Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., company that
makes fiber optic systems for delivering voice, data and video over
cable satellites and wireless networks. The company, whose stock
rose 127.7 percent in the quarter, uses a technology called wave
division multiplexing that lets it expand fiber capacity by
splitting light waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to make a 2-lane road into a 10-lane road,'' Ms.
Lisanti said.
</P>
<P>
   She also made money in Applied Micro Circuits, a San Diego
designer and maker of semiconductors used in broadband
communications. ``It has leading-edge chip-manufacturing technology
that it developed for the military, which always sent tons of data
around the world,'' she said. ``Now they're producing it
commercially at a competitive cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose 38.6 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What's ahead for the market? ``This year is the exact opposite
of last year, when you wanted to own the big safe havens,'' Ms.
Lisanti said. ``Now you want the opposite _ more industrially
oriented companies, to benefit from the economic recovery
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   She expects an inflation rate in the 2 percent to 3 percent
range through year-end and long-term interest rates of 6 percent to
7 percent. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thinking Small, Really Small &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to identify the most dynamic companies in the microcap
universe that are also exhibiting above-average relative price
strength,'' said Tom Callan, 39, co-manager with Bill Wykle, 62, of
the $141.9 million Blackrock Microcap Equity Portfolio. In the
third quarter, he found those stocks among emerging biotechnology
and wireless communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The fund returned 17.7 percent in the quarter, earning it the
No. 4 place among domestic diversified equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Among his biggest winners was United Therapeutics, a
biotechnology company in Silver Spring, Md., that produces UT-15, a
new version of a hypertension drug. UT-15 is administered
intravenously, using a tiny portable pump instead of the awkward
refrigeration unit that its predecessor required, Callan said.
``It's a big step up in ease of delivery,'' he added. He originally
bought shares in the June initial public offering. The stock was up
143.2 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He also made money in Trimeris, a Durham, N.C., company that is
developing a new class of AIDS drug, called T-20, that blocks the
HIV virus from entering T-cells, Callan said, adding that it can be
used when combination therapies and protease inhibitors are
ineffective. The stock was up 15.1 percent for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Another winner was Price Communications, a New York company that
provides wireless service, mainly in Georgia and the rural South,
and which benefited from accelerating growth in its number of
subscribers. ``The average revenue per user has remained stable,
even though rates have dropped dramatically across the board,''
added Michael Carey, 30, senior analyst on the fund. The stock rose
75.4 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, ``the market is trying to find a new level of
equilibrium,'' Callan said. He is cautiously upbeat. ``In the
best-case scenario,'' he said, ``third-quarter earnings, which
should be strong, will dominate the news and that should lead a
rally through year-end.''  &QL;

COLUMN: SNEEZE, AMERICA, DON'T BLOW IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, Oct. 11.)  
(js) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ib jor doze id stubbed up, dote blow id.
</P>
<P>
   That's the latest, nasally congested word from U.S. health
experts who say that nose-blowing can actually be bad for you.
</P>
<P>
   According to a team of scientists headed by Dr. Owen Hendley of
the University of Virginia, a vigorous nose-blow can blast infected
mucus up into the sinuses, making matters worse for cold sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   This is terrible news for people like me who blow our nose so
often and so vigorously that it could be considered a form of
aerobic exercise. Some people like to jog, some like to ride bikes
and some like to swim laps. But to me, nothing says cardiovascular
fitness like a roomful of cats and a box of Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   A good, full-bodied blast through the nose produces the same
light-headed rush one gets from running up a flight of stairs,
jumping out of an airplane or winning a free Diet Coke in a
McDonald's scratch-off contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although a nose-blower's high receives scant mention in the
medical journals, it is as real as Y2K, Sasquatch or
campaign-finance reform, take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   If people stop blowing their nose, it could affect the course of
American politics, not to mention the facial-tissue industry. Pat
Buchanan, for example, would be incapable of saying the things he
says if he did not blow his nose hard and loud, non-stop, 24 hours
a day, possibly without taking a breath. Give the man a
decongestant and he starts sounding like Ted Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think Al Gore really believed he invented the Internet?
Heck, no. It was simply a comment born from suddenly _ perhaps too
suddenly _ released nasal congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Virginia scientists said nose-blowers would be
better off coughing or sneezing, which strikes me as an inferior
way of dealing with the problem, not to mention a whole lot more
unsanitary.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that veteran nose-blowers like myself collect
handkerchiefs the way other people might collect shot glasses or
Sno-globes, and that these handkerchiefs sometimes accumulate in
damp wads atop dressers, coffee tables and kitchen counters, that
does not mean that we nose-blowers are unversed in the rudiments of
personal hygiene, nor are we indifferent to the gentle
sensibilities of those who are so fortunate to live with us. You
can, after all, walk around a damp hanky, which is more than you
can say about the germy spume exhaled by sneezers.
</P>
<P>
   (In fairness, it should be noted that nose-blowers do, on
occasion, sneeze and cough, but only in the most delicate and
refined fashion, preferably with a lace hanky covering the nose and
mouth and the left pinky extended.)
</P>
<P>
   Nose-blowing is also a good way to alert your employer that you
may be calling in sick in the not-too-distant future. Bosses tend
to ignore generalized sneezing and coughing, just as they ignore
employees who ask for pay raises and health insurance. But an
employee who can produce a cubicle-rattling blast like a Cape-Fear
foghorn, using nothing but a Kleenex and a few swollen nasal
membranes, is an employee who will be finding himself free for golf
on a lot of Friday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Nose-blowing is, was and always will be an American institution,
no matter what a bunch of preachy Virginia doctors have to say
about it. Nose-blowing fills in those dull, dialogue-heavy minutes
in the movie theaters between the explosions and the car chase.
Nose-blowing occupies your hands when the collection plate is
passed at church. Nose-blowing lifts your energy levels like a Jolt
Cola and a glazed doughnut, but without all the empty calories.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet George Washington was a nose-blower, and that's good

A 49ERS TRADITION: WINNING THROUGH EATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN LYNCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Pizza in the afternoon smells like ...
victory.
</P>
<P>
   And the wafting aroma of catered barbecue lunches elicit the
warm glow of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, football fans, the way to a football team is through its
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it? Just ask the 49ers, who have developed a
culinary reward/punishment system that puts old Pavlov to shame.
When the team wins, players can anticipate a week of Epicurean
delights and positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But after a loss? Well, there haven't been many losses in the
past decade or so. When they do happen, the week is bleak: no food,
no fun, just work.
</P>
<P>
   It's just possible that the San Francisco 49ers manage to stay
successful year after year in part because they've surrounded
themselves with routines and traditions that kick in only after a
win.
</P>
<P>
   This year, those conventions may have helped steady the 49ers'
ship after a horrendous start. The 49ers were thumped in their
opener, 41-3 by Jacksonville, which seemed to confirm the preseason
predictions of the dynasty's demise.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team rattled off three straight wins, yet again
affirming the 49er legend. While other teams flounder after serious
injuries, San Francisco keeps going. The 49ers started the season
with their 1,570-yard rusher from last season, Garrison Hearst, on
the bench. Then they played without quarterback Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams, like Atlanta and Denver, are a combined 0-8 without
their established offensive threats. The 49ers are 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   How do they do it? Some might say it's because of winning
tradition, veteran leadership and consistently unbeatable game
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason?
</P>
<P>
   Food.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza is trucked in Monday following wins. Players mill around
the large square boxes in their lounge just off the locker room.
Eyes get big and stomachs are filled as players pop open the boxes
and indulge in their victory pie.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also have a midweek tradition of catered barbecue
suppers after Thursday practice. The silver trays of slathered ribs
and chicken are displayed on red-clothed tables. The meals are
replete with rolls, corn bread, cole slaw, salad and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest payoff occurs Saturday night when the team gathers
at a hotel, whether home or away. Cartons of ice cream are broken
out along with chicken, hamburgers and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches then award T-shirts for special teams' exploits. The
``hammer'' shirt goes to the special teams' player who recorded a
big hit. The ``Gut Buster'' shirt is for the special teams' player
who exhibited exceptional hustle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for team chemistry,'' said cornerback
Darnell Walker. ``It helps us jell.'' The club then settles in for
a video presentation pieced together by head coach Steve Mariucci
and the organization's video crew of Keith and Robbie Yanagi.
</P>
<P>
   Video of the previous week's network broadcast are spliced with
clips from movies for humorous effect. Terrell Owens pounded his
chest after snaring a touchdown pass in the 49ers first win of the
season, a 28-21 defeat of New Orleans. His move was captured on
video and then quickly followed by an old clip of Tarzan beating
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers were playing the Cardinals that week, so the video
ended with scenes from the remake of the Alfred Hitchcock movie
``The Birds.'' It showed birds exploding in mid-air.
</P>
<P>
   The food rewards might seem a bit obvious, but hey, it works.
It's all part of the culture of winning exuded by the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are always sore and grumpy,'' said Mariucci, who
instituted the video gimmick. ``There's expectations and there's
ups and downs. Somewhere along the line you got to enjoy the
journey ... When we show that film, they are just bouncing off the
walls. It's good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers win enough that the victory traditions are routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can cause some domestic disputes,'' joked guard Ray Brown.
He said his wife rarely fixes dinner on Thursday because she knows
her husband has his barbecue at the team facility.
</P>
<P>
   During a losing week, Brown has arrived home to an empty house
and no dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday spread cuts both ways _ reward and pain. That's
because one player or a group of players has to pick up the $3,000
tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's expensive,'' said Brown, who picked up the bill for a
supper last year. ``And if no one volunteers, then coach (Mariucci)
will pick someone. But, hey, you got to do it.''

<P>
   A volatile stock market was particularly punishing to big growth
stocks and value issues in the third quarter, while many small
stocks and overseas investments fared better. That gave an edge to
investors with diversified portfolios, including the five money
managers who have assembled hypothetical retirement portfolios for
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Though all five portfolios lost ground over the three months,
each beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, a benchmark that
has largely been unbeatable in the last few years but that lost
6.25 percent in the quarter. By contrast, the average diversified
domestic equity fund tracked by Lipper Inc. lost 5.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The winning manager for the quarter was Jack A. Brill, a San
Diego investment adviser who has built a ``socially responsible''
portfolio. Over all, he lost 2.13 percent. His two stakes that held
up best were MMA Praxis International, which rose 5.48 percent, and
IPS Millennium, a growth-and-income fund, up 5.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe it is more important than ever for long-term
investors to be well-diversified in stock size and across mutual
fund style,'' Brill said. And he does not expect the market to
stabilize anytime soon. ``As we get closer to year-end and
potential Y2K problems,'' he said, referring to widespread concerns
that some computers will malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, ``we may very
well see a continuation of third-quarter action into the fourth
quarter, with continuing high volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   For more diversification, he is trimming his position in Ariel
Appreciation, which owns small- and mid-cap value stocks, to 10
percent from 15 percent, and using the proceeds to increase his
stakes in two index funds, Domini Social Equity and Citizens Index,
to 15 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the managers' hypothetical portfolios is
tracked each quarter by Lipper, of Summit, N.J. Figures exclude
sales charges, transaction costs and taxes because most retirement
money is held in tax-deferred accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The five managers may choose any funds open to new investors and
may shift money quarterly. From the outset of the competition, in
July 1993, they were asked to pick portfolios intended to grow for
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Jacobs, who edits the No-Load Fund Investor in
Irvington, N.Y., retains the overall lead among the five managers,
with a gain of 144.6 percent since the contest began.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the five portfolios have risen an average of
123.92 percent, compared with a 228.74 percent return for the
Vanguard 500 Index fund, which mimics the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Susan Dziubinski, who edits the Morningstar
Fund Investor, placed second, with a loss of 2.31 percent. She was
helped largely by international holdings _ Founders Passport, which
rose 6.92 percent, and EuroPacific Growth, up 5.74 percent. ``Just
a year ago, people were asking why they should bother with
international investing,'' she said. ``Here's why: International
investing is alive and kicking, thanks to the long-beleaguered but
now-reviving Japan and rebounding emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dziubinski also held the fund that performed best in the
quarter among those held by the five managers: Oppenheimer Real
Asset, which owns commodity-linked investments and which gained
16.69 percent. ``It won't give consistent overperformance _ more
fits and starts,'' she said. ``But as a portfolio hedge, it seems
to be working fine for me. Over the long term, it should help to
smooth out the bumps in the portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   She is selling her stake in Founders Passport, she said, because
the fund's manager, Michael W. Gerding, left in July. She is using
the proceeds to increase her holdings in a core position, TIAA-CREF
Growth and Income, to 30 percent from 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Kobren, president of Kobren Insight Group and editor of
Fidelity Insight in Wellesley, Mass., came in third for the
quarter. His all-Fidelity portfolio lost 3.47 percent. As did Ms.
Dziubinski, Kobren benefited from investment overseas: One of his
funds, Fidelity International Value, gained 6.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His big loser was Fidelity Value, down 11.18 percent. But he
plans to stay with the fund. ``The setback could be attributed to
cyclicals moving too far, too fast, in April and May,'' he said.
``At this point, we believe the value correction has run its
course, and Fidelity Value remains very well poised to profit from
the continuing strong economy and potential rising commodity
prices.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is reducing his position in Fidelity Contrafund II to 15
percent, from 25 percent, and using the proceeds to start a 10
percent position in Fidelity Aggressive Growth. The manager of that
fund, Erin Sullivan, ``has proven to be very adept at maneuvering
in the volatile high-tech and health care arenas,'' he said. ``But
we've been even more impressed by the controlled losses this fund
has sustained during the inevitable dips.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold R. Evensky, an investment adviser in Coral Gables, Fla.,
took fourth place for the quarter, with a loss of 4.87 percent. He
was hurt by his stakes in Matthews Pacific Tiger, an
emerging-markets fund, down 13.49 percent, and Vanguard Value
Index, a growth-and-income fund, down 9.24 percent. But he plans no
changes in his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My managers in the international developed, small-cap growth
and value sectors continue to outperform the S&AMP;P 500,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the recent high-flying
emerging markets. Still, the game plan is to manage risk as well as
return.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs finished last in the quarter, with a loss of 5.17
percent. He is dropping two laggards, Vanguard Windsor II and Baron
Growth (each 10 percent of his portfolio), and starting a 15
percent position in Janus Olympus and a 5 percent position in T.
Rowe Price Science and Technology. The changes shift his exposure
toward large cap-growth and technology stocks and away from smaller
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although certain small-cap funds have done quite well
recently, small-cap indexes such as the Russell have performed only
as well as the S&AMP;P 500 in the third quarter,'' Jacobs said. ``And
if we do get a major correction or bear market, the small caps will
decline more than the large caps.''

 &HT;    Bulldogs look to end 'The Streak'
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Georgia has done its best to play down its
current losing streak to Tennessee. But the Bulldogs' eight
consecutive losses to the Vols have been brought up to them
continuously _ and not just this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm aware of (the losing streak),'' Georgia quarterback
Quincy Carter said glumly. ``Our fans remind us of it every
offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-ranked Bulldogs (4-0, 2-0 SEC) will do their best to
reverse their fortunes tonight when they meet No. 6 Tennessee (3-1,
1-1) in a nationally televised game played before 107,000 at
Neyland Stadium. Even though Georgia is undefeated and in first
place in the SEC's Eastern Division, Tennessee is favored by 11
points.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulldogs lose tonight, it will be their longest losing
streak against any team in their 107-year history. Despite such
external pressures, Georgia seems a relatively loose bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be scared against Tennessee; the flight's already
booked,'' junior Jonas Jennings cracked.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time Georgia has taken a 4-0 team against
the Vols. The Bulldogs have been 4-0 each of the last two times
they faced Tennessee. The Vols won each of those contests handily,
38-13 in Knoxville in '97 and 22-3 last year in Athens
</P>
<P>
   But after consecutive one-point wins over Central Florida and
LSU, the Bulldogs come here with a considerable amount of humility.
And Georgia coach Jim Donnan sees the attitude as a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bulldogs were undefeated and sky high coming off
a 28-27 upset of sixth-ranked LSU in Baton Rouge. Meanwhile,
Tennessee had lost starting tailback Jamal Lewis to a season-ending
knee injury the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we spent a little too much time letting people
congratulate us, rather than thinking about what we had to do to
win the game,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the defending national champions had their 14-game
winning streak ended by Florida 23-21 on Sept. 18 in Gainesville,
and they needed a long pass play in the final minute to defeat
Memphis 17-16 a week later. However, Tennessee appeared to get its
offense untracked in a 24-0 win over Auburn last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been perfect and they haven't been perfect,''
Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``I don't know of anybody who
has. Georgia's been good enough to be 4-0, and that's good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The game has several subplots. Three of the Vols' star players _
Cosey Coleman, Deon Grant and Jamal Lewis _ are Georgians. Two
coaches, Rodney Garner and Kevin Ramsey, defected from the
Volunteers to join Georgia's staff the last two years. An academic
fraud controversy hovers over Tennessee, a story broken by ESPN,
which is televising the game.
</P>
<P>
   And the two head coaches have been cool to each other since
Donnan accused Fulmer of running up the score two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the main story line is the one that involves the
Southeastern Conference Championship. With Florida and Tennessee
already having lost in the conference, a Bulldog victory would push
them a long way toward their first SEC title since 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to be in the SEC championship picture, this is a
critical game for us,'' Garner said. ``It's going to be no place
for the mild or the meek. It's going to be a war.''

   Karl Lagerfeld a innovator for Chanel, not a follower
</P>
<P>
   By A. Scott Walton
</P>
<P>
   FASHION EDITOR
</P>
<P>
   Paris _ Fashion Week began winding down to a close here on
Friday, with two of this city's most formidable designers
punctuating the most popular trends for spring/summer 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In each of their shows, Chanel's Karl Lagerfeld and Christian
Lacroix sent out clothes in a rich range of colors and wide
assortment of shapely silhouettes. But that's where the
similarities between their collections end.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld's themes were stylish, sexy, and, by this city's
standards, sensible. Lacroix's looks, on the other hand, were
indecipherably complex.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's far passed the point of having to prove his creative
prowess, Lagerfeld still strives to make strong statements. Friday,
the German-born genius flaunted the financial might that allowed
him to employ nearly 100 models and staged a fast-paced preview
that featured a medley of R&AMP;B music. The chorus of the soundtrack
was the James Brown lyric Lagerfeld could justifiably sing himself:
``I've got soul, and I'm super bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Some designers are hired to maintain the status quo for a design
house; but Lagerfeld, always an innovator, this year shredded the
Chanel suit's mystique. The items in this collection invoked the
spirit of things being separate, but equal.
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld left no doubt that quilted stretch synthetics can
carry as much weight in a woman's wardrobe as quirky snakeskins;
that knee-length skirts matter as much as ankle-grazing pants; that
floral prints are as important as solids; and that accessories are
as key to being well-dressed as coats.
</P>
<P>
   The floral prints _ rendered in chiffon, and often accented with
the brand's interlocking ''C'' logo _ looked more abstract than
natural. The snakeskins looked slathered in semi-precious stones.
The skirts were fluted or gathered into pouches at the hem. The
jeans, with three zippers down the front , molded to models' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Colors ranged from black and white to peach, pink and perky
blues. Handbags were compact and quilted, Lagerfeld said, to look
like ''chocolate bars.''
</P>
<P>
   No Chanel show would be complete without a least a few felted
wool pieces, this time in the form of angular torso wraps held up
under the bosom with shoestring-thin belts.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix losing it?
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Chanel show, Lacroix's preview made it appear
the designer was holding onto his sanity by a thread, a fancy one
at that: maniacal pattern mixes and florals looking like
fruit-colored amoebas under the lens of a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Only the florals in black-and-white woven silk and the
hand-painted palm patterns were easily discernible.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it seems Lacroix has staged his show in an effort to
shock, rather than sell. And this was no more evident than in
ensembles typified by diagonally striped black pants paired with
something like a polka-dotted top _ with an arrow poking out a
model's hair as an added flourish. Undoubtedly, there were
precious, masterfully-made items in the collection. But it's never
easy to appreciate what's special about Lacroix's designs when he
conceals them with such distracting color combinations.
</P>
<P>
   On other runways
</P>
<P>
   Film screens showed clips from Kenzo's life and old friends
paraded as mannequins during the ``This Is Your Life''-style bash _
including motorcycles, a white horse and a whirling dervish onstage
_ celebrating his last collections before retirement. Kenzo, 61,
the first Japanese couturier to conquer Paris is stepping down from
the company he founded 30 years ago and is looking forward to
travel and artistic projects after his successor Gilles Rosier
takes over.
</P>
<P>
   The women's clothes for the coming season featured blousy belted
suits, skirts to the knee and short tunic dresses _ all showing
plenty of color along with some interesting crinkled fabrics in
neutrals and grays.
</P>
<P>
   The beige dress with a pleated skirt and the full,
pastel-striped skirt were wonderful, as were the trouser suits in
yellow, lavender or pink and the bright print shorts out of a
Caribbean fantasy. Men walked along with the women in squarish
linen suits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Kenzo, known for his cheerful clothes, went back to his
roots with beautiful kimono ideas, huge obi-style bows at the waist
or shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The audience boasted plenty of designer stars, Sonia Rykiel and
Alber Elbaz of Yves Saint Laurent among them. ``It was colorful,
dazzling, marvelous,'' Elbaz said afterward. ``And sort of like
seeing the end of an era, the last of a kind of very independent
designers.''

 &HT;    It all started with the blues
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, OCTOBER 10. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a reason they call it the blues.
</P>
<P>
   Blues, plural. Blues, as in there's a lot of them. Blues, not a
specific color or tone but a spectrum. A continuum. An American
continuum that was born with the century, evolved over its course
and will usher it out. Blues scattered across a far-reaching arc
that has its origins in field hollers, sanctified shouts and the
coded polyrhythms of West Africa. Blues that connect the dots
between ragtime and hip-hop, and form the spine of rock,
rockabilly, gospel, rhythm and blues, jazz, bluegrass and country
music.
</P>
<P>
   Blues that come raw and electrified, like the music Muddy Waters
recorded for Chess Records in his 1950s Chicago heyday _ with his
mojo woikin' _ and blues that are gleaming and opulent, like the
music Duke Ellington composed for his great orchestras. Blues that
rip through the fabric of time like they were a cheap bedsheet and
leave the listener spellbound by their power, which is why Robert
Johnson continues to haunt us. Blues appropriated, quoted, latched
onto as a mask that allows performers to reveal more than they ever
could in a bare-faced confession, which is what gives 1990s rock
singer Polly Jean Harvey her bewitching focus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how many variations it seeds or seasons, no matter
how complex or abstract or tucked away or thrust forward its
influence, the blues are always elemental _ a natural fact. It's
the most vital strand in the DNA of American popular music.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Johnny Shines says, the blues are the pillars of the
piers,'' says Peter Guralnick, author of the two-volume biography
of Elvis Presley, ``Last Train to Memphis'' and ``Careless Love.''
Taking a cue from the country bluesman, Guralnick emphasizes the
way the blues gave license to musicians, black and white, who heard
it. ``As much as musically, it offered an emotional spontaneity, a
structure in which people could express emotion straight out.''
</P>
<P>
   You may think the following example preposterous, but to get a
handle on what this means, think of the blues as the single degree
of separation between the most unlikely pieces of music. Imagine
this: The blues are what link the metropolitan grandeur of George
Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' (1924) to the primordial
sludge-rock of Black Sabbath's 1970s heavy-metal anthem ``Iron
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gershwin, who was influenced by the pre-blues ``coon'' songs of
the 1890s, looked to vernacular forms as a way to color the tunes
he composed on Tin Pan Alley. He borrowed from African-American
musicians, and then they borrowed back. Bebop, the mathematically
complex form of jazz that emerged right after World War II, took
the kind of show tunes Gershwin wrote and briskly improvised on
their chord changes. Later, Gershwin's 1935 folk opera ``Porgy and
Bess,'' was recast by Miles Davis and his arranger Gil Evans in
1958 as a cool orchestral showcase for the jazz legend's sublimely
melancholy trumpet. It's the kind of cultural exchange that America
was built on.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne can't claim the
same artistic pedigree, but like Gershwin, his particular genius as
an entertainer couldn't have existed without the blues to back him
up. His band's brutally rudimentary rock songs developed out of the
same British blues-rock sources as the Yardbirds and Cream. Except,
where Gershwin looked to the blues as the source of a populist art
music, Osbourne heard distortion and an id-driven frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the blooze, and look ahead a decade to a teenage Kurt
Cobain entranced by its thunderous beats and glacial tempos. The
furious melodies of Nirvana _ and the mainstreaming of alternative
rock _ were just around the bend.
</P>
<P>
   The connections to the blues aren't always obvious. Sometimes
they wiggle and blur. Not long before he committed suicide, Cobain
made it explicit, paying homage to the 1930s troubadour Leadbelly
on ``MTV Unplugged'' with a version of ``Where Did You Sleep Last
Night?'' Also known as ``In the Pines,'' it's actually an old
Appalachian murder ballad _ exactly the kind of material that the
blues existed to transform.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to soar
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from the black church, popularized by
rhythm-and-blues visionary George Clinton on Funkadelic's 1978
album, ``One Nation Under a Groove,'' the influence of the blues is
``so high you can't get over it, so low you can't get under it, so
wide you can't get around it.''
</P>
<P>
   George Clinton isn't strictly a blues musician. He's a former
doo-wop guy from Detroit who fused elements of acid rock, James
Brown's propulsive funk grooves and his own outrageous cosmic
fantasies into a subversive hybrid of sci-fi and hard-core R&AMP;B. If
a 12-year-old has heard Clinton these days, it's probably because,
after James Brown (or Brown's celebrated ``funky drummer'' Clyde
Stubblefield), Clinton's music is sampled ubi-
</P>
<P>
   quitously by hip-hop record producers. But Clinton is part of
the cultural line, and he knows exactly what novelist and critic
Albert Murray was talking about when he wrote the following words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blues as such are synonymous with low spirits. Blues music
is not,'' Murray says in his 1976 study, ``Stomping the Blues,''
his vibrant introduction to music, and the ways that jazz developed
from it. When Murray describes ``the most miserable moaning and
groaning, the most excruciating screaming and howling'' as the
focal point of, say, a boisterous Saturday night at a juke joint or
dance hall, he might be echoing generations of naysayers who have
dismissed the blues and its progeny _ all those wailing saxophones,
all those loud guitars _ as so much noise. But he's actually saying
that the extreme passion of the music liberates those who embrace
it. Murray defined swing, the insistent rhythmic element that
underpins most traditional jazz, as ``the velocity of
celebration.'' It's one of the grooves, as Funkadelic shouts, that
has taught a nation how to dance its way out of its constrictions _
even if only for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnomusicologist Robert Farris Thompson has called that
alchemical property ``the flash of the spirit,'' and it speaks
through improvisation. Hear the way B.B. King bends his guitar
string to emphasize feeling, or how generations of slide guitarists
_ from seminal force Blind Willie Johnson to latter-day acolyte
Stevie Ray Vaughan _ have used the sawed-off neck of a bottle to
conjure otherworldly effects. Hear how rock demigod Jimi Hendrix
ignited the painfully amusical ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' into a
breathtaking meteor shower, or how saxophonist John Coltrane remade
the treacly ``My Favorite Things'' into an epic mantra. Blues has
the power to crack the shell of the ordinary so that it becomes
surreal. Listen to Billie Holiday sing even the blandest show tune,
and she turns it into a seance with the subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   It can be incantatory, this power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raunchy, revolutionary, out there,'' says Dianne McIntyre, a
New York-based choreographer who has based much of her work on
collaborations with blues and jazz artists, such as Olu Dara and
Ornette Coleman. ``It makes you feel you can soar.'' It's what the
bravest pop and rock singers do, even when they're not as vocally
gifted as the melismatic Whitney Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In their classic albums of the 1970s, punk-rock poet Patti Smith
and Irish soul man Van Morrison visit the slipstream of the blues
continuum. They speak in tongues to say what can't be said in plain
speech, conversing with demons and angels. Smith's ecstatic reading
of ``Gloria'' (a song of testifying desire that Morrison wrote with
Irish rock group Them) or the entirety of Morrison's beatific
``Astral Weeks'' radiate with blues feeling _ the notion that sense
can yield to sound and convey a profound truth. Even when, as
Murray told us, that sound constitutes ``the most miserable moaning
and groaning, the most excruciating screaming and howling.''
</P>
<P>
   A commanding sound
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson, the most legendary of all blues singers, heard
that noise, too. He sang of having a ``Hellhound on My Trail.''
Johnson, of course, provided the blues _ and American popular
culture _ with its own Faust saga. Popular blues lore has it that
he sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads in exchange for
uncanny mastery over his guitar. A few years later, according to
myth, he died mysteriously in a juke joint, down on all fours
barking like a dog, poisoned by a jealous lover. The story has
produced a body of work that is vast compared to the hour's worth
of songs Johnson recorded in 1936 _ songs that have continuously
cycled through American pop life, as successive generations pillage
or prize a ``Hellhound on My Trail,'' or a ``Cross Roads Blues'' or
a ``Love in Vain,'' looking for secrets between the lines of those
satanic verses.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's legacy has inspired genius and hokum. You can hear him
conjured in the best music the Rolling Stones ever made (the
shambling dread of ``Exile on Main Street'') and in a stunning
track by the Houston gangsta rap group Geto Boys called ``Mind
Playing Tricks on Me.'' He's what the Red Hot Chili Peppers and
Cassandra Wilson have in common. While a devotee and fellow Delta
native nicknamed Muddy Waters would make the transition from
country blues in the 1930s to forge the dynamic Chicago blues sound
of the 1950s and stage a comeback in the 1970s, Johnson became a
kind of phantom. But a phantom who could materialize everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Robert Johnson's first album came out in 1961, it may not
have sold a lot of copies, but it made a huge impact on people like
Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones,''
Guralnick says, citing the direct influence Johnson commanded over
1960s rock. ``The myth appealed to people but it wasn't myth that
sustained his influence. It's the way his songs enter the language.
You hear it everyday whether you know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson inspired dumb movies, such as Walter Hill's
``Crossroads,'' in which ``Karate Kid'' Ralph Macchio takes on the
powers of darkness, represented by a poofy-haired heavy-metal
guitarist, in a musical duel.
</P>
<P>
   And he eventually ended up on a postage stamp, based on a rare
photo-booth snapshot. The cigarette that had dangled from his lips
had been thoughtfully airbrushed away _ not unlike the trebly vinyl
scratches that were cleaned up when Columbia released its two-CD
Johnson
</P>
<P>
   box set in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Music and society
</P>
<P>
   And yet, that feeling Johnson tapped into can never be erased.
It's always floating around, waiting to be evoked. As the audience
for traditional blues has long been predominantly white, the music
often can't escape from its own museum: a place of false nostalgia,
good times and overpriced beer. Think of ``The Blues Brothers''
movie or the heavily merchandised hoo-haw of the House of Blues
chain. John Lennon once called the blues ``the first chair,'' but
its survival as a commercial genre has often relied on its becoming
just another theme park.
</P>
<P>
   That is, in itself, nothing new. ``The commercialization of
black culture has allowed it to be much more permeable than the
people themselves,'' says Dwight Andrews, professor of music at
Emory University and a composer who has frequently collaborated
with playwright August Wilson. Wilson draws deeply on blues culture
in his work (``Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,'' ``Seven Guitars'').
``When white audiences were flocking to hear Duke Ellington play
his `jungle music' in the 1920s, they went because it was the hot
new product, not necessarily because they wanted the band to come
home for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   As Andrews views it, the blues is as contemporary as it is
historic. It's an almost generic influence on 20th-century American
music because it condenses the basics of Western harmonic practice.
We're so used to it, it's second nature. But Andrews also suggests
that the blues abide, even if you don't recognize them as such,
because the social conditions that fostered them 100 years ago
still exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason hip-hop is an extension of the blues is that many
of its aspects are shaped by racism and oppression _ there are
still reasons to sing the blues,'' Andrews says. Rap music _ ``the
CNN of black America,'' declared the pace-setting rapper Chuck D of
Public Enemy _ has become, in many respects, what blues once was:
black popular music whose narratives express and protest aspects of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even as we look at hip-hop today, the ultimate expressions
of hip-hop are not what we hear on the radio,'' Andrews continues.
``It's all driven by commerce, just as it was when (pioneering
women blues singers) Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were performing 80
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, to hear where the blues has traveled, you have to
look where it's not advertised. You would have to have seen PJ
Harvey on the first part of her 1995 tour, when the British singer
was promoting her new album, ``To Bring You My Love.'' The music
Harvey and her band played wasn't really blues, but its eerie,
discordant pulse and voodoo-queen gestures were unimaginable
without the blues. The blues, which Harvey heard as a child,
listening to the Howling Wolf albums in her parents' record
collection, told her how to do what she did. And that was reach
back to that mythic, moonlit Delta crossroads and grab a fistful of
Robert Johnson's bedeviled dust.
</P>
<P>
   There's a line to a 1970s Rolling Stones song that goes, ``Your
old-time religion is just soul possession.'' Harvey embodied that
in a way that is terrifying and thrilling, self-consciously
theatrical and uncannily real. Time was running out on the
century's clock, but Harvey had something stronger than time.
Something so low, so high, so wide that there was no point in
contesting it. And even if you could, you wouldn't want to.

   The festive rattle of seeds against gourd, the clap of stick
hitting stick, the deep vibration of fingers against drum _ these
rhythms transform a Sunday afternoon in a Piedmont-Lindbergh
apartment clubhouse into an African worship experience.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, voices chanting _ sometimes soft and slow,
sometimes high-pitched and fast _ break through. Neighboring
children, used to the weekday sounds of the clubhouse's day care
center, often stop to watch, their faces pressed against the glass
wall.
</P>
<P>
   This is the weekly religious service of the Ile Ori Ifa Temple.
Several dozen African-American adults and about 10 children come to
sing and dance and hear lessons in Ifa (EE-fay) _ a religion built
around a reverence for ancestors and spiritual beings known as
orisa.
</P>
<P>
   Many were raised in various denominations of the Christian
faith, but consider Ifa, which originated with the Yoruba peoples
of West Africa more than a millennium ago, the faith of their
forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   A basketball net on a pole has been pushed aside. Against one
wall, plants and candles sit on a low altar over a grass mat. A
half-circle of orange stacking chairs marks the sacred space,
inside which women in bright flowing dresses and head wraps and men
in loose African-inspired suits move their bare feet on the dingy
tile floor to the rhythm of African instruments. The slapping of
their feet blends into the percussion, and the dance seems almost
involuntary.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny boy sways gently as he stares wide-eyed at his family. A
baby girl in bright yellow rocks sleepily to the rhythm in her
mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Temple founder Oguntolu Akinlana, 45 _ who carries the title
babalawo, or high priest _ notes that Ifa has become more accepted
in the United States, taking its place alongside Santeria and
Vodun, or voodoo, which blend elements of Catholicism with
traditional African religious practice. He believes Ifa _ which
continues without obvious Catholic influence_is closer to the form
of faith the ancestors practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Raised Roman Catholic in Baltimore, Akinlana vowed to become
familiar with African culture and spirituality after missions to
Johannesburg in the 1970s with the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to meet African priests and get readings from
them,'' he said. ``Part of my destiny was that I was to be a
messenger for the ancestors and to make available the information
to African-Americans who are unsatisfied in their religious life.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the Air Force in 1983, became a jeweler in Florida, and
continued to study African traditions. In 1992, he traveled to
Nigeria, where he was initiated as an Ifa priest. He moved to
Atlanta in 1994 and founded the temple here.
</P>
<P>
   Ifa is ``a beautiful religion,'' said J. Lorand Matory,
professor of anthropology and Afro-American studies at Harvard
University. ``More and more, people of color seek solace in a
religion that shows their own image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of people who migrate look for ties to the
place from whence they came, to their roots,'' said Sandra Barnes,
professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. Barnes
became interested in orisa worship while living in Nigeria. ``I saw
various ritual and religious practices, and I thought I should know
about them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ifa teaches that to be fulfilled, people must integrate the
practical with the spiritual, says Philip John Neimark, a convert
who wrote ``The Way of the Orisa'' (HarperSanFrancisco, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   According to Neimark, there are three main facets of Ifa:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ancestor worship, which taps into the ``energy and wisdom''
of deceased blood relatives. Ifa practitioners have ancestor altars
in their homes, with photographs, candles and flowers, and offer
prayers daily to deceased kin.
</P>
<P>
   -- Orisa worship. Ifa is essentially monotheistic but recognizes
orisa, or different aspects of the one god. In Ifa, Osun represents
money, love and conception; Sango controls thunder and lightning;
and the warrior Ogun is over all metals, for example. Each person
also has an ori, or individual orisa, that serves as a guardian
angel.
</P>
<P>
   -- Divination, through which followers of Ifa can learn their
futures. Most everyday divination is done with an opele, a chain of
shells that, in how it falls, leads the divining priest to a
particular odu, or sacred story, with a message for the
practitioner. Once handed down orally, these teachings are now in a
sacred text made up of 16 major books and 240 minor ones, each with
hundreds of verses. When larger issues are involved, the babalawo
uses ikin, or special palm nuts, to ascertain the right odu.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in I Ching or astrology, Ifa divination of an event does
not mean it is inevitable. An Ifa reading foretells what will
happen if nothing is changed, according to Neimark.
</P>
<P>
   One way to change the future is to call upon the ancestors and
orisa for intercession. Gaining their assistance can involve
preparing offerings of money, plants and other kinds of gifts. When
major issues are involved or when someone is being initiated into
the faith, this may involve blood sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Specific animals are used for specific problems or desires,
according to Neimark. To get a wife, a man should sacrifice a hen
or female goat; a woman should sacrifice a rooster or male goat to
get a husband. Pigs, guinea fowl and fish encourage prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Local adherents buy animals from outlying farms and have outdoor
ceremonies of sacrifice on appropriate occasions, leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   In modern America, the practice may be controversial, but
Akinlana maintains it is simply a recognition of the transfer of
energy in the cycle of life. It is similar to Jewish and Muslim
dietary laws governing the preparation of meat, he said, since
animals ritually killed are treated with dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go to Kentucky Fried Chicken every day. They don't ask
how these chickens are killed or whether somebody prayed over
them,'' Akinlana said. ``Chickens are not born in (supermarkets).''
</P>
<P>
   When the ritual is over, the sacrifice is shared and becomes
dinner. ``It's a spiritual barbecue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For some African-Americans whose families came to the United
States as slaves, the practice of Ifa represents a kind of
reclamation of their roots.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became auainted with Ifa, Robert Jones had an ancestor
altar of sorts. He had photographs of deceased family members on a
table with flowers and a candle.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, he was Father Robert, a Catholic priest in the
Capuchin order, ordained by Atlanta's late Archbishop James Lyke in
1991. Today, he is Ifadero Ifadoyin _ a name that means ``Ifa is as
sweet as honey,'' and Aug. 1 he was ordained a priest in Ifa.
</P>
<P>
   Ifadoyin, 43, was raised in a nonreligious home and converted to
Catholicism in his 20s, attracted by the social work of the
Catholic Church and the sacrifices of modern-day martyrs. He was
serving St. Anthony's church in Atlanta's West End when he attended
a lecture on ``Orisa Consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the lecturer made a lot of sense _ especially
when she talked about the significance of ancestors. ``It makes you
realize that what you got from those who went before you is more
than DNA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When his religious order asked him to move to the Bronx, he left
the priesthood and began working in various retail jobs. He
remained Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Through word-of-mouth and the Internet, he continued to explore
Ifa.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he heard of the opening of the Ile Ori Ifa Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the singing and dancing and just the whole spirit kind of
pulled me in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ifa priests do not proselytize, and the faith teaches that there
are many roads to God, he said. But many American converts from
other faiths, like himself, consider Ifa to be the best route for
their own journey.
</P>
<P>
   Osunleye Ayobunmi Asake, 33, who was raised a Holiness
Christian, was visiting her hometown of Savannah two years ago when
she ran across a book about Ifa. She was so impressed, she skipped
the family's Thanksgiving dinner to drive home to Atlanta to build
an ancestors' shrine.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, she and her husband visited Nigeria to be initiated
into the priesthood at the Idin Ileke Temple in Osogbo, the mother
temple of the Atlanta congregation.
</P>
<P>
   When she tried to talk about what her new faith means to her,
she broke into sobs. ``It's like I've found myself with my
spiritual family,'' she said. ``It's like all my life I was lost
and I've finally found a home.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ile Ori Ifa Temple will hold its 2nd Annual Ifa Festival on
Sunday, beginning at noon at Camp Truitt-Fulton campground, 4300
Herschel Road, College Park, Ga. For information, call 404-691-6509
or 404-830-7996.

 &HT;    Georgia Tech putting up impressive numbers
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thanks to Georgia Tech's rise into the Top Ten, mere
victories might not be enough for the No. 7-ranked Yellow Jackets.
Suddenly, they have national-championship and major-bowl dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And as the season moves on, winning big becomes important, in
non-playoff, major college football.
</P>
<P>
   When Tech (3-1, 1-1 ACC) entertains North Carolina (1-1, 0-3)
for homecoming today, most attention will be focused on the
offensive numbers. The Jackets' 45.3 points a game lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And the more Tech scores, the more attention will be directed
toward quarterback Joe Hamilton, the NCAA leader in pass efficiency
whose race for the Heisman shortens with each nationally televised
highlight.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, however, eagerly would trade Heisman hardware for a
national-title trophy.``That is what you come to college for,'' he
said before the season.
</P>
<P>
   So, for some viewers, those who vote in the Top 25 polls and
crunch numbers for computer rankings, how many points the Jackets
surrender will be as important as how many they score.
</P>
<P>
   That combination helps formulate the convoluted Bowl
Championship Series rankings that will determine who will get to
play for the national championship. Or at least, who gets to go
bowling for the big New Year's Day dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, margin of victory is part of the BCS equation,
and Tech's young defense, which has shined at times but is still
allowing 24 points a game, will be called upon to carry its end of
the load.
</P>
<P>
   Challenge accepted. ``You want to be at a place like this,''
defensive coordinator Ted Roof said, ``where people really care how
you perform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackets have improved. The defense could not make enough
stops to give the offense more chances to beat Florida State. But
it did firm up enough to avoid being upset by Maryland, forcing the
Terrapins to go three-and-out on 10 of 17 possessions.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, though, the Jackets defense _ an enthusiastic
bunch with a penchant for over-reacting -- faces a hungry team with
a quarterback, Ronald Curry, who is as explosive but erratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to continue to be aggressive,'' coach George
O'Leary said. ``That's the only way to play defense. But they have
to remember (that), when something bad happens, the next play is
the most important ''

THE POOL REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 10, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   White House reporters and war reporters before them long ago
evolved the custom of the pool report. When something interesting
is happening, yet there is not enough room for all to go along, one
or several representatives of the press corps are chosen to witness
the event close up, then write accounts from which all the others
are free to draw for their own reports.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these pool reports have become underground classics over
the years. Written as they are for a small audience of news
professionals, they often demonstrate a sharp eye for precisely the
sorts of illuminating details and judgments that cannot be printed
in a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the sort has occured with Edmund Morris, whose book
``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan'' has been getting clobbered on
nearly every hand by reviewers who have trouble discriminating
between the parts about himself (many of which Morris made up) and
the parts about Reagan (none of which he made up). Despite what you
cannot escape having heard, ``Dutch'' is a wonderful book, at least
if you are interested in what happened in America during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It also is a superlative read, a page-turner (a first cousin to
Doris Kearns Goodwin's ``The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys'') whose
airport sales will keep it going long after the pecksniffs, rivals,
and self-interested pleaders against it have returned to their day
jobs. It is beautifully illustrated as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, ``Dutch'' employs several novelistic devices that makes you
glad to read and think, beginning with its dedication to the
short-lived Christine Reagan, infant daughter of Reagan and his
first wife, actress Jame Wyman. The most famous of these artifices
is a semi-fictional narrator named Edmund Morris, who, thirty years
older than the author, turns out to have gone to college with
``Dutch'' (Reagan's boyhood nickname), to have folowed him to
Hollywood and who, only on the last page of the book, discloses a
momentous secret about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   True, it is a daring technique. It produces occasional moments
of vertigo, until you discover that it is the sensibility of the
storyteller that matters, not his biographical situation. As Morris
says, ``Everything that the narrator tells is true.'' So what does
it matter that when the writer wants to draw to the reader's
attention a particularily apposite passage from the radical
sociologist C. Wright Mills it is the narrator who says he has read
the book, rather than the writer himself?
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Morris is no more than a convenient proxy for the
biographer's access to eyewitness testimony or the best available
Educated Guess, then and now. So the effect is of a pool reporter
plunging in and out of the details of Ronald Reagan's early life,
his years in Hollywood and as a pitchman for General Electric, as
governor of California, then settling down in its last third to an
account of the presidency itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch'' is not a biography in a conventional sense, in other
words, but rather an interpretative account of a life by a
crackerjack student of character. Dozens of historians and
biographers in the coming decades will work over the Reagan years.
Many will be policy wonks, well-equipped to interpret what happened
and why. None will come closer than Morris to the man himself, both
literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   (For all the accusations of bad faith, he is scrupulous to
describe his actual relationship to his subject. In fact he begins
his book with an account of the trio of dinners that led to his
engagement as ``authorized biographer'' _ a rhetorical ploy whose
effect is to remind the reader of the complexity of the world of
presidential biography.)
</P>
<P>
   I have long been among those who have thought that 1980 was a
great turning point in US politics, comparable in many ways to 1932
and the advent of the New Deal. What happened wasn't simply that
Reagan was elected, or that the Republicans won leadership of the
Senate, but rather that a watershed had been reached. Rivers flowed
the other way on the far side. To attribute this to Ronald Reagan
(or worse, to Margaret Thatcher) is simple-minded. And yet what
Reagan (and Thatcher) did and said mattered greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Morris sums up his view this way: ``But for his reluctance to
boast, he might already be considered great, on the achievements of
his first term alone. An overnight resurgence of American
patriotism and positivity; a rethinking of old attitudes toward the
government as provider; an assertion of popular rights on the
federal shop floor, and on the federal bench; a declaration of
moral war on the Soviet Union, plus a perfect willingness to
bankrupt it by force of military spending; a rebalancing of
executive power against the legislature; and a transferral of
`compassion' from welfare to the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morris is also better aware than most that the problem of
audience lies at the heart of the Reagan presidency. As the Globe's
Mark Feeney has written, ``To some he is one of the century's
giants, to others a laughable doofus.'' Morris' achievement is to
set Reagan fairly and firmly in context that the reader once again
can judge for her or himself, at a distance of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   So Morris doesn't spend as much time on tax cuts as Robert
Bartley of The Wall Street Journal editorial page would prefer. He
doesn't devote enough attention for my taste to the ``yellow rain''
episode of the first term, in which the State Department formally
accused the Soviet Union of conducting biological warfare in Laos,
presenting samples that turned out on closer examination to be bee
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what Morris succeeds in communicating is a crucial
aspect of Reagan's approach to these matters, as when he describes
the peroration of the first inaugural address _ in which a young
doughboy of the American Expeditionary Force in 1917 vows to work,
save, sacrifice, endure, ``as if the issue of the whole struggle
depended on me alone,'' only to wind up buried in Arlington
National Cemetery across the Potomac. It's another example of
Reagan's ``Daliesque ability to bend reality to his purposes,''
Morris writes. In fact the soldier is buried in Bloomer, Wis., but
``Nobody who knows Reagan doubts that young Treptow lies forever in
some Arlington in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the image of Reagan which Morris seeks to convey is
not the second-class Hollywood movie star, not the union politician
or corporate mouthpiece but rather the summer lifeguard who as a
young man pulled no fewer than 77 swimmers from the tricky currents
of Illinois' Rock River. ``Someday,'' concludes the fictional
Edmund Morris, ``I hope, America might acknowledge her . . . debt
to the Old Lifeguard who rescued her in a time of poisonous despair
. . .'' The lifeguard's trade is in fact a curious mixture of
posturing punctuated by daring. This is a wonderful book.

KLEIN SHOPS AROUND FOR MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calvin Klein Inc. is shopping for a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   The New York fashion house, which became legendary in the '70s
and '80s for its provocative advertising and signature designer
jeans, announced that it is considering a merger or strategic
alliance as a means to bolster its international business and brand
name.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid a flurry of such deals in the fashion world.
Prada recently bought a controlling interest in Jil Sander and
Helmut Lang. Gucci was recently acquired by Pinault-Printemps
Redoute of Paris, and now Fendi is reportedly being wooed by
several industry suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the mergers are coming at a time when brand names
are less relevant to many consumers who aren't willing to pay top
dollar for clothing. ``Today, most shoppers feel that they can be
very well dressed without going broke in the process,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a New Jersey
forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big companies like Calvin Klein are realizing that to make
themselves more competitive, they have to prune and pare their
overhead to become more affordable . . . The way to do that is to
merge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Calvin Klein brand has matured beyond its heyday
in the 1980s _ when racy ads such as the ones with model Brooke
Shields (``Nothing comes between me and my Calvins'') had everybody
talking. These days, competitors like Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, Banana
Republic, FUBU, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger are dominating the
sportswear market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his jeans business, Calvin Klein has lost market share to
Ralph and Tommy over the last two years,'' said Josie Esquivel, an
apparel analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. ``Tommy
and Ralph have also been very aggressive (in their) women's
business. I haven't seen that with Calvin Klein.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge for Klein and every other fashion house,
she said, is that operating in the industry has become much more
expensive. Many retailers are requiring suppliers pay for
advertising and in-store shops as well as take back or pay for
merchandise not selling. What's more, retailers aren't increasing
the square footage they give to design houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your product isn't the one that consumers are running
after, it becomes very tough,'' she said. ``If you're going to
grow, you have to find another channel of distribution to sell into
or open a bunch of stores. But that takes a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment, but in a statement released
this week said, ``We have made tremendous progress in recent years
in building our brand . . . now is the ideal time to consider
strategic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the outcome of this review may be, the company will
continue to build on its powerful competitive position in its
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein is a private company that doesn't release financial
figures but industry sources estimate its annual revenues are more
than $2 billion, including sales of apparel, cosmetics, and home
furnishings. Klein founded the company in 1968 with a childhood
friend from the Bronx named Barry Schwartz, who is now its chairman
and chief executive. Their combined initial investment was $10,000.
Klein and Schwartz each own 43 percent of the company, with the
rest held in a family trust.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said numerous companies could be interested in
buying or investing in Calvin Klein, including a competitor, a
retailer, or even a high-tech firm or an entertainment or media
conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Julian, a fashion trend analyst for New York ad agency
Fallon McElligott, ``The brand is globally recognized. The image is
well maintained. I think the business has a lot of potential to
grow.''

DISPUTE OVER WHO SHOULD BE FREED DELAYS PRISONER RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Peace efforts hit a snag Friday when Israel delayed
a release of Palestinian prisoners after a dispute with the
Palestinians over who should be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord, signed
last month, Israel was supposed to have released 151 prisoners
Friday, after a joint committee of Palestinians and Israelis had
agreed on their names.
</P>
<P>
   But a meeting between the two sides on Thursday night reached an
impasse when negotiators failed to agree on a prisoner list that
the Israelis drew up.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid the release of long-serving prisoners who have
killed or seriously wounded Israelis, the Israeli team submitted a
list that included some prisoners who were serving short terms or
whose terms have nearly ended.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are Muslim militants from the Hamas and Islamic Holy
War movements and people who committed offenses after Sept. 13,
1993, when the Oslo accords were signed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had previously resisted freeing Islamic militants, and
the agreement ruled out the release of prisoners who had committed
offenses after the Oslo accords had been signed. But Israeli
officials said they were compelled to include such prisoners to
meet the required quota of 151 without releasing people ``with
blood on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are avoiding releasing prisoners whose offenses are
particularly serious,'' said Public Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis whose relatives have been killed by Palestinians or who
have been wounded by Palestinian attacks have been lobbying the
government not to release prisoners who have killed or maimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a separation between freeing prisoners and
peace,'' said Shlomo Kalmanovich, a Jewish settler whose face was
disfigured by a firebomb thrown at his car in the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians say the Israelis are violating the latest
agreement by seeking to free prisoners who committed offenses after
the Oslo accords. They insist that the freed prisoners should
include 47 longer-serving inmates from the ranks of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people carried out attacks but are now enthusiastic
supporters of the peace process,'' Ziyad Abu Zayyad, a Palestinian
lawmaker, said in a radio interview. ``Are we going to be prisoners
of the past?''

   The dispute over the release caused the second delay this week
in carrying out the new agreement. A safe-passage route through
Israel between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank was supposed to
have opened last Sunday, but disagreements on security
arrangements, which were finally resolved, have delayed the opening
until next week.

 &HT;    Hasek, Sabres call on Atlanta
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Late November should be a wonderful time of year for a
hockey team to be in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when that team is based in Buffalo. Bad opponent.
Warm sun. Good combination.
</P>
<P>
   But to say Darcy Regier's day was ruined on a Sabres' trip to
sunny Florida early last season would be like saying a 100-mph
slapshot to the forehead could sting a little. Goalie Dominik Hasek
told the Buffalo general manager he was going to retire after this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself not to get too close to the water,'' Regier
said. ``The next thing I thought was, `Why?' I was just trying to
understand the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Regier now has a better understanding of why Hasek, the world's
best goaltender, will retire. He merely is relieved he was able to
talk the Czech native into playing one more season this year. The
Sabres, who visit the Thrashers tonight at Philips Arena, reached
the Stanley Cup finals last year before losing in six games to
Dallas on a disputed goal in triple overtime. They were that close
to a Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, Hasek gives them the best chance to get back to the
finals. Some Buffalo players don't deny the perception that the
team has a one year window of opportunity. ``Some of our guys have
it in their minds that if we don't win this year we're not going to
have the opportunity because Dominik's gone,'' right winger Rob Ray
said. ``But I don't believe that. It would nice to win this year
for him. I just hope people don't think that we can't win next year
without Dominik.''
</P>
<P>
   Regier doesn't want his players to believe that and says he
doesn't believe it himself. While Hasek's retirement is potentially
traumatic, the Sabres are better equipped than most to handle it.
The roster is blessed with speed and youth and there are two touted
goalie prospects in the system: Martin Biron and Mika Noronen, a
first-round pick two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they want to do as well as they can while Hasek is
there, but they have a very good team,'' said Thrashers right
winger Nelson Emerson, whose Ottawa team was frustrated by Hasek in
the playoffs last year. ``When you go to the Cup finals, you can't
say it's just because of the goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Regier said, ``We were going to try to win it this year whether
Dom was here or not. But I think we've positioned ourselves very
well the last few years to prepare for this. When we took Noronen,
I think we all had a sense that Dom wasn't going to play more than
a few more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people who expect that we're going to drop off the
face off the earth when Dom retires are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who desires to kick back and raise his kids in the Czech
Republic, was in goal Friday night when the Sabres had their home
opener against Washington. Coach Lindy Ruff would not tip his hand
on whether the goalie would play consecutive nights, but Regier
said, ``All you have to do is look at how many games he played last
year. If I were guessing, I'd say he'll play'' tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek started 64 of the Sabres' 82 regular-season games last
season. Backup Dwayne Roloson didn't make his first start until
Jan. 2. With five Vezina trophies, two MVPs, a gold medal and the
NHL's leading saves percentage for six straight years on Hasek's
resume, there's no reason for the team to save him.
</P>
<P>
   With the Thrashers struggling to score goals, there are other
faces they would rather stare at tonight. Atlanta defenseman Darryl
Shannon, who played for Buffalo for three and a half seasons, said,
``The thing I'll always remember most is not so much a particular
save but the other team almost laughing and shaking their head in
disbelief how the puck didn't go into the net.''
</P>
<P>
   For one more year, anyway.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did you ever order the ``Extreme Carver'' sandwich at
Boston Market? Have you pre-ordered from Amazon.com one of the new
books about that Australian yacht race caught in the 1998 storm
that killed six people? Does your wardrobe include any of Ralph
Lauren's RLX ``technical'' athletic gear, Donna Karan's Ducati line
of motocross-inspired men's wear or a Timex Expedition watch, which
looks remarkably like a regular Timex except it has the word
``expedition'' on it?
</P>
<P>
   A ``yes'' to any or all these questions could mean that you are
one of those high-octane outdoorsy types who compete in extreme
sports, race expensive foreign motorcycles and relish testing their
mettle against the forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   More probably, it means you've thought about doing these things.
You've read best-selling books about inclement weather (``A Perfect
Storm,'' ``Isaac's Storm''), maybe got a subscription to Outside
magazine or once wore hiking boots to work on casual Friday. You've
stood beneath soul-sucking fast-food fluorescent lighting and said
to yourself, I may be a consumer of processed poultry products, but
I identify with tattooed, body-pierced, physically imperiling,
limit-pushing extreme life styles.
</P>
<P>
   For every thrill-seeking weekend warrior, countless more
armchair adventurers are romanticizing risk-takers when their own
lives have never been more risk-free.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are engaged in an extreme competition of their own,
rushing to load up their waterproof, coldproof, heatproof
active-wear with trademark high-tech fabrics. Through an endless
supply of nonfiction nail biters and extreme-sports Web sites
literally wired into the athletes' heart rates, almost everyone can
live vicariously on the edge in the comfort of their own La-Z-Boys,
where the severest hardships are a dim halogen bulb or a slow
modem.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140,000 visitors will have trekked through the
American Museum of Natural History to see ``The Endurance:
Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition'' by the time it closes
Monday. The show chronicles the intense hardships experienced by
the 28-man crew of Sir Ernest Shackleton's failed voyage to the
South Pole in 1914. Many of the museum's trustees had opposed
``Shackleton,'' saying that the voyage yielded no significant
scientific discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an adventure story, and there was very little science
in it,'' Dr. Ross McPhee, a co-curator of the exhibition, said.
``It was a disaster. They never got to Antarctica.'' McPhee
admitted the show had very little to do with natural history and
likened it to a B-movie, complete with pulse-quickening silent
cinematography. ``By the end of it, you really feel kind of
thrashed,'' he continued. ``You've gone from climax to climax. And
you may not have known what the ending was, so there's that release
of tension when you find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 130-year-old museum has never sounded so sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Books on similarly doomed expeditions, both past and present,
keep on coming. Four books on the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race that
left six sailors dead. Five next year on George Mallory, the
legendary English climber who disappeared on Mount Everest in 1924
and whose body was found, in May, preserved high on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Of this mania for adventure narratives, the president of Simon &AMP;
Schuster's trade division, David Rosenthal, said: ``I think people
are looking for a dose of reality in their lives. These books do
deal with life and death, and not like `ER' or a disaster movie.
There's a lot of, `There but for the grace of God go I.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks are in sedentary careers and have not had time
between college and work to traipse off and climb a mountain. These
books are the best antidote to finding yourself married with two
kids at 32 and living in Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal has been publishing this kind of stuff for years,
starting with the gonzo journalism of Tim Cahill and Hunter
Thompson in the 1970s to the harrowing Everest saga of Jon
Krakauer's ``Into Thin Air,'' the book credited with setting off
the late-1990s avalanche of ``extreme'' nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion has come a little late to the campfire, but appears to
be making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cover of Women's Wear Daily, with the headline ``Going
to Extremes,'' showed a model in orange overalls and a white down
vest clutching a snowboard _ all made by Burton. The inside pages
displayed clothing by Prada and Ralph Lauren fabricated with
technical-sounding materials: Teflon, Primaloft, Tactel, Supplex,
Colmax and those old standbys of the urban pioneer, Gore-Tex and
Polarfleece.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Wand, vice president of RLX, an offshoot of Polo Ralph
Lauren, said his was ``primarily a performance line,'' designed for
biking, snowboarding and the likes, and is sold at sporting goods
stores. That won't prevent nonbikers and nonsnowboarders from
wearing it, though.
</P>
<P>
   Wand added, ``The reality is that they might also be getting
great use out of these products just walking around or because they
think something looks amazing because it's a technical piece.''
</P>
<P>
   At Donna Karan, there is less concern with projecting an image
of authenticity. The DKNY Ducati line, with its motorcycle-theme
pants ($900) and jackets ($1,200) in stretch Kevlar, is ``primarily
a fashion statement,'' said Fraser Conlon, a senior director of
men's wear at the company. (Ms. Karen's husband, Stephan Weiss, has
long raced Ducatis.)
</P>
<P>
   Burberry has also gone rugged. The label has moved beyond
draping supermodels in its trademark tartan to celebrating the
company's roots in colonial-era outerwear. A sepia-toned booklet
from the Burberry public relations department includes reprints of
advertisements extolling the invention of gabardine inn 1879 by the
company's founder, Thomas Burberry, and a letter of praise for the
material by Roald Amundsen. Next to that kind of endorsement a Gap
ad saying ``James Dean wore khakis'' sounds pretty lame.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the new Burberry styles aren't worn for anything more
dangerous than an assault on the north face of Madison Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   A central tenet of marketers and ad agencies is that consumer
behavior is ``aspirational.'' A 9-year-old girl watches television
shows about teen-agers because she wants to be one. Walker Smith,
the president of the market research firm Yankelovich Partners,
said, ``Driving an SUV, you're saying I have an extreme attitude
and those are things that resonate with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Yankelovich poll asked people to respond to the
statement, ``I like to imagine myself doing something I know I
wouldn't dare do.'' The number who agreed was 53 percent, up from
45 percent in 1995. Another question asked people if they like to
engage in activities regarded as dangerous. That number was up,
too, but only 2 percentage points (from 23 to 25) over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad strokes,'' Smith said, ``this push toward extremity
is one manifestation of the absence of the middle as an
aspirational ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Esoteric sports that were once strictly participatory have
become spectator events watched by millions. ESPN 2 covers
competitions that would once have been viewed only by nervous
friends and relatives: off-road skateboarding, sky surfing,
chain-saw championships. Web sites like Quokka.com and
MountainZone.com hook up climbers and long-distance desert runners
with digital cameras, pulse monitors and communications equipment.
E-mail messages to Quokka describe hours spent staring at computer
screens as daredevils scaled the Great Trango Tower, a 6,000-foot
sheer rock wall in Pakistan, in July.
</P>
<P>
   The newest magazine aimed at this market is National Geographic
Adventure, edited by John Rasmus, a former editor of Outside and
Men's Journal. ``We want to capture the purity of what's implied by
the name adventure,'' said Rasmus, whose National Geographic
spinoff was started in April. His pages may contain features on
``exploraphernalia,'' but Rasmus, himself a hiker and kayaker,
takes his adventure seriously. He said his magazine's approach is
``not about irony'' and is careful to refer to the Himalaya
Mountains by their local pronunciation: ``the hee-MAL-yah.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus said focus groups indicate that his audience is ``very
active'' and was reluctant to acknowledge an armchair contingent.
Hal Espen, the editor of Outside, took a more realistic view. A
recent reader survey showed that about 15 percent of subscribers
``have tried some level of fairly ambitious mountaineering,'' he
said. ``Far more than 15 percent of our readers are as fascinated
with vicariously participating in stories about mountaineering.''
</P>
<P>
   An overdue parody of the genre appeared in the men's magazine
Details in the August issue. Wil Hylton wrote of training for a
serious climb in South America by drinking and smoking beforehand
and then continuing to do so on the way up.
(OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</P>
<P>
   There are cultural antecedents for our obsession with these
kinds of stories. From the middle of the last century into the turn
of this one, an industrializing America devoured the literature of
adventure, risk and physical danger in penny-dreadful accounts of
men driven to cannibalism, the great novels of Herman Melville and
the wilderness stories of Jack London. The view of nature had
ceased to be redemptive (the Romantics' idea) and become Darwinian,
as George Stade, a professor of English at Columbia University,
observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the last century there was a fusion of adventure
with literalism and realism and London and instrument of that,'' he
said, recalling a Jack London story in which a man caught in a
winter storm kills his dog and puts his hands inside the animals'
body to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway kept the man vs. nature tradition alive long
after the rest of literature had left it to Hollywood. There is a
George Clooney movie in production of ``A Perfect Storm,''
Sebastian Junger's novel of a sailor's losing battle with the sea.
But for the most part, the current armchair adventurism has
remained a literary, not cinematic, form. Rosenthal suggested that
``people are so used to being transfixed by visual imagery, there
may be some desire to conjure things up in the mind's eye again and
put the imagination to some test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that can be tested at room temperature.

   &QL;  &UR; NASA GETS BUDGET BOOST, BUT NOT WITHOUT CAVEATS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Jonathan Lipman &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 States News Service &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 -- The final version of the spending bill
containing NASA funding will include, not a cut, but a $74 million
boost to the space agency. However, the lawmakers who handled the
bill sent a clear message about their priorities within NASA, and
several programs will be left with less funding.
</P>
<P>
   NASA and congressional sources said that the House-Senate
conference report on the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies
Appropriations bill would contain $13.65 billion for NASA, a total
of $74 million above President Clinton's request for fiscal year
2000, and $25 million below the 1999 level.
</P>
<P>
   The original House version of the spending bill included $900
million in cuts to the agency, prompting a months-long lobbying
effort by space supporters to restore NASA funding. The Senate
version of the bill fully funded the president's request, but
shifted $120 million out of space science into space transportation
and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Subcommittee Chairman Kit Bond, R-Mo., and others
predicted that the bill would sail quickly through both chambers
and said that the president has already agreed to sign the bill
late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional sources - speaking to States News Service and
space.com under condition of anonymity - confirmed reports that
several space science programs will be reduced or eliminated. The
total cut to space science is $45 million, said Jim Simmons, an
aide to House Subcommittee Chairman, Jim Walsh, R-N.Y. Of that, $30
million will be taken from NASA's ``supporting research and
technology'' account, which funds a number of smaller sub-orbital
and technology programs.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Triana satellite will face an independent
review of its scientific value, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had no comment on the proposed budget available by Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the additions in the budget went to the aeronautics
programs, sources said, mostly to future space launch technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for some of the Explorer and Discovery programs will be
cut, and all funding for the $20 million LightSar program will be
cut, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cuts came from programs that have been delayed due
to launching difficulties, Simmons said. Therefore, the cuts will
not really affect those programs, because they will be able to
survive on existing funding. Other money came from programs that
NASA has canceled, such as the failed Mars Climate Orbiter.
</P>
<P>
   Political maneuvering for the 2000 presidential race prompted a
provision in the bill will prevent NASA's Triana satellite from
launching sooner than 2001, if it gets to launch at all.
</P>
<P>
   The provision calls on the independent National Academy of
Science to review the controversial satellite's science objectives.
NASA must suspend all work on the program for 60 to 90 days for the
academy's review, which Congress will then use to decide the fate
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Triana passes the review, NASA is prohibited from
launching until January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to take the politics out of it,'' Simmons said.
``It's been coming back to us that, even though [NASA] promised not
to launch it until 2001, there was a push for an October flight,
which would have been in time for [Vice President Al] Gore's
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite has repeatedly come under fire from congressional
Republicans, particularly Science Committee Chairman Rep. James
Sensenbrenner, who derisively nicknamed it the ``Gore-sat.'' The
concept for the craft, which would provide a picture of earth
24-hours-a-day over the Internet, reportedly came to the vice
president in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has since added magnetic and radiation survey equipment to
the satellite, but Sensenbrenner has contended that the scientific
value is still minimal and that the mission can do nothing new. He
has also charged that the agency is launching Triana to please
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Triana can stand based on its own scientific merits'' in any
scientific review, NASA spokesman David Steitz said. ``We've said
that since the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is already campaigning hard for the presidency. An October
launch could give him a big victory over some of his Republican
critics just before the final November election, assuming Gore is
the eventual Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore would want to make a big announcement at the end of
October,'' a GOP congressional aide said. ``If it's a good program,
than let it stand on its own merits, otherwise don't play politics
with the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The October launch was just to take advantage of an available
shuttle flight, STS-107, Steitz said. While NASA has not been
officially notified of the provision because it is not yet law, the
agency ``will, of course, abide by the will of Congress,'' he said.
</P>

   The conference committee, faced with large differences between
the bills and a presidential veto threat, negotiated down to the
wire on the controversial spending bill. Lawmakers repeatedly
pushed back a public meeting later and later, and the final report
had not even been printed up when the meeting convened late
Thursday night.

   ``We cut a deal with the White House about 25 minutes before the
meeting,'' one aide said.

A NEW GENERATION OF HUMANISTIC JUDAISM ;  CHURCHES BACK NUCLEAR
TEST BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A big test faced by voluntary organizations is whether they can
pass their convictions to a second generation. If not, they
probably face extinction, at least until someone comes along to
revive their core ideas.
</P>
<P>
   So it should not have been surprising that Rabbi Sherwin Wine,
in an interview this week, voiced satisfaction in looking forward
to an event at his temple in suburban Detroit. The movement he
launched, a Judaism focused on human ``power and responsibility''
without reference to God, was about to ordain its first rabbi, a
woman who grew up in the movement and was formally trained in its
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Educated in Judaism's Reform branch, Wine struck out on his own
to found the Birmingham Temple in Farmington Hills, Mich., in 1963.
It is now a cornerstone of the Humanistic Judaism movement.
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, is a Judaism based on two premises, that Judaism
is the historic culture of the Jewish people ``and therefore is
more than a religion,'' and that its power is ``not to be found in
an external source, but in human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, preparations were under way to ordain Tamara
Kolton, a 29-year-old licensed clinical psychologist who was bat
mitzvahed in his congregation. Ms. Kolton, the congregation's
associate rabbi, is the first graduate of a rabbinic program run by
an institute affiliated with a federation of secular humanist
Jewish groups. (A brochure defines a humanist rabbi as a teacher,
counselor, pastor and ``expert'' in Judaism.)
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony on Friday night had been designed to include Jewish
poetry and music, reading of philosophical reflections and a
statement of Ms. Kolton's commitment to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Wine, 71, drew widespread attention after he founded the
Birmingham Temple. News coverage of the controversy his views
provoked could sometimes be bold. A newspaper headline identified
him as ``the atheist rabbi.'' He was flooded with speaking
invitations from the curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that first year, I must have gone out at least 100 times''
to lecture outside Detroit, he said. ``I was invited by groups who
were interested in the controversy,'' he said. ``And then I was
invited by people who were interested in forming groups of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he established the Society for Humanistic Judaism,
which has about 35 affiliated congregations in the United States
and Canada. About 20 other local groups belong to a sister
association, the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations. There
are independent groups in Israel, Russia, and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of community is a function of the need of people to
feel connected to other people who share their convictions,'' Wine
said. ``We above all as humanists need communities. We don't have
God to rely on.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York affiliate is the City Congregation for Humanistic
Judaism, which holds a monthly Sabbath meeting, and Sunday programs
of Torah study and adults' and children's education, at the Village
Community School, 242 West 10th St. The congregation now has 70
households affiliated, said Myrna Baron, its past president. When
it was begun eight years ago, it had only six people, who met in a
living room.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baron went to Michigan to participate in a meeting at Wine's
temple called Colloquium '99, a program of discussions among
members of the humanist Jewish movement. Ms. Kolton's ordination
was timed to occur during the event. ``It's a wonderful milestone
for us,'' Ms. Baron said.

<P>
   Churches Back Nuclear Test Ban
</P>
<P>
   Before the U.S. Senate opened debate Friday on whether to ratify
a controversial treaty that would ban underground nuclear tests,
several religious leaders, representing Protestant, Roman Catholic,
Jewish and Quaker organizations declared their backing of it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, half a dozen of them, originally scheduled to join
Republican Sen. James Jeffords of Vermont at a Capitol Hill press
conference, went instead to a White House gathering organized to
show support for the measure, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
Clinton signed the document in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among those declaring their organizations' support were the Rev.
Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches; Bishop John Glynn, auxiliary bishop of the Catholic
church's Military Archdiocese, and Mark Pelavin, associate director
of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   But the treaty faces stiff opposition in the Senate, where
critics have said its provisions might threaten the safety and
reliability of U.S. nuclear stockpiles. Six former Republican
defense secretaries have come out against it, although it is
supported by Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark, N.J.,
chairman of the Catholic bishops' International Policy Committee,
sent a letter to senators, saying the bishops favored ratification.
``The moral credibility of the United States in urging other
nations to forgo nuclear weapons depends on its ratification of
this treaty,'' he wrote.

LACK OF WARNING SYSTEM CITED IN REPORT ON TRAIN ACCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Moving with unusual speed after Britain's worst train
crash in decades, a government panel confirmed Friday that a
commuter train had caused the crash here by running a red signal
light straight into the path of a speeding intercity express.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, police initially said that at least 70 people
died in the crash. But Friday they said that 30 fatalities had been
confirmed and that 64 people remained unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The accident on the approaches to Paddington Station horrified
the millions of Britons who commute by rail each day and fueled an
emotional debate over safety three years after the state sold its
railroad system to private investors.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary government report from the Health and Safety
Executive found that the accident could have been avoided if the
track operators had installed a special warning system at the
now-notorious signal 109 near Ladbroke Grove in western London, the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Signal 109, known among rail engineers as difficult to see, had
been due to be fitted with the warning system, but not until
December 2003, the report said. The agency ordered Railtrack, the
company that owns tracks, signals and stations, to upgrade the
signal before using it again.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether private companies have trimmed safety
budgets in their pursuit of profit goes to the core of a debate
that has consumed newspapers, television talk-shows and ordinary
conversation since the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The government report did little to comfort travelers abruptly
confronted with a sense that public safety comes second to profit
in what Philip Stephens, a columnist in The Financial Times, called
``a culture that has ceased to weigh carefully the public against
the individual interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain has grown accustomed to public squalor,'' Stephens
wrote. ``Until, that is, something like this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The report seemed just as damning. It said the Automatic Train
Protection system, which is widely used in continental Europe, had
been installed on the First Great Western intercity express that
was heading into London at 8:11 a.m., but was switched off because
it was ``not operational.''
</P>
<P>
   The equipment would not have prevented the crash, the report
said, but should have been functioning. First Greater Western was
accused of a similar lapse in an crash on that stretch two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, railroad executives have been accused of
shying from the cost of installing special devices across the
network, saying that the devices are unreliable and expensive and
that they are quite likely to cost some $3.3 billion to install.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, rail operators have begun to install the
technologically different _ and cheaper _ Train Protection Warning
System. Both systems are designed to brake trains automatically if
they run into danger.
</P>
<P>
   Raising another safety question, the report said both trains
were carrying diesel fuel in tanks that apparently ruptured,
spreading what rescuers have termed an inferno from the point of
impact. Even Friday, rescuers had still not searched through a
first-class buffet car on the intercity express described by
rescuers as being knee-deep in ash after a fireball incinerated it
and the people inside.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, official inquiries into rail accidents take
months or even years to complete. But Friday's findings were
released quickly in response to a public clamor for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has experienced anything worse,'' said Vic Coleman,
Britain's chief inspector of railways, ``Everyone has been deeply
affected and there's been a sense of deep shock.''

 &HT;    HAWKS NOTEBOOK: Small forwards among walking wounded
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. _ You can't be too thin or too wealthy _ or
have too many small forwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks can add the last part to an old axiom after LaPhonso
Ellis and Chris Crawford spent the morning practice on stationary
bikes. That left second-year player Roshown McLeod as the only
healthy member of the team's most competitive position.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis aggravated a calf strain he suffered a few weeks ago and
stayed out as a precaution. ``He felt a twinge,'' trainer Chris
Tucker said, ``so we're being cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was taken for X-rays Friday morning after banging his
right hand in Thursday night's scrimmage. The X-ray showed no
evidence of a fracture at the tender spot at the base of his thumb,
but Tucker said he might seek another opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Fans will remember Crawford scoring 26 points against the Knicks
in the playoffs even though he had a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He had a similar reaction to this injury. ``Shoot it,'' he told
Tucker, referring to a pain-killing injection. ``Shoot it, and I'll
get back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough kid,'' Lenny Wilkens said. ``That's what we love
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford signed a six-year contract in August worth about $18
million.
</P>
<P>
   The staff is impressed with Ellis' work ethic. He was the
hardest-working veteran during the summer, seeking a quicker
release for his jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Practice notes
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens shortened practices Thursday night and Friday morning so
players could get the spring back in their legs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, he threw the ball to Dikembe Mutombo. If Mutombo
could make two free throws, the team could skip sprint drills.
Calmly, the big man dropped in one and then the other, becoming
very popular.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Hawks went 90 minutes in the morning to prepare for
a hard evening scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks will hold a free public scrimmage at 6 p.m. today at
UT-Chattanooga's Roundhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll divide up into competitive teams and go four 10-minute
quarters,'' Wilkens said.
</P>
<P>
   They will finish here Sunday morning, practice at Philips Arena
on Monday and fly to Albany, N.Y., for the first exhibition,
against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Alan Henderson was among several Hawks veterans surprised by
Isaiah Rider's questions about the team's ability to contend in the
East. ``I think we've got just as good a chance as anybody,''
Henderson said. ``This is a good team.'' . . . When fatigued,
rookie center-forward Cal Bowdler still has tightness in his back.
The problem surfaced in summer camp when the team's rookies and
free agents practiced twice daily and then played three games in as
many nights. . . . At the moment, center Mutombo and power forward
Henderson are the only two who are guaranteed a starting position,
and Lorenzen Wright is forcing Henderson to play better. Ellis
holds an advantage at small forward. Jim Jackson is ahead of the
late-arriving Rider at shooting guard. And rookie point guard Jason
Terry has shown brilliance, particularly with a withering spin move
from the top of the key, but nine-year-man Bimbo Coles makes fewer
mistakes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Did you ever order the ``Extreme Carver'' sandwich at
Boston Market? Have you pre-ordered from Amazon.com one of the new
books about that Australian yacht race caught in the 1998 storm
that killed six people? Does your wardrobe include any of Ralph
Lauren's RLX ``technical'' athletic gear, Donna Karan's Ducati line
of motocross-inspired men's wear or a Timex Expedition watch, which
looks remarkably like a regular Timex except it has the word
``expedition'' on it?
</P>
<P>
   A ``yes'' to any or all these questions could mean that you are
one of those high-octane outdoorsy types who compete in extreme
sports, race expensive foreign motorcycles and relish testing their
mettle against the forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   More probably, it means you've thought about doing these things.
You've read best-selling books about inclement weather (``A Perfect
Storm,'' ``Isaac's Storm''), maybe got a subscription to Outside
magazine or once wore hiking boots to work on casual Friday. You've
stood beneath soul-sucking fast-food fluorescent lighting and said
to yourself, I may be a consumer of processed poultry products, but
I identify with tattooed, body-pierced, physically imperiling,
limit-pushing extreme life styles.
</P>
<P>
   For every thrill-seeking weekend warrior, countless more
armchair adventurers are romanticizing risk-takers when their own
lives have never been more risk-free.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are engaged in an extreme competition of their own,
rushing to load up their waterproof, coldproof, heatproof
active-wear with trademark high-tech fabrics. Through an endless
supply of nonfiction nail biters and extreme-sports Web sites
literally wired into the athletes' heart rates, almost everyone can
live vicariously on the edge in the comfort of their own La-Z-Boys,
where the severest hardships are a dim halogen bulb or a slow
modem.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140,000 visitors will have trekked through the
American Museum of Natural History to see ``The Endurance:
Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition'' by the time it closes
Monday. The show chronicles the intense hardships experienced by
the 28-man crew of Sir Ernest Shackleton's failed voyage to the
South Pole in 1914. Many of the museum's trustees had opposed
``Shackleton,'' saying that the voyage yielded no significant
scientific discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an adventure story, and there was very little science
in it,'' Dr. Ross McPhee, a co-curator of the exhibition, said.
``It was a disaster. They never got to Antarctica.'' McPhee
admitted the show had very little to do with natural history and
likened it to a B-movie, complete with pulse-quickening silent
cinematography. ``By the end of it, you really feel kind of
thrashed,'' he continued. ``You've gone from climax to climax. And
you may not have known what the ending was, so there's that release
of tension when you find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The 130-year-old museum has never sounded so sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Books on similarly doomed expeditions, both past and present,
keep on coming. Four books on the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race that
left six sailors dead. Five next year on George Mallory, the
legendary English climber who disappeared on Mount Everest in 1924
and whose body was found, in May, preserved high on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Of this mania for adventure narratives, the president of Simon &AMP;
Schuster's trade division, David Rosenthal, said: ``I think people
are looking for a dose of reality in their lives. These books do
deal with life and death, and not like `ER' or a disaster movie.
There's a lot of, `There but for the grace of God go I.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks are in sedentary careers and have not had time
between college and work to traipse off and climb a mountain. These
books are the best antidote to finding yourself married with two
kids at 32 and living in Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal has been publishing this kind of stuff for years,
starting with the gonzo journalism of Tim Cahill and Hunter
Thompson in the 1970s to the harrowing Everest saga of Jon
Krakauer's ``Into Thin Air,'' the book credited with setting off
the late-1990s avalanche of ``extreme'' nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion has come a little late to the campfire, but appears to
be making up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   A recent cover of Women's Wear Daily, with the headline ``Going
to Extremes,'' showed a model in orange overalls and a white down
vest clutching a snowboard _ all made by Burton. The inside pages
displayed clothing by Prada and Ralph Lauren fabricated with
technical-sounding materials: Teflon, Primaloft, Tactel, Supplex,
Colmax and those old standbys of the urban pioneer, Gore-Tex and
Polarfleece.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Wand, vice president of RLX, an offshoot of Polo Ralph
Lauren, said his was ``primarily a performance line,'' designed for
biking, snowboarding and the likes, and is sold at sporting goods
stores. That won't prevent nonbikers and nonsnowboarders from
wearing it, though.
</P>
<P>
   Wand added, ``The reality is that they might also be getting
great use out of these products just walking around or because they
think something looks amazing because it's a technical piece.''
</P>
<P>
   At Donna Karan, there is less concern with projecting an image
of authenticity. The DKNY Ducati line, with its motorcycle-theme
pants ($900) and jackets ($1,200) in stretch Kevlar, is ``primarily
a fashion statement,'' said Fraser Conlon, a senior director of
men's wear at the company. (Ms. Karen's husband, Stephan Weiss, has
long raced Ducatis.)
</P>
<P>
   Burberry has also gone rugged. The label has moved beyond
draping supermodels in its trademark tartan to celebrating the
company's roots in colonial-era outerwear. A sepia-toned booklet
from the Burberry public relations department includes reprints of
advertisements extolling the invention of gabardine inn 1879 by the
company's founder, Thomas Burberry, and a letter of praise for the
material by Roald Amundsen. Next to that kind of endorsement a Gap
ad saying ``James Dean wore khakis'' sounds pretty lame.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the new Burberry styles aren't worn for anything more
dangerous than an assault on the north face of Madison Avenue?
</P>
<P>
   A central tenet of marketers and ad agencies is that consumer
behavior is ``aspirational.'' A 9-year-old girl watches television
shows about teen-agers because she wants to be one. Walker Smith,
the president of the market research firm Yankelovich Partners,
said, ``Driving an SUV, you're saying I have an extreme attitude
and those are things that resonate with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Yankelovich poll asked people to respond to the
statement, ``I like to imagine myself doing something I know I
wouldn't dare do.'' The number who agreed was 53 percent, up from
45 percent in 1995. Another question asked people if they like to
engage in activities regarded as dangerous. That number was up,
too, but only 2 percentage points (from 23 to 25) over the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``In broad strokes,'' Smith said, ``this push toward extremity
is one manifestation of the absence of the middle as an
aspirational ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Esoteric sports that were once strictly participatory have
become spectator events watched by millions. ESPN 2 covers
competitions that would once have been viewed only by nervous
friends and relatives: off-road skateboarding, sky surfing,
chain-saw championships. Web sites like Quokka.com and
MountainZone.com hook up climbers and long-distance desert runners
with digital cameras, pulse monitors and communications equipment.
E-mail messages to Quokka describe hours spent staring at computer
screens as daredevils scaled the Great Trango Tower, a 6,000-foot
sheer rock wall in Pakistan, in July.
</P>
<P>
   The newest magazine aimed at this market is National Geographic
Adventure, edited by John Rasmus, a former editor of Outside and
Men's Journal. ``We want to capture the purity of what's implied by
the name adventure,'' said Rasmus, whose National Geographic
spinoff was started in April. His pages may contain features on
``exploraphernalia,'' but Rasmus, himself a hiker and kayaker,
takes his adventure seriously. He said his magazine's approach is
``not about irony'' and is careful to refer to the Himalaya
Mountains by their local pronunciation: ``the hee-MAL-yah.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus said focus groups indicate that his audience is ``very
active'' and was reluctant to acknowledge an armchair contingent.
Hal Espen, the editor of Outside, took a more realistic view. A
recent reader survey showed that about 15 percent of subscribers
``have tried some level of fairly ambitious mountaineering,'' he
said. ``Far more than 15 percent of our readers are as fascinated
with vicariously participating in stories about mountaineering.''
</P>
<P>
   An overdue parody of the genre appeared in the men's magazine
Details in the August issue. Wil Hylton wrote of training for a
serious climb in South America by drinking and smoking beforehand
and then continuing to do so on the way up.
(OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</P>
<P>
   There are cultural antecedents for our obsession with these
kinds of stories. From the middle of the last century into the turn
of this one, an industrializing America devoured the literature of
adventure, risk and physical danger in penny-dreadful accounts of
men driven to cannibalism, the great novels of Herman Melville and
the wilderness stories of Jack London. The view of nature had
ceased to be redemptive (the Romantics' idea) and become Darwinian,
as George Stade, a professor of English at Columbia University,
observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the last century there was a fusion of adventure
with literalism and realism and London and instrument of that,'' he
said, recalling a Jack London story in which a man caught in a
winter storm kills his dog and puts his hands inside the animals'
body to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway kept the man vs. nature tradition alive long
after the rest of literature had left it to Hollywood. There is a
George Clooney movie in production of ``A Perfect Storm,''
Sebastian Junger's novel of a sailor's losing battle with the sea.
But for the most part, the current armchair adventurism has
remained a literary, not cinematic, form. Rosenthal suggested that
``people are so used to being transfixed by visual imagery, there
may be some desire to conjure things up in the mind's eye again and
put the imagination to some test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that can be tested at room temperature.

JOB GROWTH SLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With fewer workers available to fill jobs created in the midst
of a maturing economic expansion, employers' payrolls fell by 8,000
jobs in September and wages jumped.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department officials blamed the job losses on Hurricane
Floyd, which brought destruction and a halt to commerce in some
Southeastern states before passing out in the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But economists saw more enduring causes for the job losses,
which may be a source of concern about the economy. The jobs report
contained evidence that a tight labor market has begun pushing up
wages. Hourly wages rose a half-percentage point in September _ a
jump that translates to 6 percent wage increases annually. Wages
rose 7 cents, to $13.37 an hour, compared with a 2-cent increase in
August.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the reduction in employment levels may not be a
result of a natural slowdown, which would be welcome in an economy
that may be overheating, economists said. It may be caused by a
worker shortage that makes it very difficult for employers to hire
the people they need to fill orders and keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically ran out of workers, and once everybody's got a
job it's hard to get employment growth going,'' said David Wyss, an
economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign workers are scarce, employment declined in two
sectors of the economy that have had increasing difficulty finding
workers, the retail and service industries.
</P>
<P>
   A slight drop in employment levels last month _ the first
decline since January 1996 _ had no impact on the unemployment
rate, which was unchanged at 4.2 percent, the US Department of
Labor said in its monthly jobs report.
</P>
<P>
   With jobs plentiful and workers scarce, Jack Mohan, president of
the Boston office of Management Recruiters International, said
employees have become ``more active'' in seeking jobs with better
pay. ``They're getting big raises by moving around,'' Mohan said.
</P>
<P>
   While this is good for workers, William Cheney, John Hancock's
economist, said it could lead to inflation. ``If wages are being
pushed up,'' he said, ``where's the money coming from? Is it going
to come out of companies' profits or are they going to put up their
prices a bit and and produce inflation?''
</P>
<P>
   September's payroll contracted on the heels of a sharp slowdown
in job growth a month earlier. According to revised data released
Friday, only 103,000 jobs were added in August _ less than the
124,000 figure first reported. For much of the year, the economy
had generated 200,000-plus new jobs each month. July's job gains
were 373,000.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the jobs report removes some pressure from the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for a third time this year.
However, if wages continue to rise the Fed's decision may be more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Wyss at Standard &AMP; Poor's said slow job growth again in October
would provide the Federal Open Market Committee with ``a strong
argument'' for not raising interest rates at its next meeting on
Nov. 16. The October jobs report will be released on the first
Friday in November, days before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Fed voted against raising rates. However, Fed
officials warned they are ``especially alert'' to inflation,
particularly upward pressure on wages, and stand ready to increase
rates at the first sign of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite inflation fears, the economy remains robust.
</P>
<P>
   September marks the 18th consecutive month in which the jobless
rate has remained at 4.5 percent or lower, the Labor Department
said. Labor Secretary Alexis Herman noted Friday that the jobless
rate for college grads is now a low 1.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Herman said there are 4 million workers who, ``because of
labor market barriers'' or a lack of day care, transportation, or
elder care, do not work. ``We have to intensify our efforts to
invest in the skilling of more workers,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   High school dropouts, for example, had a 6.9 percent jobless
rate. While white workers saw their unemployment rate fall, black,
Hispanic, and teenage workers' jobless rates were slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
   In September, retailers were hit hardest by the return of
teenagers to high school and college and a lack of workers for
hire. Payrolls in the retail industry shrank by 49,000 jobs in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The services sector, which includes business services, has been
the source of huge job gains for months. But, services hired fewer
workers last month _ 39,000 _ than the average 126,000 jobs
typically added in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing lost 21,000 jobs, but construction employment
gained 21,000.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Department officials blamed the hurricane. Without it,
some 50,000 jobs would have been created in September, the
department said.

 &HT;    Farming issues has Bradley rethinking past stances
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLISLE, Iowa _ Democrat Bill Bradley continued Friday to put
some distance between himself and his Senate record on farm issues,
telling farmers here he would support new federal subsidies to aid
distressed family farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing out on gently sloping corn fields, the former New Jersey
senator called America's family farms part of the ``productive
beauty'' of the American landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we ever lose that, we are going to lose something that is
as deep in America as Thomas Jefferson,'' said Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Farm policy is perhaps the thorniest issue for Bradley as he
seeks to transform himself from a former senator into a national
candidate for president. In the Senate, Bradley voted against
increasing price supports for farmers and for the reduction or
elimination of loans to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Bradley said he would commit an additional $1.2 billion
to put 5.6 million acres of farm land under the federal
conservation reserve program, which pays farmers not to use
environmentally sensitive land.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also proposed a new system of cash payments to farmers
tied to the market price of crops and agriculture products. When
prices dipped below farmers' cost of production _ feed, fertilizer
and maintenance _ farmers would be entitled to subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   After his chat with farmers, Bradley said that he now regretted
voting for the Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, which phased out some
price supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have passed it until they put a safety net in
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His own proposals were not a reversal of his record, he said,
but a ``re-thinking of the issue.'' He noted that his proposals do
more than return subsidies for farmers, by targeting aid to small,
family producers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his campaign, Bradley also did an about face on
federal subsidies for ethanol, the corn-based fuel additive that
annually consumes some 200 million bushels of corn in Iowa and
accounts for 14,000 state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sponsored legislation to phase out the ethanol subsidies
in the Senate, but now he is in favor of continuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore's campaign immediately seized on Bradley's
latest proposals as a ``blatant political attempt to curry
political support in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For 18 years as a United States senator from New Jersey, Bill
Bradley voted against the interest of farmers,'' said Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the decisiveness with which he has advanced other
proposals, such as providing universal health insurance, Bradley
was decidedly more cautious in dealing with the farm issue.
</P>
<P>
   He freely conceded that he didn't know ``a whole lot'' about
agriculture when he began his campaign and that campaigning in Iowa
had been an education. ``I had no sense of what the farm economy
was all about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is offered modestly, but it's offered sincerely,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bradley was asked a question about soy beans. Unable to
answer, he simply shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's host for the day, Joe Dunn, who farms 200 acres and
leases 1,000 acres to other farmers, said he found Bradley sincere
but wasn't ready to commit to the East Coast Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I've ever met him,'' said Dunn, whose
farm has been in his family for 140 years. ``I want to follow this
a little bit more.''

<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Chechen fighters have repulsed Russian forces
from villages along the Terek river in northern Chechnya, in their
first serious resistance since fighting began two weeks ago, a top
Chechen commander said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens started a coordinated attack on several places
along the Terek on Thursday afternoon, said Aslanbek Izmailov,
deputy chief of the cabinet of ministers and a senior commander.
</P>
<P>
   More reinforcements were sent in overnight and secured at least
two villages that had been occupied by Russian forces: Isherskaya,
in the northeast, and Chervlennaya, almost directly north of the
capital, Grozny, Izmailov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians only control the steppe now, we control the
villages,'' he said. The Russians had withdrawn as soon as they
came under attack and lost four armored vehicles in the process at
Chervlennaya, and small arms fire was continuing Friday evening,
said Izmailov. He added that Chechen fighters were digging in.
</P>
<P>
   Now ranged on the steppe north of the villages on the Terek, the
Russian troops have shelled Chechen positions. Heavy ripple
explosions from multiple rocket systems could be heard clearly from
Grozny, some 15 miles away, Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Izmailov estimated that 20,000 Russian troops were now
positioned north of the Terek. They swept into Chechnya two weeks
ago without meeting much resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians said little Friday about the fighting in Chechnya,
but conceded that their casualties are mounting, according to a
Russian general, Valery Manilov, who said some 20 to 30 Russian
soldiers had been killed in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians invaded Chechnya in 1994 to crush a bid for
independence. They withdrew in humiliating defeat 21 months later,
agreeing to defer any decision on Chechnya's status for five years.
Negotiations continued but Chechnya became engulfed in a wave of
crime that has aggravated relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians renewed military action in recent weeks, spurred by
a violent uprising in neighboring Dagestan and bombings that killed
hundreds of people in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had occupied all the land down to the Terek,
roughly a third of the republic, earlier this week, forcing Chechen
fighters to withdraw south across the river.
</P>
<P>
   Izmailov said the Chechens would try to hold the villages,
especially Chervlennaya, which commands the heights over the city
of Grozny, but he expected heavy bombing. ``The men can stand the
shelling, they are digging in,'' he said. ``If it gets too heavy,
then we either have to go forward or back. We can move our
positions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said most civilians had left the area, but the Chechen
government estimated that some 5,000 people, of a population of
50,000, were still in the area north of the Terek.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Chechen leadership was determined to prevent Moscow from
annexing the northern area and setting up its own administration,
he said. Part of Moscow's plan was to enable two Chechens loyal to
Moscow to run for seats in parliamentary elections in December from
the region. The man named to lead the new administration in the
annexed northern part of Chechnya, Malik Saidullayev, was a
traitor, Izmailov said, adding that the Chechen authorities had
confiscated his apartment in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, he said, Russian forces had not advanced from
positions poised on Chechnya's eastern and western borders. The
Russians have concentrated 40 percent of their forces north of the
Terek, Izmailov said. Nevertheless, he remained convinced that
Russia intended to eventually take the whole province.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just checking to see if we would resist,'' said
Izmailov. ``If they see we are weak, then they will move in.''

PUBLISHER SAYS SALE OF WORCESTER TELEGRAM IMMINENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sale of the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette, the third largest
daily newspaper in Massachusetts, could be announced as soon as
next week, its publisher said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Telegram &AMP; Gazette publisher Bruce S. Bennett said indications
are there are three finalists for purchasing the paper, whose
history stretches back 115 years. They are the Journal Register
Co., of Trenton, N.J., Media News Group Inc. of Denver, and the New
York Times Co., which owns The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has told me it is these three, but that is what the
indications are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett would not say which company is to be the buyer of the
newspaper, but Newspaper Guild officials have said staffers expect
the Times Company to be the winning bidder. The purchase price is
expected to be between $200 million and $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Guild is preparing for a sale to the New York Times,''
said Kathleen Shaw, chairwoman of the Worcester unit of the
Providence Newspaper Guild. In September, the Worcester Telegram &AMP;
Gazette reported that seven potential buyers _ the three finalists
as well as Fidelity Investments' Community Newspaper Co. of
Needham, Mass.; Pulitzer Inc. of St. Louis, Gannett Co. Inc., of
Arlington, Va., and Copley Press Inc. of La Jolla, Calif. _ toured
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two or three weeks ago, architects representing the New
York Times Co. visited the building, taking photographs, in a
precursor to a possible building renovation, said Shaw, leading to
speculation among staffers that the Times was to be the paper's
next owner.
</P>
<P>
   Times Co. spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen declined to comment, saying
the company has a long-standing policy of not discussing potential
acquisitions, divestures or investments.
</P>
<P>
   One reason to believe a sale of the T&AMP;G is imminent is Tuesday's
announcement by Pulitzer Inc. that it was purchasing The
Pantagraph, the T&AMP;G's sister paper in Bloomington, Ill., for $180
million from the Chronicle Publishing Co. of San Francisco, which
owns the Worcester paper, and put them both up for sale, along with
the San Francisco Chronicle, three television stations, two book
publishing companies, a Web site and a cable news outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that with the pace of the situation, something
will happen within next seven days,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Worcester is New England's second largest city with a population
of 162,000. The Telegram &AMP; Gazette has a daily circulation of
107,405 and 134,067 on Sunday.

NEW MEXICO BOARD OF EDUCATION RULES OUT TEACHING CREATIONISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story was budgeted earlier as NEW-MEXICO-SCHOOLS) 
(th) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Bucking recent changes in Kansas and other
states that allow public schools to teach alternative views of
human development, the New Mexico Board of Education voted
overwhelmingly on Friday to limit the statewide science curriculum
to the teaching of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The vote effectively made New Mexico the first state in recent
years to take a firm stand against the teaching of creationism,
which generally recognizes the Bible as the ultimate authority on
how the world was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other
species a mere 10,000 years ago, while evolutionists say scientific
evidence shows that life began almost 4 billion years ago with
simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, teachers had been required to give equal weight to
alternative theories _ which in practical terms meant creationism _
in their science classroom discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives teachers the political cover they need to teach
evolution,'' said Marshall Berman, the board member who led a
three-year campaign to change the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The board voted 14-1 in favor of the change, which will affect
the 100,000 children who attend New Mexico's 725 public schools.
The lone dissenter, Van W. Witt, objected by arguing that students
should be allowed to consider all sides of the debate and then
``make up their minds with their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief debate among board members that preceded the vote,
Berman refuted that position, insisting that creationism _ or
``intelligent design,'' as some evolution opponents call it _ is
not a comparable theory for teaching in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the assumption is there are two sides, I question the
assumption,'' Berman told Witt. ``The sense is of creationism as a
scientific theory, that it exists as a reliable principle. But it
is not based on science.''
</P>
<P>
   While the often emotional debate between proponents of
creationism and evolution is not new, it was rekindled this summer
when the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete almost any
mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar action, the Education Department of Kentucky
deleted the word ``evolution'' from the state science curriculum,
replacing it with the phrase ``change over time,'' which some state
teachers interpreted as an attack on widely-accepted scientific
principles.
</P>
<P>
   Other states, including Alabama and Nebraska, have made other
changes that allow for discussion of theories that challenge
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Creationists hailed each of those changes as major victories
during a time when the teaching of evolution has enjoyed
pre-eminence in most public school districts as a result of a 1987
Supreme Court decision that said states could not compel the
teaching of creationism in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In their battles to chip away at the dominance of evolution as
the unchallenged explanation of life, creationists have run
headstrong into teachers and scientists who have effectively
lobbied their state and local school boards, as they have here in
New Mexico, to keep evolution at the forefront of classroom
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Flora M. Sanchez, the president of the New Mexico Board, said
that since the Kansas decision she had received ``a lot of negative
input'' from scientists and teachers around the state who were
uncomfortable with performance standards that required teachers to
entertain alternative theories to evolution. Many of the board
members felt uneasy with comparisons with Kansas, she said, adding,
``So we decided we had to clarify our standards.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of that pressure was evident Friday, during the public
comment period that preceded the vote. Eight proponents of the
changes, most of them scientists and teachers, urged the board to
vote in favor, while three people appeared to raise objections.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Miller, a high school biology teacher who testified before
the board, said that he feels more comfortable with a regulation
that narrows teaching to theories based on science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need it spelled out that I don't have to address a string of
silly alternative theories,'' he said. ``With 175 class room days,
I don't have time for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another proponent of the change, David E. Thomas, editor of the
Newsletter of the New Mexicans for Science and Reason, said that if
public schools allowed unscientific theories to be taught, ``pretty
soon we'll have Holocaust deniers insisting there were no gas
chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Chapman, who teaches first- and second-graders, said the
new regulations would even help teachers of the youngest children
in public schools whose early knowledge of human development is
often shaped by religion and is learned at home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was recently approached by a little boy in class
who told her why dinosaurs no longer roam the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Because there was no room in the ark,''' Ms. Chapman
said. ``I don't think he made that up himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those protesting the new standards was Paul Gammill, a
retired engineer and the father of three children who attended
Albuquerque public schools. He echoed the concerns of many
creationists, telling the board that evolution is ``arbitrary and
dogmatic.'' He insisted that his view has nothing to do with
religion, but in an interview before his testimony he said a belief
in God is not compatible with acceptance of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   While it appeared that most board members had their minds made
up before the vote, they listened with rapt attention to Tom
Manaster, a retired cab driver from Chicago now living in New
Mexico who urged the board to reject any teaching standards beyond
what can be proven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be here if it weren't for good science,'' he said.
``Five years ago I survived a brain tumor. Those doctors had all
kinds of religions and beliefs, but they also had some pretty good
science.''

A GLOOMY VIEW OF IMMIGRATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Mississippi to Minnesota these days, there's hardly a
heartland city without a Peruvian restaurant, West African
hair-braiding place or Korean green grocer. Asians are now the
country's fastest-growing ethnic minority group. Hispanic people
will soon be the biggest one, outnumbering African-Americans by a
wide margin. Nearly one in five children born today has at least
one foreign-born parent.
</P>
<P>
   America's ``second great migration'' has prompted as much
controversy as the first, which brought millions of Europeans to
Ellis Island. Are immigrants one reason that America's economy has
been the world's most vibrant for nearly two decades? Or are they
to blame for the stagnant wages of America's unskilled workers and
the growing gap between haves and have-nots? Are the newcomers
models of hard work, thrift and old-fashioned family values, or
deadbeats who evade taxes and collect welfare? Will their children
and grandchildren join the economic mainstream or wind up in the
underclass?
</P>
<P>
   There are no cut and dried answers. But for an impressively
researched, brightly written and tightly argued polemic against
America's current liberal immigration policy, look at ``Heaven's
Door: Immigration Policy and the American Economy'' (Princeton
University Press, 1999) by George J. Borjas, one the nation's
leading _ and certainly gloomiest _ experts on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas himself is a shining example of the classic immigrant
rags to riches story. A refugee from Cuba who grew up in a Miami
ghetto, he wound up with an Ivy League education and today holds a
Harvard professorship. But in ``Heaven's Door,'' Borjas calls for
sharply restricting the number of future immigrants, especially
those who, as his own family was in the early '60s, are poor,
unskilled and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family would never have been able to pass the test that I
think would best serve the interests of the United States,'' he
writes. ``There were no college graduates in my family, no wealth
to prove that we would not become public charges, no particular
skills that would seem urgently needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the '60s, as Borjas tells it, family ties rather than
education, skills or national origin have determined which
foreigners get to pursue the American dream. As a result,
two-thirds of the recent arrivals have come from Latin America and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Four out of 10 wind up in the bottom one-fifth of the income
distribution. And, by the late 1990s, the average new arrival had
two fewer years of schooling than the average native-born American.
In contrast, 30 years ago, most immigrants came from Europe, and
the average newcomer was ahead in education.
</P>
<P>
   Borjas acknowledges that, despite a ``precipitous decline'' in
average skills, immigration is keeping an aging work force younger
than it would otherwise be, and has, on the whole, been good for
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unskilled immigrants provide employers with bargain-priced labor
and provide middle-class consumers with bargain-priced services
from baby-sitting to nursing-home care.
</P>
<P>
   But, reflecting a growing unease among economists over
inequality, he argues that while immigration has increased the
total economic pie modestly, the far more significant effect has
been to depress opportunity and pay for the most disadvantaged
native-born workers, especially African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central issue in the debate therefore,'' he says, ``is not
whether immigration increases the size of the economic pie; it is
about how the pie is split.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But immigration has not been a major reason that wages
at the bottom have stagnated for more than two decades. Rather, the
computer age has rewarded the college-educated and punished high
school dropouts. Further, Borjas is overly jaundiced in his views.
He scarcely acknowledges that unemployment is at a 30-year low,
that poverty is at an all-time low while typical family income is
at a record, or that bottom-rung wages have lately been rising
briskly.
</P>
<P>
   True, the pay of low-wage native workers would no doubt have
risen even sooner and faster absent immigration, but the extra
supply of willing labor has also helped keep inflation at bay and
therefore allowed the economic expansion to keep rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Borjas argues that the sheer number and concentration
of immigrants are creating the same ghetto effect that has
marginalized inner-city blacks. But immigrants have lately been
fanning out all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The education gap is real, and Borjas is probably right in
concluding that it will take several generations to erase. But he
plays down some of recent immigrants' strengths _ strong family
ties and a super work ethic _ that augur well for upward mobility.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics have employment rates nearly as high as whites, and,
as a 1998 study showed, second-generation children have higher
grades and lower dropout rates than other American children.
</P>
<P>
   Few people, even the most ardent free marketeers, would argue
that America should open its doors to every Third World citizen who
wants to emigrate. Immigration confers permanent and scarce
political and economic rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the case for cutting immigration in half and largely
limiting it, as some countries do, to the well heeled and well
educated is not nearly so economically _ much less morally or
politically _ compelling as Borjas would have you believe.

GENENTECH ANNOUNCES STOCK SPLIT AND PUBLIC OFFERING BY PARENT
COMPANY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Switzerland)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Genentech Inc. said Friday that Roche Holdings
Inc., its parent company, intends to sell 20 million shares of
Genentech common stock as soon as possible, reducing its ownership
of Genentech to 65 percent from 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech also announced a 2-for-1 stock split at a date yet to
be determined. The split and the public offering by Roche both
reflect the substantial gains in Genentech shares. Since they were
first offered to the public in July at $97, Genentech shares have
traded as high as $179.50. In June, Roche exercised its option to
buy the 33 percent of Genentech it did not already own for $82.50 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale will be for the sole benefit of Roche,
which is based in Basel, Switzerland. Roche also intends to issue
dollar-denominated bonds exchangeable with Roche for up to
approximately 5.5 million shares of Genentech common stock owned by
Roche. Genentech, based in South San Francisco, will not receive
any proceeds from the transaction, but Genentech executives said
their shareholders will benefit from increased liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some frustration on the part of investors, that
with the low trading volume, it can be difficult to get in and out
of the stock without moving the market,'' said Arthur D. Levinson,
Genentech's chairman and chief executive. He said the offering,
coupled with the split, would quadruple the number of shares
available for trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a softer realm, this sale of the shares is in part a
reflection of Roche's confidence that we're doing a good job
managing the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech shares closed Friday at $157.75, down $15.0625, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said that Genentech has benefited
both from its own strong execution and from the general run-up in
the shares of the larger biotechnology companies this year, and
that Friday's stock movement represented profit taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brilliant,'' said Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta
Partners. ``Even Roche could not have anticipated it would go so
well.'' Although Genentech's financial results have been positive,
the share price represents the anticipation of even stronger future
growth, he said. ``Investors are not so much focused on the current
earnings, but on the potential of Genentech to surprise us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Genentech Friday also reported earnings that
exceeded Wall Street estimates. For the third quarter, exclusive of
special and recurring redemption related charges, Genentech earned
$66.9 million, or 51 cents a diluted share, topping the 39 cents a
share expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Including the charges, Genentech reported a loss of $62.8
million, which compared with earnings of $63.4 million, or 49 cents
a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue grew by 10 percent to
$345.3 million from $313.9 million in the same quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech attributed the revenue growth primarily to sales of
Herceptin, a treatment for some cases of metastatic breast cancer,
and Rituxan, a treatment for some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

NATIONAL WESTMINSTER SHAKE-UP FOLLOWS TAKEOVER BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Desperate to thwart a $34 billion hostile takeover by
the Bank of Scotland, National Westminster PLC dismissed its
discredited chief executive on Friday and hired an outside salvage
expert.
</P>
<P>
   Sir David Rowland, Natwest's chairman, will replace the chief
executive, Derek Wanless, and Ron Sandler, the former chief
executive of Lloyds of London, will join the bank as chief
operating officer. Sir David and Sandler had worked at Lloyds
together and are credited with rescuing its insurance business from
near-ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The management shake-up was the first aggressive move by
Natwest, the No.3 bank in Britain, as it tries to repel the
takeover attempt announced by the Bank of Scotland two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The move did not come as a surprise to most analysts, who said
the departure of Wanless was needed to regain the confidence of
investors unhappy with his management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it was inevitable that they had to get rid of
Derek,'' said Robin Down, a banking analyst at ABN Amro in London.
``He had no credibility with the investment community over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanless lost the support of investors after a string of bungled
deals including an attempt to create a leading investment banking
unit and, most recently, a failed $17.2 billion bid for Legal and
General Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors had opposed that deal, saying Natwest was
offering too much money for the company, a British insurer.
Natwest's stock price fell as a result, and that was considered one
reason the Bank of Scotland was emboldened to make a bid on Sept.
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you preside over a couple of disasters, people lose
faith,'' Down said of Wanless. ``The final straw came with the
Legal and General deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Natwest said Wanless would remain a consultant to the bank. But
it was apparent that his dismissal occurred amid tension with Sir
David, who said Natwest made the management changes because ``what
we wanted was people who eat red meat for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir David made the remark in an interview with Bloomberg News,
and the statement was later confirmed by a Natwest spokesman. Sir
David and Wanless declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Natwest is also said to be considering a plan to sell 5 billion
pounds ($8.3 billion) in assets to strengthen investor confidence
even further. Executives close to the company said the bank was
considering a plan to sell its fund-management unit, Gartmore
Investment Management; its bond-trading operation, Greenwich
Natwest; and Ulster Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really digging in their heels for a fight,'' said Tom
Rayner, a banking analyst at SG Securities in London.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Natwest's new management could also help in an
effort to find a friendly buyer to help it escape the Bank of
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier for a potential white knight to come in if
they keep the chief executive slot open,'' Down said. ``They are
looking for a rescue team.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Natwest are still trading over the Bank of Scotland's
original bid, partly in anticipation that another suitor may soon
emerge. The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Abbey National PLC are
said to be considering bids.
</P>
<P>
   Any possible bidder will probably wait for the Bank of Scotland
to issue its official offer document, expected as soon as early
next week. On Thursday, the Bank of Scotland said the acquisition,
if completed, would create 1 billion pounds, or nearly $1.7
billion, in savings per year through cost-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burt, chief executive of the Bank of Scotland, said he
believed his bank could squeeze more savings out of Natwest than
any possible counterbidders.
</P>
<P>
   Natwest's anti-takeover moves on Friday did little to convince
investors one way or the other. Shares of Natwest increased 2
pence, to 1,442 pence ($23.94) while shares of the Bank of Scotland
dropped 4.5 pence, to 725 pence ($12.03).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think getting rid of Wanless will make much of a
difference to the overall outcome of the takeover battle,'' Rayner
said. ``It's not much a defense.''

AGENCY TO STUDY WHETHER NAVY BOMBING CAUSES CANCER ON VIEQUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's key disease-monitoring agency
agreed Friday to investigate claims by residents of the Puerto
Rican island of Vieques that nearly six decades of Navy and Marine
Corps bombing practice caused a high rate of cancer there.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the Atlanta-based Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) threatens to complicate President
Clinton's already delayed decision on Navy requests to resume
live-fire combat training at the Atlantic Fleet's 58-year-old
target-practice range.
</P>
<P>
   The range has been closed since April 19 when a Marine pilot
mistakenly dropped two 500 pounds bombs on a range observation post
more than a mile from his intended target, killing a Puerto Rican
security guard and injuring four other civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The accident sparked demands by Puerto Rico's political leaders
and allies in Congress for the Navy to permanently end the bombing
and withdraw from the picturesque island that is home to almost
9,400 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Williams, the assistant surgeon general and director
of the ATSDR's division of health assessment and consultation,
notified Gordon Rumore, a resident of Vieques, of the agency's
decision in a letter mailed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore, a retired Pennsylvania state environmental health
specialist and a public health nurse who settled on Vieques in
1998, petitioned the ATSDR on May 14 to make ``an investigation and
assessment of a clear, immediate and profound risk to the health''
of island residents from toxic chemicals in bombs, rockets and
naval gunfire rained down on the 899-acre site since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore claimed that the thousands of tons of explosives
detonated in that period created clouds of toxic dust that were
carried by trade winds over populated areas 10 miles away and that
contaminated the residents.
</P>
<P>
   Williams wrote Rumore Friday that his request ``for a public
health assessment of the population subjected to toxic chemicals
from the detonation, deflagration and decomposition of military
ordnance ... meets the ATSDR criteria for conducting'' the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The health monitoring agency has started to gather ``relevant
environmental sampling data and exposure information'' from federal
and local authorities and has formed a site team to evaluate the
data, Williams added.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Skipper, spokeswoman for the ATSDR, an arm of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said the
investigation could ``take a year or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency launched the probe, Skipper said, because ``there are
enough issues of public health significance.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Vieques have complained about the incidence of
cancer there for years. A study of health statistics during the
1980s by Dr. Diego E. Zavala, director of the Central Cancer
Registry of Puerto Rico, concluded in October 1997 that the number
of cancer cases per capita on Vieques during the five-year period
ending in 1989 was 26.9 percent higher than in any other Puerto
Rican community.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore, who had worked with the ATSDR on hazardous sites during
his 12 years with the government of Pennsylvania, said he welcomed
the agency's decision.
</P>
<P>
   He charged that the Navy had ``shown a depraved indifference to
human health'' by failing to ``monitor the health of the people of
Vieques through epidemiological surveys, water sampling and air
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy Cdr. Karen Jeffries, a Navy spokeswoman at the Pentagon,
said the Navy and Marine Corps welcome the ATSDR study because it
will settle the question of whether Vieques' high cancer rate stems
from live-fire training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these operations were proven to be harmful or cause cancer,
we would cease and desist,'' Jeffries said, adding: ``But there are
currently no studies anywhere that suggest our military operations
are harmful to the residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffries reiterated the Navy's contention that it needs to
resume the live-fire training on Vieques immediately to prepare
Atlantic-based Navy and Marine forces for possible combat before
deploying on routine missions to the Mediterranean and Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a deputy White House press secretary and spokesman
for the White House National Security Council, said Clinton will
consider the ATSDR decision to investigate the cancer charges as he
ponders the future of the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   A four-member Pentagon review panel appointed in June at the
president's request had been expected to make recommendations on
the range by Aug. 31 to Defense Secretary William Cohen. But the
panel didn't issue its initial report until Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   At that time it recommended that live-fire training should be
resumed on a limited basis for the next five years and that the
Navy should withdraw from the island by 2005. The panel also
recommended an immediate and comprehensive study of the incidence
of cancer on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen then asked the panel to rework its recommendations. Leavy
said Friday that ``the recommendations are still being worked
out.'' He added that Clinton ``understands the passions and
emotions on both sides of this controversy.''

ENGLISH MAGISTRATE SAYS PINOCHET CAN BE EXTRADITED TO SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A London court ruled Friday that Gen. Augusto Pinochet
of Chile can be extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture and
conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chief magistrate of the Bow Street Magistrates Court,
Ronald Bartle, said that ``all the conditions are in place'' for
the transfer of the former Chilean dictator from London to Madrid
to face one charge of conspiracy to torture and 34 charges of the
torture of individual Chileans.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a number of dramatic court decisions since
Pinochet's arrest a year ago, Friday's was the first to be based on
the crimes he is accused of rather than simply on the legality of
his arrest. Pinochet was excused from appearing in the packed
chamber because of his failing health. But in a defiant statement
read by Clive Nicholls, his chief lawyer, he protested his
innocence and said he was the victim of a political conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers have 15 days to decide whether to appeal to the High
Court, and in the likely event that they do so, the case could
continue on through many more months of legal maneuvering and end
up returning to England's highest tribunal, the Law Lords of the
House of Lords, where it has already been through two extended
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all the appeals have been exhausted, Home Secretary
Jack Straw must make a final decision on whether Pinochet, 83,
should be sent to Spain. That decision, too, is subject to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers declined to say what their next course of
action would be, but Fernando Barros, a Chilean professor who leads
the general's support group in London, said there would be an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In getting Pinochet excused from court Friday, his British
doctor testified Wednesday that he had suffered two small strokes
in September and that he was disoriented and ``giddy'' much of the
time. The state of his health is not an issue during the appeal
process, but it will be a critically germane one if and when the
time comes to determine his fitness to go to Spain and stand trial.
One option open to Straw would be freeing Pinochet on compassionate
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bartle on Friday stressed that his ruling and the four days of
hearings held in the court in September were focused not on guilt
or innocence but only on whether the extradition papers were in
order and the charges were extraditable offenses under British law.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be too strongly emphasized that these proceedings
are not conducted for the purpose of deciding the guilt or
innocence of Senator Pinochet in respect of the allegations made
against him,'' he said in his decision. `` Nor would a finding on
my part, that the request of Spain should be complied with, be any
indication whatever that I have formed a view as to his guilt or
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, who gave himself the title of senator for life in an
effort to grant himself immunity from prosecution, said in a
statement: ``I declare that I am not guilty of the crimes of which
I am accused.'' He continued: ``Spain has not produced a single
piece of evidence which shows that I am guilty. Not only that, I
believe that Spain has not properly investigated any of the these
crimes and Spain does not even have jurisdiction to try me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said Spain was acting ``in violation of the sovereignty of
Chile'' and that ``It has long been clear that my extradition is
politically motivated and is being pursued clearly for political
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Alun Jones, the British lawyer representing the Spanish
government, said he had nothing to say in response to the Pinochet
claims, telling the court that there were already enough ``strident
voices'' surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a rally in Pinochet's behalf at the Conservative Party
conference in Blackpool on Wednesday night, former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher argued that he had been the victim of a
``judicial kidnap'' in circumstances ``which would do credit to a
police state.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Pinochet supporter, the former Conservative Chancellor
of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, argued that the British
government's longtime contention that the arrest and detention of
Pinochet was a judicial and not a political matter had been
undermined by a comment by Prime Minister Tony Blair in which he
called the former Chilean dictator ``unspeakable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Labor party convention in Bournemouth 11
days ago excoriating the opposition Conservatives as being out of
touch, Blair called them ``the party of fox-hunting, Pinochet and
hereditary peers _ the uneatable, the unspeakable and the
unelectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the point Friday, Barros said Blair's scornful comment
had been an unacceptable intervention in the case. ``That makes
this null and void,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's judgment, Bartle turned aside defense lawyers'
objections to the submission of the 35 cases outlined by Baltasar
Garzon, the Spanish judge who assembled the case against Pinochet.
The original charges against Pinochet at the time of his arrest in
London last Oct. 16 included allegations of kidnapping, murder and
genocide in the disappearances of more than 3,000 people dating to
1973, the year Pinochet seized power in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the Law Lords in March drastically reduced the
number of cases and limited the relevant period to after December
1988, the date when Britain adopted the international torture
convention making torture abroad a crime punishable in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that only two of the original charges, the conspiracy
count and a single torture allegation, survived from the original
extradition request. Over the summer Garzon added 33 new cases to
the application, and in Friday's ruling Bartle approved their
inclusion. ``The further material, objected to by the defense, is
in my view supplementary to and in amplification of the conduct
alleged against Senator Pinochet, namely his involvement in acts of
torture and conspiracy to commit such acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also appeared to give prosecutors some leeway to
get around that strict date. They would be able to cite
disappearances of people in the 1970s on the basis that these acts
were undertaken to commit ``mental torture'' on relatives and
survivors that continued into the period after 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not this was intended by the regime of Senator
Pinochet is in my view a matter of fact for the trial court,''
Bartle said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also gained the right to introduce evidence of
events before the crucial date as part of their effort to prove
that Pinochet was guilty of a long-running conspiracy to torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magistrate's ruling will allow the Spanish prosecutors to
show that Pinochet created a repressive state apparatus that relied
on torture, that he was fully aware that torture was being
practiced systematically and that he never once punished anyone who
committed torture,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human
Rights Watch in New York, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been living in a London suburb under police guard
since leaving a hospital in December where he was recuperating from
back surgery. He was arrested at the request of Garzon, who made
his case in the course of studying atrocities committed during the
so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The case has wound its way through English courts and already
secured a valuable legal victory for the human rights movement _
the finding that former heads of state do not enjoy immunity from
arrest and prosecution for crimes against humanity.

   TUCSON, Ariz. _ ``Calm down,'' Alex, an African Gray parrot,
told Dr. Irene Pepperberg, the scientist at the University of
Arizona who owns him. ``Don't tell me to calm down,'' Dr.
Pepperberg snapped. Sometimes Dr. Pepperberg and Alex squabble like
an old married couple. He even says, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 22 years, Dr. Pepperberg has been teaching Alex,
who is 23, to do complex tasks of the sort that only a few nonhuman
species _ chimpanzees, for example _ have been able to perform. But
unlike those other creatures, Alex can talk, or at least, he can
vocalize. And, Dr. Pepperberg says, Alex doesn't just imitate human
speech, as other parrots do _ Alex can think. His actions are not
just an instinctive response, she says, but rather a result of
reasoning and choice.
</P>
<P>
   Assertions like Dr. Pepperberg's are at the center of a highly
emotional debate about whether thought is solely the domain of
humans, or whether it can exist in other animals. Although many
people are intrigued by the idea that animals may be capable of
some form of abstract reasoning and communication, scientists often
ascribe what looks like clever behavior to mimicry or rote learning
or even, in some cases, unconscious clues by a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, just how smart is Alex?
</P>
<P>
   The question of animal intelligence goes back at least to
Descartes and his famous aphorism, ``I think, therefore I am.''
Animals cannot think, said Descartes, and therefore are inferior to
humans. And for many theologians and philosophers, the ability to
think gives man a unique closeness to God.
</P>
<P>
   Parrots, of course, are famous mimics, and some parrots have
bigger vocabularies than Alex. But no parrot, says Dr. Pepperberg,
has been able to perform tasks as complex as Alex can. And she
believes that when Alex vocalizes, he is expressing the results of
his thoughts, not mere mimicry. For example, when she asks Alex
what color corn is, he answers yellow, even though there is no corn
around. This means, she says, he has an abstract concept of what
the words ``color'' ``corn'' and ''yellow'' mean. He has not simply
memorized them, but can apply them to different objects.
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees and dolphins have been able to perform equally
complex tasks, though the tasks differ from those given to Alex
because the species are different. But chimps and dolphins,
obviously, cannot vocalize in the way Alex does. Alex, Dr.
Pepperberg believes, has the intellectual capacity of a 5-year-old
child while performing some tasks, but the emotional age of a 2
1/2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists would dispute that Alex is doing something
unusual in the history of animal studies. At the very least, his
behavior is more advanced than that of most other parrots who have
been the subject of scientific experiments. But scientists differ
on the implications of Alex's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Dr. Pepperberg has published her work in scientific
journals, but in January Harvard University Press will publish
``The Alex Studies,'' a summary of her experiments with Alex over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg purchased Alex at a garden-variety pet store in
Chicago when he was about a year old, young enough for her to
observe him as he grew up. As far as she knew, he had no particular
pedigree, and she is not even sure whether he is particularly smart
in relation to other parrots. Now she is trying to replicate his
training with another gray parrot in her lab, Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg, listing Alex's accomplishments, said that he
could identify 50 different objects and recognize quantities up to
six; that he could distinguish seven colors, five shapes and
understand ``bigger,'' ``smaller,'' ``same'' and ``different,'' and
that he was learning the concepts of ``over'' and ``under.'' Hold a
tray of different shapes and colored objects in front of him, as
Dr. Pepperberg was doing the other day, and he can distinguish an
object by its color, shape and the material it is made of. (Dr.
Pepperberg said that she frequently changed objects to make sure
Alex wasn't just memorizing things and that she also structured
experiments to avoid involuntary cues from his examiner).
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, Alex was being recalcitrant. Dr. Pepperberg had
been away for three weeks at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where she is a visiting professor this year. When she
leaves him, she says, Alex chews at his tail and wing feathers,
giving him a rather threadbare appearance, and when she returns he
is very demanding, turning his back as if to say, ``Come here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What matter is orange and three-cornered?'' she asked Alex,
holding the tray of objects in front of him. First, Alex had to
identify which object was orange and three-cornered, and then he
had to tell Dr. Pepperberg what it was made of. She allowed Alex to
pick up the objects on the tray with his beak and to ``examine''
each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a nut,'' Alex said clearly, sounding almost human for a
moment. (He also responds to the commands of people other than Dr.
Pepperberg, for instance, her graduate students.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I'll give you a nut,'' Dr. Pepperberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanna go back,'' said Alex, meaning he wanted to go back in
his cage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg continued trying to get Alex to perform, but he
resisted and she began to lose patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Alex,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said. Usually, said Dr. Pepperberg, that means
he is about to give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matter, Alex?'' she insisted, meaning what is it made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wool!'' said Alex, getting it right.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg refuses to call Alex's vocalizations
``language.'' ``I avoid the language issue,'' she said. ``I'm not
making claims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His behavior gets more and more advanced, but I don't believe
years from now you could interview him,'' she continued. ``What
little syntax he has is very simplistic. Language is an incredibly
complex form of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, many scientists and others remain unconvinced. What about
unconscious cues from the trainer? Perhaps the most famous instance
of that is Clever Hans, a horse at the turn of the century who
could supposedly count, tell time and make change by tapping his
hoof on the ground. It was discovered that Hans' trainer was
tipping him off to the right answer by tensing his body and moving
his head as Hans ``counted.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Dr.Herbert Terrace, a Columbia University
professor of psychology, famously repudiated his own experiments in
the 1970s with a chimpanzee he called Nim Chimpsky, after his
mentor, the MIT linguist Noam Chomsky. Terrace taught Nim to use
signs that looked as if they were combined grammatically into
sentences. But it turned out they were very clever imitations of
his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Alex, Terrace said he thought that what Alex was
doing was ``a rote response.'' He calls it ``a complex
discriminative performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Alex thinking? ``I would say minimally,'' Terrace
responded. ``In every situation, there is an external stimulus that
guides his response.'' Thought, he said, involves the ability to
process information that is not right in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows Alex is a smart bird,'' he said. But if you take away
the fact that Alex can vocalize in a way that seems human, he went
on, it would not seem as impressive: ``The words are responses, not
language.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the animal-intelligence debate is Dr.
Donald Griffin, author of ``Animal Thinking,'' who coined the
phrase ``cognitive ethology,'' the study of animal cognition. He
believes that animals are capable of complex thought and behavior
that is not just instinctive. The discovery ``that a bird can
express his conscious thoughts and feelings,'' said Griffin, ``is a
great advance. We did not used to think that was possible.'' To
Griffin, Alex's achievements are just one more proof of his
contention that animals are capable of highly complex thought.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's views of animal intelligence have been hotly
contested. ``The intensity of the aversion is incredible,'' he
said. ``It's a very touchy subject. Scientists don't like to be
told that a valid reason for what an animal does is the possibility
that he does it with any consciousness.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Pinker, an MIT scientist and author of `'How the Mind
Works,'' said that at the heart of the debate is the question of
human primacy. ``In earlier times the issue was of whether we are
mere animals, and to separate and exalt human worth. Ironically,
there has been the same kind of moralistic return from animal fans
who say we shouldn't mistreat them because they think and feel the
way we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinker believes that human beings alone are genetically
programmed to learn speech spontaneously and easily. ``We're
smarter in many ways,'' he said, ``but animals do some things
smarter. I think it is rather an ironic definition of animals to
tend to ennoble them by training them to mimic humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, birds have been thought of as on the low end of
the intelligence scale _ hence the term ``birdbrain.'' The point,
Dr. Pepperberg said, is that Alex ``is a nonmammal, nonprimate,
with a brain the size of a walnut.'' And Alex's accomplishments,
she added, show that ``animal intelligence is more widespread than
we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg attributes what she calls Alex's ability to
reason and process complex information to her training methods.
Most training of birds has followed the operant conditioning
theories of the late behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner. A bird
is taught to say or do a specific thing by a human instructor and
is rewarded with food. Dr. Pepperberg initially uses the object
itself as a reward _ a plastic square, for instance _ so that the
bird associates the word directly with the object. She also uses
two human trainers instead of one, and they demonstrate the
interaction she is trying to teach Alex.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Dr. Pepperberg stands in front of Alex with a
graduate student and orders the student to select a three-sided
orange object and to say what the object is made of _ wool,
perhaps. She believes that by watching the interaction, Alex
connects the graduate student's response to the command.
``Orange,'' she believes, comes to mean to Alex the color of an
object rather than the immediate reward of a grape.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg says her experiments have implications beyond
determining whether _ how well _ animals can think. She says her
methods have been successfully used to train autistic persons and
children with learning disabilities. Alex's achievements, she said,
also underscore the need for stricter conservation of parrots,
which are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg, who is 50, was born in New York City, an only
child who kept parakeets as pets and taught them to speak. She is
divorced and has no children. She was in the middle of studying for
her Ph.D. in chemistry at Harvard, she said, when she saw a
``Nova'' series on PBS about chimps using sign language, dolphin
research and the question of why birds sing. She wanted to change
fields, but her advisers discouraged her, she said, so she
continued her studies in chemistry, continuing nonetheless to read
everything she could on animal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When she applied for her first grant to study bird behavior from
the National Institutes of Health, she said, ``there were reviews
asking me what I was smoking,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not at all surprised a chimpanzee can do this,''
she went on.``You can't imagine _ people said birds were stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg expects Alex to live at least another 20 years.
Meanwhile, she has added two new birds to the lab. Besides Griffin,
now 4 years old, there is Kyaaro. She believes both exhibit
symptoms of attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex doesn't like either of them,'' she said. ``Kyaaro is
weird. Griffin is a threat.'' Right now she is trying to train
Griffin to do some of the things Alex can do.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who learned the word ``wool'' only recently, has been
clinging to it the way a child clings to a new-found possession.
One day recently Dr. Pepperberg held up a purple refrigerator
letter S and asked, ``What sound is purple?'' Griffin stared at the
letter. But from the other side of the laboratory Alex made the
sound for him, ``SSS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buttinsky,'' Dr. Pepperberg said to Alex and turned back to
Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sound?'' she asked Griffin again, holding up the S.
``What sound?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wool,'' said Griffin. He has a long way to go.

JOHN CLARK, 73; PSYCHIATRIST, AUTHORITY ON DANGER OF CULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John G. Clark of Weston, Mass., a psychiatrist who was among
the first to note the damaging affects of membership in cults, died
Thursday in Belmont Manor nursing home. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clark was a member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School
and the staff at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. He maintained a
private practice in Weston.
</P>
<P>
   After several families consulted him in the early '70s about
their children's membership in fringe religious groups, he became
convinced that the young people were the subjects of what he termed
``an impermissible experiment'' of subtle and sophisticated
psychological manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, his editorial on the subject in the Journal of the
American Medical Association led to wider discussion of the problem
and frequent appearances on TV shows, including a BBC documentary
about the Unification Church.
</P>
<P>
   His criticism of the Church of Scientology led to two lawsuits
being filed against him by the group. Though the suits were
eventually dismissed, Dr. Clark in 1985 filed suit in US District
Court against L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the church, alleging a
conspiracy to ``destroy'' him through a series of threats,
harassment, and false and malicious accusations seeking revocation
of his medical license and hospital privileges. That suit was
settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Dr. Clark received the Leo J. Ryan award, named
for the California congressman murdered in Jonestown, Guyana, and,
in 1991 The Psychiatric Times named his psychiatrist of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In nominating him, UCLA psychiatrist Dr. John Hochman described
Dr. Clark as ``a quiet, courageous man of conviction, who was
fighting an all-too-lonely and unappreciated battle against
well-financed, ruthless organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that ``early on, Dr. Clark concluded that the cult
issue was at heart a question of human rights. He called the cult
phenomenon an `impermissible experiment' since these groups were
gaining a level of exploitive control over their recruits that no
ethical social psychologist would ever attempt to gain over his
experimental subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hochman, ``a student present at a 1978 seminar on
cults recalled Dr. Clark stating that `it was only a matter of time
before there would be a bloodbath.' Some in the audience laughed
this off, but several months later, the mass suicide-homicides of
Jonestown occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Clark was born in St. Cloud, Minn. After serving in the
Navy, he graduated from Macalester College in St. Paul, and then
Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Eleanor (Sherwood); a daughter, Catherine; a
son, Gordon H.; two brothers, Robert S. and W. Bruce; and a
grandson.

IT'S ALL UP TO PEDRO'S BROTHER RAMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is fragile and well-rested. He is experienced and
poised. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs only 184 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He's not heavy. He's Pedro's Brother. And Ramon Martinez is all
that stands between the Red Sox and the winter of 1999-00.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro (back) is hurt, Nomar (wrist) is wounded, and after two
days of agony and annihilation, the Sons of Jimy Williams have come
home to die. But before they expire, there is at least one more
game to be played, one more loss to package and carry into the next
century with all the others. Big Brother Ramon, a man who has
pitched in exactly four major league games in the last 16 months,
gets the ball at Fenway Saturday at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Weird. After all that's happened, who would have guessed that
Ramon would be the healthy Martinez for this suddenly disappointing
playoff ride?
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the Red Sox didn't have this luxury back in 1967 when
they had to throw Cy Young Award winner Jim Lonborg on two rest for
the seventh game of the World Series. Alas, Eric Lonborg was never
a big league pitcher. And think about how cool it would have been
if Randy Clemens could have pitched Game 7 in '86, the day after
Cy-designee Roger left with a blister on his index finger. Imagine
if Oil Can Boyd had a brother (Chainsaw Boyd, perhaps) who could
have rescued the Sox every time the Can got hurt or lost his way?
</P>
<P>
   Pedro has a brother and he is more than capable of winning.
Thirty-one-year-old Ramon was in the majors long before Little
Pedro came along (the Dodgers signed Ramon when he was 16) and won
20 games for Los Angeles in 1990. He is a two-time All-Star, has
thrown a no-hitter, struck out 18 batters in a game, and pitched in
two postseason contests (0-1, 5.84 ERA). But it somehow seems
unfair that he should be the last line of defense for the 1999
Boston baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Indians) have a great lineup,'' acknowledged Ramon.
``What I've got to do is go out there and try to beat it. I'm going
to try to do that (today). I'm not 100 percent yet, but I'm getting
close. What I have now, I can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought he could throw more than 100 pitches, maybe
even toss a complete game. It seems too much to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, we were all assuming the Sox would win Game
1 behind Pedro and then try to steal one of the next three games
hurled by veterans Bret Saberhagen, Ramon, and Kent Mercker. That
was before Pedro got hurt and Saberhagen went wild and Thome
Thunder struck twice at the Jake.
</P>
<P>
   And now it is left to Ramon to prevent Boston's fourth playoff
sweep in five tries, AB (After Buckner). A loss would make Boston a
hideous 1-19 in postseason play since Game 5 of the 1986 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has pitched in the playoffs before,'' said Williams. ``He
has pitched well in his last couple starts. The big thing for me,
watching him pitch, is his foundation, his legs. He carried his
legs well beneath him those last two games, and I don't believe he
was tired coming out because of the conditioning he's been through.
I look forward to watching him pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon's shoulder was rebuilt in June 1998, and in the summer of
'99 he pitched in Lowell, Sarasota, and Pawtucket before returning
to the majors Sept. 2. He lasted only three innings in that first
start at Fenway and was dropped from the rotation, only to return
and win his final two starts _ lasting seven and six innings in
victories over the moribund Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon Martinez beat us the last time he pitched against us (he
actually pitched 4 2/3 innings in a 14-3 Sox win),'' said Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove. ``We know what we're in for. We know what
his pitches are. It's not that he's an unknown. We know we've got
to be very good to beat him. Last time we weren't very good, and he
beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my second outing,'' recalled Ramon. ``I was very
pleased with the way I pitched against the Indians. I was a little
wild (four walks). I'm going to try to do a little better than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they took me out of the rotation, I wasn't thinking I'd
make it to the playoffs. But they've given me an opportunity to
pitch and I've taken advantage, and I feel better and better every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro will be at Ramon's side in the dugout, going over the
Cleveland batters, and maybe talking about the hungry years in the
Dominican when they had no money for baseballs and learned to throw
curveballs using rolled-up balls of tape and the heads of their
sisters' dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he will give me any advice,'' said Ramon. ``He
might be a little nervous. We will probably talk a little bit about
some of the batters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to compare his personality with Pedro's, Ramon smiled and
said, ``We're a little different. I mean, he . . . that's all I'm
gonna say. We're a little different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is too skinny,'' said Pedro. ``My other brother, Jesus, is
too skinny. And my brother Nelson is too short. I am just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said he thought Pedro could pitch Game 5 Monday if the Sox
win the next two games. Too bad the Sox didn't win Game 1 and let
the Brothers Martinez take the whole series.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitching brother tandem in postseason history was St.
Louis's Dizzy and Paul Dean, who won all four games of the 1934
World Series against the Detroit Tigers. Theoretically, Ramon and
Pedro could set the standard this year.
</P>
<P>
   Or next.

CLEVELAND BATS LEAVE RED SOX UNFOCUSED 
</HEADLINE>

   They knew it before, but they know it even better now. They know
it in 0-2 reality. On the verge of being swept out of the American
League's Division Series, the Red Sox return for Game 3 at Fenway
knowing all too well the depth, talent, and persistent
determination of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're swinging the bats well,'' said Sox outfielder Darren
Lewis, following the 11-1 hammering the Indians put on the Sox
Thursday afternoon at Jacobs Field, lifting Cleveland's advantage
to 2-0 in the best-of-five series. ``You've got to give them
credit. Now we've got to get ourselves refocused.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have been seeking to regain their senses ever since
losing a 2-0 lead in Game 1, an advantage erased by a two-run Jim
Thome bomb over the right-field wall in the sixth inning. Three
innings later, Manny Ramirez scored the winning run, setting the
Sox up the next afternoon for their worst thrashing in postseason
history. The 10-run margin was even worse than the Sox' 12-3 loss
to the Cardinals in Game 4 of the '46 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Cleveland's combination of Bartolo Colon on the mound
and Thome's blast over the moon was too much. In Game 2, a rehabbed
Bret Saberhagen couldn't come close to matching Charles Nagy, and
the mighty Cleveland lineup amassed all 11 runs by trotting 17
hitters to the plate across the third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   The big hits were a three-run blast by Harold Baines in the
third and a grand slam by Thome (you were expecting maybe Travis
Fryman?) in the fourth. Adding to the feeding frenzy, Saberhagen
and reliever John Wasdin issued a charitable motherlode of six
walks in those two innings. The Indians beat them with their bats
and with their patience for good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of the year, you're facing good pitching,'' said
Lewis. ``(In Game 1) it was Colon, and then Nagy kept us off
balance. I think it's good for us to get home and have the
home-field advantage. No one at this point is done. Sure, we would
have liked to have done better, but at the same time, you've got to
give them credit.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Sox have struggled to cobble together a pitching
rotation beyond Pedro Martinez, the Indians have methodically
trotted their starters to the mound. While the Red Sox have sought
more pop than a Nomar Garciaparra-Mike Stanley combination (they
paired up for Boston's five hits in Game 1), the Indians have nine
reliable hitters, all of whom carry an air of offensive
assuredness.
</P>
<P>
   For two games, the Sox have appeared and played like so many
disassembled links in a chain, only to be lashed by the Indians'
bullwhip consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know you don't win any sort of race without having
all your components,'' said Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove.
``Whatever team is out there usually is noted for one or two strong
points, and even if all of their components are solid and strong,
there's a tendency for some to be overlooked. We scored over 1,000
runs this year in the regular season and, you know, everything has
a tendency to be overlooked, you know, beyond that. So we feel like
we've got good, solid starting pitching and we've got a good, solid
bullpen, and really that's the way it's gone for most of the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, this Indians team is a far more solid and consistent
bunch than many in Red Sox Nation believed this time a week ago.
Perhaps the Sox were better matched this time, especially in a
short series, but that perceived edge was built solely around Pedro
Martinez's right arm. He was penciled in for two wins (remember?),
but when those went up in the fire that burned in his back muscle
in Game 1, and all the smoke quickly cleared, the Indians were left
standing as the monolith too easily overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backs are against the wall,'' said third baseman John
Valentin, unduly scorched for a Game 1 error that set the stage for
Thome's destructive two-run homer. ``Nagy pitched well . . .
they've got a great lineup . . . Saberhagen was doing his best to
shut 'em down there . . . but the bottom line is, we have to score
some runs. We've got to be aggressive and take it to them the best
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear for the Sox is that even a familiar Fenway outburst
might not be enough against the balanced, confident Indians. It may
not be a classic power-hitting assemblage in the Cleveland dugout,
but 1,000 runs in six months, roughly six runs a game, speak for
power and consistency. Whatever the game, they stick around, and
usually win.
</P>
<P>
   Their diversity is a true quality, emphasized Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we catch the ball well, we run the bases well, and
we've got people who hit the ball out of the ballpark,'' he said.
``I think that it's as evenly divided as any club that we've had,
offensively and defensively.''

   TUCSON, Ariz. _ ``Calm down,'' Alex, an African Gray parrot,
told Dr. Irene Pepperberg, the scientist at the University of
Arizona who owns him. ``Don't tell me to calm down,'' Dr.
Pepperberg snapped. Sometimes Dr. Pepperberg and Alex squabble like
an old married couple. He even says, ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 22 years, Dr. Pepperberg has been teaching Alex,
who is 23, to do complex tasks of the sort that only a few nonhuman
species _ chimpanzees, for example _ have been able to perform. But
unlike those other creatures, Alex can talk, or at least, he can
vocalize. And, Dr. Pepperberg says, Alex doesn't just imitate human
speech, as other parrots do _ Alex can think. His actions are not
just an instinctive response, she says, but rather a result of
reasoning and choice.
</P>
<P>
   Assertions like Dr. Pepperberg's are at the center of a highly
emotional debate about whether thought is solely the domain of
humans, or whether it can exist in other animals. Although many
people are intrigued by the idea that animals may be capable of
some form of abstract reasoning and communication, scientists often
ascribe what looks like clever behavior to mimicry or rote learning
or even, in some cases, unconscious clues by a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, just how smart is Alex?
</P>
<P>
   The question of animal intelligence goes back at least to
Descartes and his famous aphorism, ``I think, therefore I am.''
Animals cannot think, said Descartes, and therefore are inferior to
humans. And for many theologians and philosophers, the ability to
think gives man a unique closeness to God.
</P>
<P>
   Parrots, of course, are famous mimics, and some parrots have
bigger vocabularies than Alex. But no parrot, says Dr. Pepperberg,
has been able to perform tasks as complex as Alex can. And she
believes that when Alex vocalizes, he is expressing the results of
his thoughts, not mere mimicry. For example, when she asks Alex
what color corn is, he answers yellow, even though there is no corn
around. This means, she says, he has an abstract concept of what
the words ``color'' ``corn'' and ''yellow'' mean. He has not simply
memorized them, but can apply them to different objects.
</P>
<P>
   Chimpanzees and dolphins have been able to perform equally
complex tasks, though the tasks differ from those given to Alex
because the species are different. But chimps and dolphins,
obviously, cannot vocalize in the way Alex does. Alex, Dr.
Pepperberg believes, has the intellectual capacity of a 5-year-old
child while performing some tasks, but the emotional age of a 2
1/2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists would dispute that Alex is doing something
unusual in the history of animal studies. At the very least, his
behavior is more advanced than that of most other parrots who have
been the subject of scientific experiments. But scientists differ
on the implications of Alex's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Dr. Pepperberg has published her work in scientific
journals, but in January Harvard University Press will publish
``The Alex Studies,'' a summary of her experiments with Alex over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg purchased Alex at a garden-variety pet store in
Chicago when he was about a year old, young enough for her to
observe him as he grew up. As far as she knew, he had no particular
pedigree, and she is not even sure whether he is particularly smart
in relation to other parrots. Now she is trying to replicate his
training with another gray parrot in her lab, Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg, listing Alex's accomplishments, said that he
could identify 50 different objects and recognize quantities up to
six; that he could distinguish seven colors, five shapes and
understand ``bigger,'' ``smaller,'' ``same'' and ``different,'' and
that he was learning the concepts of ``over'' and ``under.'' Hold a
tray of different shapes and colored objects in front of him, as
Dr. Pepperberg was doing the other day, and he can distinguish an
object by its color, shape and the material it is made of. (Dr.
Pepperberg said that she frequently changed objects to make sure
Alex wasn't just memorizing things and that she also structured
experiments to avoid involuntary cues from his examiner).
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, Alex was being recalcitrant. Dr. Pepperberg had
been away for three weeks at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where she is a visiting professor this year. When she
leaves him, she says, Alex chews at his tail and wing feathers,
giving him a rather threadbare appearance, and when she returns he
is very demanding, turning his back as if to say, ``Come here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What matter is orange and three-cornered?'' she asked Alex,
holding the tray of objects in front of him. First, Alex had to
identify which object was orange and three-cornered, and then he
had to tell Dr. Pepperberg what it was made of. She allowed Alex to
pick up the objects on the tray with his beak and to ``examine''
each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want a nut,'' Alex said clearly, sounding almost human for a
moment. (He also responds to the commands of people other than Dr.
Pepperberg, for instance, her graduate students.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, I'll give you a nut,'' Dr. Pepperberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanna go back,'' said Alex, meaning he wanted to go back in
his cage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg continued trying to get Alex to perform, but he
resisted and she began to lose patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, Alex,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said. Usually, said Dr. Pepperberg, that means
he is about to give in.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matter, Alex?'' she insisted, meaning what is it made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wool!'' said Alex, getting it right.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg refuses to call Alex's vocalizations
``language.'' ``I avoid the language issue,'' she said. ``I'm not
making claims.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His behavior gets more and more advanced, but I don't believe
years from now you could interview him,'' she continued. ``What
little syntax he has is very simplistic. Language is an incredibly
complex form of communication.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, many scientists and others remain unconvinced. What about
unconscious cues from the trainer? Perhaps the most famous instance
of that is Clever Hans, a horse at the turn of the century who
could supposedly count, tell time and make change by tapping his
hoof on the ground. It was discovered that Hans' trainer was
tipping him off to the right answer by tensing his body and moving
his head as Hans ``counted.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Dr.Herbert Terrace, a Columbia University
professor of psychology, famously repudiated his own experiments in
the 1970s with a chimpanzee he called Nim Chimpsky, after his
mentor, the MIT linguist Noam Chomsky. Terrace taught Nim to use
signs that looked as if they were combined grammatically into
sentences. But it turned out they were very clever imitations of
his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Alex, Terrace said he thought that what Alex was
doing was ``a rote response.'' He calls it ``a complex
discriminative performance.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Alex thinking? ``I would say minimally,'' Terrace
responded. ``In every situation, there is an external stimulus that
guides his response.'' Thought, he said, involves the ability to
process information that is not right in front of you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows Alex is a smart bird,'' he said. But if you take away
the fact that Alex can vocalize in a way that seems human, he went
on, it would not seem as impressive: ``The words are responses, not
language.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the animal-intelligence debate is Dr.
Donald Griffin, author of ``Animal Thinking,'' who coined the
phrase ``cognitive ethology,'' the study of animal cognition. He
believes that animals are capable of complex thought and behavior
that is not just instinctive. The discovery ``that a bird can
express his conscious thoughts and feelings,'' said Griffin, ``is a
great advance. We did not used to think that was possible.'' To
Griffin, Alex's achievements are just one more proof of his
contention that animals are capable of highly complex thought.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin's views of animal intelligence have been hotly
contested. ``The intensity of the aversion is incredible,'' he
said. ``It's a very touchy subject. Scientists don't like to be
told that a valid reason for what an animal does is the possibility
that he does it with any consciousness.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Pinker, an MIT scientist and author of `'How the Mind
Works,'' said that at the heart of the debate is the question of
human primacy. ``In earlier times the issue was of whether we are
mere animals, and to separate and exalt human worth. Ironically,
there has been the same kind of moralistic return from animal fans
who say we shouldn't mistreat them because they think and feel the
way we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinker believes that human beings alone are genetically
programmed to learn speech spontaneously and easily. ``We're
smarter in many ways,'' he said, ``but animals do some things
smarter. I think it is rather an ironic definition of animals to
tend to ennoble them by training them to mimic humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, birds have been thought of as on the low end of
the intelligence scale _ hence the term ``birdbrain.'' The point,
Dr. Pepperberg said, is that Alex ``is a nonmammal, nonprimate,
with a brain the size of a walnut.'' And Alex's accomplishments,
she added, show that ``animal intelligence is more widespread than
we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg attributes what she calls Alex's ability to
reason and process complex information to her training methods.
Most training of birds has followed the operant conditioning
theories of the late behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner. A bird
is taught to say or do a specific thing by a human instructor and
is rewarded with food. Dr. Pepperberg initially uses the object
itself as a reward _ a plastic square, for instance _ so that the
bird associates the word directly with the object. She also uses
two human trainers instead of one, and they demonstrate the
interaction she is trying to teach Alex.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Dr. Pepperberg stands in front of Alex with a
graduate student and orders the student to select a three-sided
orange object and to say what the object is made of _ wool,
perhaps. She believes that by watching the interaction, Alex
connects the graduate student's response to the command.
``Orange,'' she believes, comes to mean to Alex the color of an
object rather than the immediate reward of a grape.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg says her experiments have implications beyond
determining whether _ how well _ animals can think. She says her
methods have been successfully used to train autistic persons and
children with learning disabilities. Alex's achievements, she said,
also underscore the need for stricter conservation of parrots,
which are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg, who is 50, was born in New York City, an only
child who kept parakeets as pets and taught them to speak. She is
divorced and has no children. She was in the middle of studying for
her Ph.D. in chemistry at Harvard, she said, when she saw a
``Nova'' series on PBS about chimps using sign language, dolphin
research and the question of why birds sing. She wanted to change
fields, but her advisers discouraged her, she said, so she
continued her studies in chemistry, continuing nonetheless to read
everything she could on animal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When she applied for her first grant to study bird behavior from
the National Institutes of Health, she said, ``there were reviews
asking me what I was smoking,''she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not at all surprised a chimpanzee can do this,''
she went on.``You can't imagine _ people said birds were stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pepperberg expects Alex to live at least another 20 years.
Meanwhile, she has added two new birds to the lab. Besides Griffin,
now 4 years old, there is Kyaaro. She believes both exhibit
symptoms of attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex doesn't like either of them,'' she said. ``Kyaaro is
weird. Griffin is a threat.'' Right now she is trying to train
Griffin to do some of the things Alex can do.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, who learned the word ``wool'' only recently, has been
clinging to it the way a child clings to a new-found possession.
One day recently Dr. Pepperberg held up a purple refrigerator
letter S and asked, ``What sound is purple?'' Griffin stared at the
letter. But from the other side of the laboratory Alex made the
sound for him, ``SSS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buttinsky,'' Dr. Pepperberg said to Alex and turned back to
Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sound?'' she asked Griffin again, holding up the S.
``What sound?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wool,'' said Griffin. He has a long way to go.

REGULATORS EASE RESTRICTIONS ON CABLE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal regulators announced revised rules Friday that AT&AMP;T
officials said will allow them to complete their $58 billion
takeover of MediaOne Group by next winter without requiring any
divestment of MediaOne franchises.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission move should also allow
AT&AMP;T to pursue plans to offer local telephone service through
upgraded cable systems to 50 to 55 percent of all American
households, competing with the Baby Bells it was forced to divest
in 1984 and other local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   And the FCC move could also make it easier for AT&AMP;T-MediaOne to
make a bid to buy or swap franchises elsewhere for the Cablevision
franchises in Boston, adjacent Brookline and 37 Massachusetts
communities. Cablevision has said it plans to sell them by
mid-November to focus on its New York region, and MediaOne, with
1.1 million Bay State customers, has been widely seen as the most
logical buyer.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T owns a 33 percent stake in Cablevision and has 9 percent
voting control. Swapping Massachusetts Cablevision properties for
some of the ownership stake would apparently be one way for AT&AMP;T to
enhance its already densely clustered Bay State operations while
staying within federal ownership guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's long-awaited ruling, the FCC said it would maintain
its 30 percent cap on the number of television homes a single
company can control.
</P>
<P>
   But the FCC voted to change the way that number is calculated,
measuring actual customers rather than homes passed by cable
service and including in the total homes served by satellite dishes
and other wireless systems. That effectively raises the limit on
the share of cable customers AT&AMP;T could control to 36.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters, AT&AMP;T chairman C. Michael
Armstrong said the company understands that the FCC is not counting
toward the cap MediaOne's 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner
Entertainment, which has 11 million customers. As a result,
Armstrong said, AT&AMP;T will be under the 30 percent overall cap even
after adding MediaOne customers to the former TCI franchises it
bought earlier this year for $55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, however, would not say how close AT&AMP;T thinks it is to
the 30 percent figure. Even though it poses no obstacle to the
MediaOne deal, Armstrong's top lawyer, Jim Cicconi, said AT&AMP;T
continues to oppose the 30 percent figure as ``artificial and
arbitrary'' and will appeal it to the FCC or in court.
</P>
<P>
   The old rule is being challenged in federal appeals court by
Time Warner, with arguments scheduled for December. Cicconi said
AT&AMP;T thinks 40 percent is a more realistic cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new cap permits us to proceed with the MediaOne deal. This
very much adds to the certainty of that deal completing,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T and MediaOne, which had sunk recently amid Wall
Street uncertainty the deal would ever close, rallied Friday. AT&AMP;T
rose 1/2 to 47 7/16, while MediaOne jumped 1 3/4 to 73 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   FCC chairman William E. Kennard said his agency wants to make it
easier for cable companies to compete for local telephone business
and Internet access. ``The cable industry is a logical provider of
those services, and we want them to move aggressively,'' Kennard
said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong and Cicconi also voiced confidence that the terms of
the FCC ruling will not require the company to sell Liberty Media
Group, a cable channel operator formerly affiliated with TCI that
trades as a separate tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no interest in programming,'' Armstrong said. ``Our
interest is in distribution and extending our local exchange
competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Kimmelman of Consumers Union, which has strongly
opposed the AT&AMP;T cable deals, said, ``The control of so many wires
into the home as a sole provider, irrespective of how much
programming you own, gives you enormous influence and power over
the programming decisions'' and represents another downside for
consumers to the MediaOne takeover.

UN'S ROBINSON RECALLS `TERRIBLE STORIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bless Mary Robinson for all that she hears.
</P>
<P>
   As the United Nations' high commissioner of human rights for the
past two years, Robinson has traveled the world, choosing a path of
misery, listening to tales of great sorrow from Indonesia to Sierra
Leone to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   She was presented Friday with the 1999 J. William Fulbright
Prize for International Understanding Friday at the State
Department, the last in a recent series of plaudits for her ability
to elevate the issue of human rights around the world, to expand
its definition to include economic and social rights, and to stand
up to bullies, on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the former president of Ireland said in an interview that
the job, while richly rewarding, has been exceedingly difficult.
``It took the first year to turn the office around from a
management point of view to focus on issues of great concern,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in two years of travel, she said, the stories have taken an
emotional toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the burden of listening,'' she said. ``The burden
should be shared. I've listened to so many terrible stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they came tumbling out: ``I sat in a mosque in Sierra Leone
where I listened to a husband and wife tell me how their six
children were killed right in front of them. In Pristina, I met
several human rights activists that I had read extensively about,
and one widow told me the exact details about how her husband was
killed on the 24th of March, just as the NATO bombing started, and
how the killers tried to get her son to kill the father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw pregnant women, and children, with arms amputated in
Sierra Leone. In Darwin (Australia), I met people from East Timor
who didn't know what had happened to their families,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates have found some fault in Robinson's
careful handling of China, wishing that she were more
confrontational. And some believe that she could have more
skillfully applied pressure on Rwanda, instead of pulling out her
UN mission to protest the restrictions Rwanda had imposed.
</P>
<P>
   But most offer praise, especially when they compare her to the
UN's first high commisioner for human rights _ her predecessor,
Jose Ayala Lasso of Ecuador _ who was described as ``practically
invisible'' by Curt Goering, deputy executive director of Amnesty
International USA.
</P>
<P>
   ``She calls things as she sees them,'' Goering said Friday.
``She's not hesitant to criticize anyone, including the United
States over its use of the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed Brody, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch in New
York, cited Robinson's work on East Timor. She was the first to
call for a commission of inquiry into atrocities committed by
militias following East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not afraid to describe the atrocities there, which is
very difficult when you are talking about the fourth most populous
nation in the world,'' Brody said. ``She earned herself a lot of
enemies because she is so forthright.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington over the past two days, Robinson met with White
House and State Department officials and members of Congress on a
broad range of topics, including the need for the United States to
pay its $1.6 billion debt to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fulbright award ceremony Friday, Robinson focused on what
was most dear to her. Borrowing the words of Eleanor Roosevelt,
Robinson noted that ``human rights begins in small places, in the
world of individual person.'' And, she said, ``it must be
understood that all human rights must be equally championed and
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of education for millions around the world especially
``works against young girls, who account for two-thirds'' of
dropouts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson spoke about sending out representatives who focus on
the right for education for all. And she spoke about funding small
efforts to encourage learning, such as one in Nepal in which a
teacher walks to 15 high schools to talk about human rights or one
in Burundi where copies of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights are handed out in refugee camps, including one recent
session for 200 women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my job as a voice for the victims, someone who can stand
up to the bullies, confront foreign ministers, even prime
ministers,'' she said in the interview. ``And when I hear about
extreme poverty, I immediately think of the impact on women and how
vulnerable it makes them.''

AS GOP LOSSES MOUNT, MODERATES BREAK RANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt knew. He saw it coming.
</P>
<P>
   In the results of the 1998 election, Newt Gingrich could forsee
the aggravating task of leading a slim Republican majority, primed
for confrontation by its conservative ideology, through times that
called for moderation and maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   So Gingrich stepped down. And House Speaker Dennis Hastert and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott inherited that duty, with
predictable results. The GOP leaders have confronted their
Democratic foes over impeachment, war, tax cuts, Social Security,
and health care in the last year _ and lost almost every time.
</P>
<P>
   Motivated by political self-interest and philosophy, moderate
Republicans have repeatedly broken ranks, as scores of defectors
demonstrated this week in passing the patients' bill of rights
legislation in the House. Two weeks ago, President Clinton vetoed
the GOP's prized tax cuts with political impunity.
</P>
<P>
   With tough fights coming up on the federal budget, raising the
minimum wage, and reforming the campaign-finance system, the GOP
congressional leaders face further defections and potential defeats
as they move into an election year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican woes in Congress are no fluke, but symptomatic of
a test the party faces in the presidential race as well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most prominent new critic of the Republican Congress
is the party's front-runner, Texas Governor George W. Bush, who
picked fights with the Capitol Hill conservatives twice in one week
in an attempt to distance himself from their attitudes and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year's election is the Republican Party's to lose, and it
is not beyond us to do that,'' said Mike Murphy, a media adviser to
the presidential campaign of GOP Senator John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its setbacks, the GOP retains an opportunity to keep
control of both houses of Congress and capture the White House next
year _ a goal it hasn't achieved since the days of Dwight D.
Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win the presidency we will hold the Congress,''
predicted conservative political consultant Lyn Nofziger. ``I don't
think anybody is going to beat George Bush except George Bush. He
would have to do something really dumb. It's his to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet success on a national scale appears possible only if the
party's right wing gives its candidates some slack to maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   ``What George Bush is doing right now is very much what we tried
to do in 1990 and 1991,'' said Al From, director of the moderate
Democratic Leadership Council. ``Bush is trying to take the party
to the center, trying to redefine the party so it isn't viewed by
the voters as the crazy right-wing Republican Party in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   After two presidential elections in which the party averaged 39
percent of the vote, Republicans face the question: Have they lost
enough times to learn the correct lesson?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid, but hopeful the Republican Party has learned from
1992 that the goal is to win the vote,'' said GOP pollster Frank
Luntz.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still conservatives who would rather lose than
move toward the center to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants a Republican moderate as president?'' asked radio
talk show host Rush Limbaugh. ``There's a vacuum here,'' he said of
Bush. ``There's no soulful passion to change things or implement a
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   In pleading for ``compassionate conservatism,'' Bush runs the
risk of demoralizing conservative activists who, alienated by the
governor's barbs, could sit on their hands next fall or vote for a
Reform Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP leaders in Congress are ``inept,'' Nofziger said, but
``I think George W. has to be careful. You don't abandon your base.
He needs the right wing of the party. He needs the Christian
conservatives. He needs the whole batch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also needs to clinch the nomination. And conservative
rivals like Steve Forbes wasted no time planning mailings, fax
attacks, and advertising campaigns to highlight Bush's alleged
betrayal of GOP conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy to change a political party. You go through
bloody fights,'' said From. ``I don't think it is clear yet whether
Bush will prevail or the Republicans in the House will.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, the congressional leaders got Bush to step back
from his remarks _ though not before dozens of GOP congressmen,
perhaps emboldened by their front-runner's critique, deserted the
party leaders on the patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP problem in Congress is a matter of mathematics.
Conservatives make up a majority of the Republican majority and so
set policy and elect the congressional leaders. But because
Republicans hold so slim an overall advantage, a coalition of
moderate Republicans and Democrats determine the fate of many
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who control the caucuses and committees _ many
of whom represent conservative districts or states in the South and
West _ keep pushing their leaders to confront the Democrats and
reject compromise. In doing so, they are faithfully representing
their consciences and constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't help themselves,'' said former GOP Senator Alfonse
D'Amato of New York. But ``there's no way they can win this
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   With a budget fight looming between Congress and the White
House, the House Republicans are facing further defeats, D'Amato
said. Clinton ``is going to let them hang,'' he said. ``He's got
all the cards.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet their budget priorities, the GOP leaders will have to
propose cuts in popular federal programs. Then Clinton ``is going
to come right after them,'' said D'Amato. ``If it's child care _
bang! _ he'll be there. If it's education _ bang! _ he'll be in
there. If it's not helping the farmers who've been ravaged _ boom!
_ he'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Republicans may be excused for their difficulty
interpreting the mixed message of an electorate that says it wants
a return to morality and order, but gives Clinton huge ratings in
polls, said Luntz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public yearns for values, but doesn't want anyone to tell
them how to act,'' he said. ``We have become social libertarians
within a spiritualistic framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Nofziger agreed. ``I think this is the most corrupt
administration (and) the most corrupt president in the history of
the country,'' he said. ``But thank God for term limits or he would
probably be elected again.''

XEROX WARNS OF LOWER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Xerox Corp., reeling from inroads that competitors are making
into its markets even as its own sales force is in disarray, warned
analysts Friday that its third-quarter results would be dismal.
</P>
<P>
   The document processing company, which is based in Stamford,
Conn., said its revenue would not top the $4.61 billion it reported
in the same quarter last year, and its earnings could be as much as
12 percent below the 53 cents per diluted share that it earned in
the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That comes to less than 47 cents a share, way below the 58 cents
a share that analysts had been predicting. Analysts rushed to
downgrade their earnings estimates for this year and next, and to
pull their ``buy'' recommendations off the stock. Xerox shares
plunged $10.25, or 24 percent, to close at $32.50.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was more than just fine-tuning estimates; this was a sign
of a really big disappointment,'' said Charles Hill, director of
research at First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Xerox, Richard Thoman, held a conference
call for analysts at 2 p.m. to reiterate his confidence in Xerox's
strategies. But he did not take questions, and few analysts seemed
appeased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously they are shell-shocked, but they did not say
anything new,'' said Peter Enderlin, an analyst at First Albany
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Enderlin and others hung up wondering whether Xerox would try to
bolster earnings with more job cuts or a stock buy-back. Both
scenarios are unlikely. Xerox has already cut more than 6,000 jobs
this year. ``They're pretty much tapped out on restructuring in
terms of cushioning the top line,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, who
covers Xerox for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Since Xerox last month agreed to buy Tektronix Inc.'s
color-printing business for $950 million in cash, it would be
difficult to budget for stock buy-backs soon. Some analysts
question whether that purchase itself was a sign of internal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should have been able to bring their own color product to
market,'' said Alexander Henderson, an analyst with Prudential
Securities Research.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Xerox is battling problems on all fronts. It is plagued
with weak sales in Brazil and Europe. It imports many of its
engines and other parts from Fuji Xerox, so the strong yen has been
a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Xerox's super-fast digital copiers, which command
prices as high as $250,000 and have virtually no competition, have
been slow. And fierce competition for the lower-margin, midpriced
market, particularly from multifunction devices that double as
printers and copiers, has kept Xerox from raising prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staking out the very high end has always paid off for Xerox,
but now customers are getting their needs met by less than
top-of-the-line product,'' said Hadley Reynolds, director of
research for the Delphi Group, a consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Customers are choosing the solutions they find most
acceptable, and increasingly that means us,'' said Nolan Sundrud, a
spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., which offers several
multifunction products.
</P>
<P>
   Canon Inc., meanwhile, introduced a new line of digital copiers
in March that sell for as much as $20,000 less than comparable
Xerox products.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's name is good enough to justify a $20,000 price
difference, and we're winning business that we've never been able
to compete for in the past,'' said Dennis Amorosano, assistant
director of networked office systems for Canon USA.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox's sales force is in poor condition to fight back. Xerox is
about to rejigger its sales territories, now organized by
geography, around particular customer industries instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realigning the sales force is probably a good long-term move,
but it is certainly creating instability now,'' said Benjamin
Reitzes, who follows Xerox for Paine Webber. Xerox acknowledges the
problem. ``It's been more disruptive than we anticipated, and our
execution was less than we wanted,'' said Judd Everhart, a Xerox
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the debacle left Xerox with one powerful thing going for
it: It is now a very cheap stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the selling was a bit overdone,'' Reitzes of Paine
Webber said. Nonetheless he removed his ``buy'' recommendation on
the stock. In contrast, Gibboney Huske of Credit Suisse First
Boston is suggesting that investors snap up Xerox shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock's cheap, it offers good risk return, and there's not
a lot more downside,'' she said.

NEW JAMA EDITOR SAYS SHE HAS PROTECTION BUILT INTO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the American Medical Association fired the editor of its
esteemed journal last January over a dispute about editorial
judgment, an editorial board member named Dr. Catherine D. De
Angelis angrily denounced the decision to AMA executive vice
president Dr. E. Ratcliffe Anderson, the axe-wielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gave an impassioned speech about how much damage they had
done to medicine and journalistic integrity, and how important this
journal is to American medicine,'' said a fellow editorial board
member.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the AMA named De Angelis editor-in-chief of the
Chicago-based Journal of the American Medical Association,
customarily known as JAMA, the world's largest-circulation medical
journal.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old De Angelis, a dean and pediatrics professor at
Johns Hopkins University, is the first woman to hold the editor's
post in JAMA's 116-year history _ not to mention the first
pediatrician and the first nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment, combined with the recent ascension of Dr.
Marcia Angell to the editor-in-chief's chair at the rival New
England Journal of Medicine, means that two of the world's top
medical journals are in the hands of women.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the significance of that, De Angelis made word-play
on her name and Angell's: ``It means that the devils are gone and
the angels are in...I'm joking!''
</P>
<P>
   Angell, asked the same question, shot back: ``There goes the
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the unusual confluence of female editorial
leadership may not last long. Angell holds an interim position at
the New England Journal, which she took last summer after the
Massachusetts Medical Society, its publisher, fired editor-in-chief
Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer in a dispute over the medical society's
intent to exploit the journal's name for commercial gain. The
medical society has just begun to look for a permanent replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect her life expectancy'' as editor ``will be longer
than mine,'' Angell said of De Angelis.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Angell and De Angelis find themselves at the twin
peaks of medical publishing at a moment when many are wondering if
any editor can hold the line against pressures that arise when
physician-interest groups are publishers of lucrative, influential
journals.
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis swears she can, and will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about that at all,'' she said in an interview.
She pointed to a new seven-member Journal Oversight Committee that
the AMA set up in June to protect the JAMA editor (who also
oversees nine other AMA journals and its website) from future
interference by AMA management.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new AMA ``editorial governance plan'' issued in
June, the new committee, which will contain only one AMA official,
must vote on ``any proposal to dismiss the editor-in-chief for any
reason'' and pass its recommendations on to the AMA board of
trustees. It will take a two-third majority of the trustees to fire
the next JAMA editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMA management recognizes and fully accepts the necessity of
editorial independence for the editor-in-chief at all times,'' the
``editorial governance plan'' declared.
</P>
<P>
   If that pledge is broken, De Angelis said Friday, ``there will
be no more JAMA, I can assure you.''
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis among observers is somewhat guarded.
</P>
<P>
   The new AMA policy ``offers quite a bit of protection, if it
works as advertised,'' Angell said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Blendon, a Harvard University health policy expert who is
on JAMA's editorial board, predicted that De Angelis would be able
to stand up to AMA pressures. ``They didn't pick her because she is
quiet on editorial independence,'' Blendon said. ``When George
Lundberg was fired, there was no one more vociferous, more angry,
and more eloquent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Blendon said De Angelis will likely ``be a
little bit more cautious'' than Lundberg, ``because that's her
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco, chief of general medicine at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and a JAMA columnist, remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, no matter what firewalls are put up or safeguards
there are on paper, I'd be surprised if over time the goals of the
AMA big boss and the goals of a first-class editor will be in
sync,'' Delbanco said.
</P>
<P>
   De Angelis made one clear distinction between herself and
Lundberg, who often said he was ``a journalist first, then a
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded of Lundberg's self-characterization, De Angelis
replied: ``I am a physician first, last, and always. I'll make
news, but in my own way _ as one of the keepers of the educational
and scientific flame.''

GOP SENATORS SCUTTLED TEST-BAN TREATY, CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ President Clinton Friday conceded defeat on his fight
to ratify a global nuclear test-ban treaty and lashed out at Senate
Republicans he charged were playing politics with international
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've treated this like a political document. This whole
thing is about politics,'' Clinton said during a joint news
conference with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   ``This treaty was never treated seriously,'' said Clinton, in
Canada to dedicate the new American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the treaty has huge implications for both nuclear
testing and for US foreign policy. But in his most direct attack on
Republican handling of the treaty issue to date, Clinton insisted
the matter had come down to simple, partisan politics at the
expense of international non-proliferation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about, `Burn us in 1999, because we're against the treaty
that 80 percent of the American people support, but please don't
burn us again in 2000,' '' Clinton said, referring to Senate
Republicans who are insisting that Clinton formally withdraw the
treaty and promise not to bring it up again for the remainder of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   While the president said he hoped the Senate would delay acting
on the document, he wasn't committing to keeping it out of Congress
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996 before
the United Nations, calling it one of the most important steps
toward achieving world peace. Ratification of the treaty would add
a key historic footnote to Clinton's troubled legacy as president.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty would ban underground and above-ground nuclear
testing, an agreement proponents say would curtail the behavior of
rogue nations who have or are working toward nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the treaty worry that the verification technology
is not sophisticated enough to keep other signers in line. Other
foes of the treaty take a fundamentalist, isolationist view that
the United States should not limit its military capability by arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   When Senate Republicans abruptly pushed for a ratification vote
_ after the treaty had sat dormant for two years _ the Clinton
administration mounted a heavy lobbying effort, including a White
House dinner for wavering senators and personal calls from
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Defense Secretary
William S. Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the votes,'' Clinton said bluntly Friday. White
House officials believe to be 15 or more votes short of the 67
necessary to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear whether the vote will be put off. Senate
Democrats were trying to convince Republicans to delay the vote,
tentatively scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican push for a vote is ``pigheaded,'' said Senate
minority leader Thomas Daschle. ``Our allies in Europe, they are
lobbying today saying what the Senate is doing is nuts, it is
wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the major nuclear testing treaty, then, has come
down to procedural sparring. The White House says scheduling the
vote is not in its hands but in the power of Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats say they might try the unusual tactic of
calling for a procedural vote to halt the treaty vote, a strategy
that would require a simple majority of senators, instead of the
two-thirds needed to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   That idea, in turn, ruffled Senate Republican leader Trent Lott,
who noted that such scheduling changes were traditionally made by
the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get an agreement'' to delay the vote, ``we will
oppose'' the Democratic procedural effort to stop it, Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, an outspoken Clinton foe, says Clinton
indeed has the power to stop the vote _ providing the president
makes the politically humiliating move of asking in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Helms also wants Clinton to promise not to bring the treaty up
again for the remainder of his presidency, a deal that would
deprive Clinton of his long-desired foreign policy credit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton at first indicated he would refuse. ``So they want me to
give them a letter to cover the political decision they have made
that does severe damage to the interests of the United States and
the interest of nonproliferation around the world? I don't think
so,'' Clinton said defiantly.
</P>
<P>
   But later, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart softened Clinton's
statement. ``It was not a blanket, sermonesque statement, `I will
not send a letter.' The intention there, I think, was conciliatory,
to say, ``Let's work together,' '' Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he is reluctant to agree not to bring up the treaty
again next year, since world events might make it necessary to
consider it again.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff is likely to continue over the weekend, as
Democrats search for a way to protect their president from a floor
vote, which would certainly result in a rejection of the treaty. If
there is a vote, it would be the first time since the League of
Nations vote during the Woodrow Wilson administration that a
foreign policy treaty was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is going to be a resolution until the last
minute on Tuesday,'' said a Democratic Senate aide close to the
talks. ``Feelings are running pretty strong on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the treaty are concerned that an out-and-out
rejection of the document would embarrass the United States. As the
world's only remaining superpower, the United States would look
arrogant by voting down a standard it has pleaded with the rest of
the world to adopt, analysts in support of the treaty say.
</P>
<P>
   Some nations are already irritated at the United States' refusal
to participate in the International Criminal Court, or to join the
international ban on land mines, noted Lawrence Korb of the Council
on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Without the treaty, ``the notion of being able to control this
stuff, and to manage the international system, is pretty much
shot,'' said Dan Doure, deputy director of political and military
studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.

PINOCHET EXTRADITION TO SPAIN GETS BRITISH OK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In the latest twist to a yearlong legal saga, a
magistrate cleared the way Friday for the extradition to Spain of
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former military dictator, on charges that
he tortured political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in Bow Street Magistrates Court, Metropolitan Magistrate
Ronald D. Bartle ruled that 35 charges of torture and conspiracy
against Pinochet were legally sound and should be resolved at a
trial in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers have 15 days to file an appeal, and it could
be months before the case is finally resolved. The final decision
to extradite Pinochet rests with Home Secretary Jack Straw, who
will rule after all legal appeals are exhausted. But just when that
will be is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said Bartle's decision makes it likely that
Pinochet's only chance at avoiding extradition is to ask Straw to
let him return to Chile on humanitarian grounds because of failing
health.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle had excused the 83-year-old Pinochet from attending
Friday's hearing after being told the former dictator had suffered
two minor strokes recently at the mansion in Surrey where he is
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But, apparently expecting the decision to go against him,
Pinochet prepared a defiant statement which his lawyer, Clive
Nicholls, read out in court after Bartle's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not guilty of the crimes of which I am accused,''
Pinochet wrote. ``Spain has not produced a single piece of evidence
which shows that I'm guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet said Spain's attempts to extradite him for alleged
crimes that took place after Pinochet led a coup against the
democratically elected president Salvador Allende in 1973 amounted
to a violation of Chile's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events in Chile have nothing whatsoever to do with
Spain,'' Pinochet wrote. ``It has long been clear that my
extradition is politically motivated and being pursued purely for
political reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But while acknowledging that the Pinochet case has aroused
political passions in which left-wingers see Pinochet as ``the arch
devil'' and right-wingers see him as ``the savior of Chile,''
Bartle insisted his decision was based on a dispassionate
interpretation of extradition law.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle rejected defense arguments that 33 of the charges should
be thrown out because they were not included in the original
charges filed by Spanish authorities. He also rejected the defense
claims that Spain did not have jurisdiction over crimes committed
against non-Spaniards, accepting the argument by lawyers acting for
the Spanish authorities that an international convention outlawing
torture gives jurisdiction to all signatories.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling triggered celebrations outside the court, where
several hundred Pinochet opponents gathered under the imposing
columns of the newly refurbished Royal Opera House to await the
verdict. Their hands daubed in red paint to symbolize the blood
they say is on Pinochet's hands, they sang songs and chanted
slogans against Pinochet and former British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who earlier this week voiced a spirited defense of
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling prompted cheers in Chile among hundreds of
anti-Pinochet protesters, who also chanted ``Pinochet, prisoner!
Pinochet, prisoner!'' as they marched in downtown Santiago. The
ex-dictator's supporters burned British and Spanish flags in
protest, and Chile made a new effort to get Pinochet for trial at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Among those demonstrating in London was Teresa Villalobos, 49,
whose brother Manuel is among the estimated 3,000 ``disappeared''
who vanished and are believed to have been murdered by the Pinochet
regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crimes that happened in Chile under Pinochet were
unthinkable,'' said Villalobos, who had black and white photographs
of her brother and her cousin, who also disappeared, pinned to her
jacket. ``But there is a new climate about human rights, and I
think this is part of a campaign to build a better society.''
</P>
<P>
   Villalobos, who traveled from her home in Santiago to be present
for the ruling, said she was appalled by Thatcher's ringing defense
of Pinochet. Thatcher used her first speech at a Conservative Party
conference in nine years to accuse the government of Prime Minister
Tony Blair of collaborating in the ``political kidnapping'' of
Pinochet. Thatcher described Pinochet as Britain's ``only political
prisoner,'' and said it was a disgrace the way Britain was treating
its staunchest ally during its 1980 war with Argentina over the
Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The woman has no humanity,'' Villalobos said of Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's legal saga here is a long and convoluted one. Last
October, British police arrested Pinochet as he recovered from back
surgery in a London clinic. They were acting on a warrant issued by
a Spanish magistrate who wants to try Pinochet for human rights
abuses committed during and after the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the House of Lords, England's highest court of
appeal, ruled 3-2 that Pinochet did not enjoy immunity from
prosecution because he was a head of state. But that ruling was set
aside after one of the judges failed to disclose his links to
Amnesty International, one of the human rights groups seeking
Pinochet's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In March, another panel of Law Lords ruled that Pinochet must
face an extradition hearing, but that he was immune from
prosecution for crimes committed before 1988, when a United Nations
convention against torture took effect in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Even if extradited and convicted, Pinochet will not be
imprisoned because Spain forbids incarceration of anyone over 75.
But human rights advocates say his prosecution will set a precedent
and put other despots on notice that they will face international
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision confirms that the world is becoming a smaller
place for people who commit atrocities,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy
director of Human Rights Watch.

<P>
   SAMSO, Denmark _ Imagine a Danish landscape: half-timbered
houses sagging at midbeam, farmlands sloping toward the sea,
crenelated church belfries with their masonry step notches marching
up the sides.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays that's an incomplete portrait. Bringing it up to date
means making room for sleek, silvery towers with long-bladed
propellers on top.
</P>
<P>
   Danes are putting windmills _ or wind turbines, as the modern
versions are called _ all over their picturesque place. There are
small private ones in backyards, larger ones in open fields and
rows of giant industrial-strength ones standing single file in
shallow offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
   The move to wind power makes particular sense for Denmark, an
intensely ecology-minded country that is a low-lying assemblage of
407 islands and a large peninsula in one of the breeziest corners
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wind power has also become a big business for Denmark. It
exports windmills to 35 countries and accounts for more than 50
percent of all the devices manufactured in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we decided 25 years ago that we wouldn't have nuclear
power, we had to ask ourselves, `What do we do now?' '' Soren
Hermansen said as he walked through a pasture behind his house to
show a visitor the windmill he and his neighbors own.
</P>
<P>
   Hermansen, called an energy adviser on his business card, has
returned to the island where he was born 40 years ago to help Samso
fulfill its designation as the chosen site for a 10-year government
project to convert an entire Danish community into one powered 100
percent by renewable energy. Samso won over four other finalists by
submitting a plan to live a decade from now on nothing but solar,
wind and biomass energy from organic waste and agricultural
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the venture turns on the participation of the
island's 4,400 inhabitants, which by law must be voluntary. No
problem in Denmark. Signs of people's concern with the environment
are anywhere you look.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods across the country have recycling centers full of
glossy field-green deposit boxes with stenciled instructions on
their sides identifying what you should put in them. To coax people
out of their cars, the country has set up more than 6,000 miles of
marked cycle routes, and in downtown Copenhagen there are
distinctly colored public bicycles activated by putting coins in
the handlebars to enable people to taxi themselves around.
</P>
<P>
   Products with red and white ``stats-kontrolleret ekologisk''
stickers take up more and more supermarket shelves, crowding out
the space left for foods that don't carry the state's additive-free
assurance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Denmark became the first European country to create a
Cabinet-level ministry dealing exclusively with the environment. It
now boasts that half of all waste is recycled and 80 percent of new
paper is made from used paper. Businesses pay a tax on their carbon
dioxide emissions, with the revenue going to finance various energy
conservation and efficiency plans.
</P>
<P>
   Magrethe Auken, 54, a member of the Danish Parliament, excitedly
interrupted a conversation about ecology to point out the window to
the parking lot below her office. ``Those spaces used to hold eight
cars,'' she said, ``but now they've been freed up to hold 80
bicycles. Tell me another parliament in the world that would do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's largest public works project, the 9.5-mile, $2
billion link between Copenhagen and the Swedish city of Malmo due
to open in July, was delayed for years by environmental concerns.
There were doubts about its effect on water flow from the Baltic,
and on the birds, frogs, ducks and seals that breed on a limestone
island in the straits separating the two countries. At considerable
added expense, an artificial landfill island was formed to enable
builders to tunnel under the sea and not disturb the fragile watery
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen is focusing its
promotion these days on its success in bringing its heating and
lighting systems under central control, converting its vehicles to
electricity, turning its kitchen waste into feed for 1,400 pigs,
monitoring the watering of its acres of flowerbeds and clearing up
its algae-choked lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out to explain to people why moving to renewable
energy is a good thing,'' Hermansen said, ``it helps to make the
economic argument about saving oil costs, selling wind power and
getting government money. But there is a good feeling among Danes
about self-sufficiency and the environment I can play on, too.
Danes have a romantic attachment to the idea of leaving land
unharmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservation in Denmark not only benefits from high levels of
public support _ 80 percent of the country's windmills are owned by
individuals or cooperatives _ but also profits from the individual
ingenuity of people in places like Samso.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest windmills on the island, still spinning away
15 years after being put up, were built by a local plumber. A
gardener, Kai Alexandersen, 69, proudly pointed out two solar
panels on the roof of his toolshed and the nest of tubes and pumps
carrying the gathered power to his house.
</P>
<P>
   How had he managed to create and install the elaborate system,
he was asked. ``With these,'' he said, extending his weathered
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ways the project aims to achieve its goal: improving
home insulation; centralizing community heating and focusing it on
wood chip furnaces and straw-burning stoves; creating biogas from
manure, organic waste and potato tops from the island's principal
farm product, and gradually converting the island's fleet of cars
and vans to electricity. People who agree to take these steps get
grants from the government to help pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of powering all the vehicles and ferryboats with ethanol
were dashed when planners calculated that producing sufficient
rapeseed oil for the task would use up all the agricultural land on
the 17-mile-long island. Instead, Samso will deliver extra
wind-generated energy to the national grid to compensate for the
gasoline it burns.
</P>
<P>
   Wind energy today covers 7 percent of Danish electricity
consumption and will rise to 50 percent by 2030, according to the
Danish Ministry of Environment and Energy.
</P>
<P>
   This flat land of only 5.3 million people may be marginal to
many of the world's endeavors. But in terms of wind power
development, Denmark finds itself the hub of global activity.
</P>
<P>
   One person happy with Denmark's position at the center is Soren
Krohn, managing director of the Danish Wind Turbine Manufacturers
Association. ``The Danes,'' he said, ``were fortunate to be in the
right place at the right time with the right concept.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the best and worst of times in corporate
mergerville last week. On the one hand, investors were giddy over
MCI Worldcom's plan for a $130 billion all-stock merger with
Sprint, announced on Tuesday. Telecommunications stocks jumped on
the news of the gigadeal.
</P>
<P>
   One day earlier, though, a different merger hit the skids.
Mattel Inc., the toy giant with $4.8 billion in sales, stunned
investors with news that problems at its Learning Company
subsidiary, acquired less than five months earlier for $3.8
billion, would result in an after-tax loss of $50 million to $100
million in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This was a far cry from the $50 million that Mattel had expected
the division to earn in that period. The toy maker's stock plunged
30 percent that day, to $11.875. It ended the week at $11.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's woes illustrate the obvious but often overlooked fact
that not all corporate marriages are created equal. Some are wise;
others are breathtakingly foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for shareholders in a combined company, it is not
always easy to tell whether an acquisition will succeed. But with
more mergers taking place _ the dollar amount of combinations
worldwide is up 24 percent from last year, according to Thomson
Financial Securities Data _ investors need to be on the lookout for
disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, investors cannot always count on management to
uncover problems in a potential purchase, as the Mattel case shows.
When she announced the deal, Mattel's chairman, Jill E. Barad,
gushed, ``We are truly excited about the benefits to be realized
through the combination of our two great companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad was not available last week to comment on those
benefits. A Mattel spokesman said that the company had done due
diligence on the Learning Company and that its problems came as a
big surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard M. Schilit, president of the Center for Financial
Research and Analysis, said troubles at the Learning Company were
well-known for years. Mattel, Schilit said, ``bought a company that
had a lot of problems, and I don't think they did sufficient due
diligence before they bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   How can investors protect themselves from being bagged by a bad
acquisition? Two clues can signal problems, Schilit said, and both
were obvious enough for his company to issue a negative report on
Mattel last July.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign is a severe slowdown in sales growth at the
acquiring company, or even worse, a decline. Such a situation may
prompt management to make an acquisition because it will deliver a
quick boost to sales, not because it makes business sense.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel's revenues fell 8.1 percent in the March quarter of the
company's fiscal 1999 from the corresponding period a year earlier;
for the full year, they declined 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should also examine the company being acquired. The
picture at the Learning Company was not pretty. In the March
quarter, revenue growth fell to 4.2 percent from levels above 25
percent in each of the previous three periods. And cash flow from
operations plunged from $28.2 million in the 1998 quarter to a
negative $42.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Schilit said, the Learning Company was a classic case
of an acquisition that would come back to bite shareholders. The
only question now is why Ms. Barad couldn't see the pig in this
poke.

   Rara Avis at GM: A Director From Japan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's chief executive, was named to the
board of General Motors last week, he joined only a handful of
other Asian executives who are directors of United States
companies. Among the few are Goro Watanabe, vice chairman of Mitsui
Chemicals, who serves on DuPont's board, and Minoru Makihara,
chairman of Mitsubishi, who is on IBM's.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the corporate talk of globalization, big business
often leaves its multinationalism at the board-room door.
</P>
<P>
   John T.W. Hawkins, a managing director at Russell Reynolds
Associates, a headhunting firm in New York, says very few
executives are willing to cross the Pacific to attend frequent
board meetings. And given the turmoil in Asian economies, he added,
American companies have become even less willing to try recruiting
directors in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But companies are more likely to look to Europe, he said.
European directors can make a day trip out of a board meeting by
hopping on the Concorde, particularly if the company is based in
New York. No such snappy commutes are possible from Tokyo or
Seoul. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Reed Abelson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Whose Side Is He Really On? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The technology revolution reshaping Wall Street was the topic
for a daylong conference on Wednesday at Pace University in New
York City. But the ambient excitement about the new E-market was
not shared by the luncheon speaker, Alan C. (Ace) Greenberg,
chairman of Bear Stearns Cos.
</P>
<P>
   After amusing the crowd with homespun anecdotes about his
famously pithy office memos, Greenberg, who is 72, played down the
significance of online brokerage services and the advent of
electronic communications networks, or ECNs, the upstart trading
systems that are challenging traditional markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who owns a dog owns an ECN,'' Greenberg said, adding
that his firm wasn't jumping on that particular bandwagon. ``I
don't see the need for them.'' That may have come as a surprise to
the management of Strike, one of the new ECNs, whose big investors
include the Bear Stearns Companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Diana B. Henriques &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a Buyout, Life After Lilco &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William J. Catacosinos, former chairman of the Long Island
Lighting Co., who left in July 1998 amid an outcry over his $42
million golden parachute, has another act to stage. This time, the
scene is Texas, the plot the first leveraged buyout of an electric
utility.
</P>
<P>
   At the now-defunct Lilco, Catacosinos abandoned the Shoreham
nuclear project after billions of dollars were invested, and
electricity rates on Long Island soared. Now, at age 69, he is
leading an investor group that is offering $585 million plus the
assumption of $434 million in debt for TNP Enterprises, owner of
the Texas-New Mexico Power Co., with 229,000 customers in Texas and
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Though leveraged buyouts and the resulting debt have been
regarded as too risky for utilities, deregulation is changing the
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos and his group are getting close to completing the
deal after 98 percent of the shareholders approved the buyout late
last month. Federal and state regulatory approvals are still
needed. Catacosinos and his group have pledged that there will be
no layoffs. He has refused to comment further. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Agis Salpukas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too Much Rest for This Driver &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers, confirming what many suburbanites already
know, have reported that long-distance commuters suffer from
chronic sleep deprivation. But Thomas Purves, chairman and chief
executive of BMW's operations in the Americas, would like his
commute to be longer.
</P>
<P>
   Purves has a morning commute that many New Jersey residents can
only dream about: just a 10-minute drive, from Upper Saddle River
to Woodcliff Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the shortest commute I've ever had, and the pity of it
is I have the best car I've ever had,'' said Purves, who drives a
BMW 740i ($63,000 and provided by the company).
</P>
<P>
   A Scotsman who has lived in Europe for most of his career, he
moved to New Jersey this year. In the past, his commute stretched
to more than an hour. Now his biggest lament is, ``I can't
test-drive cars on the way home.'' &QL;

 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Christine Lagarde found out she was soon to
become the top partner at Baker &AMP; McKenzie, the world's
second-largest law firm, she called friends all over the globe for
advice on what to call herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairperson'' seemed to be a made-up word, she said. If she
shortened the title to simply ``chair,'' it would sound as if she
were becoming a piece of furniture. And one friend advised against
``chairwoman,'' surmising that some partners might vote for a man
next time, if only to have a ``chairman'' again.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Lagarde, who becomes the first woman to lead the
Chicago-based Baker &AMP; McKenzie, will be known as chairman, just
like her predecessor and the many men before him. Of the United
States' 20 largest law firms, Mayer, Brown &AMP; Platt is the only
other one with a woman in the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lagarde, who is French, lives in Paris and speaks Spanish
and English as well as French. She said this week that she may have
had an easier time getting the top job at Baker &AMP; McKenzie, which
has offices in 35 countries and lawyers of dozens of nationalities,
than she might have had at other American firms not so dispersed
over the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our firm has to be extremely tolerant and open,'' she said.
``Diversity is part of us. I think a lot of law firms tend to be
more traditional, more clubby. Women are not so included in those
firms as they are in my environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it took half a century for partners at Baker &AMP; McKenzie
to choose a woman to lead them. The firm is celebrating its 50th
anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Lagarde's elevation to the top job is a sign that women
are finally moving into power at some major law firms, which have
been behind even their clients in corporate America at promoting
women into management's upper echelons. (She was formally elected
late Thursday by an overwhelming majority of the firm's 548
partners, 91 percent of whom are men.)
</P>
<P>
   Just within the last year or so, partners of at least five of
the top 100 U.S. law firms _ including Pillsbury Madison &AMP; Sutro of
San Francisco and Hughes Hubbard &AMP; Reed of New York _ have chosen
women to lead them. But these firms all have far fewer lawyers than
Baker &AMP; McKenzie's 2,487.
</P>
<P>
   Debora de Hoyos, a managing partner at Mayer, Brown, said:
``It's a simple fact of the passage of time. There are more women
now in the prime of their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while only about 5 percent of law school graduates in
1970 were women, that figure is now closer to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lagarde, 43, also becomes one of the youngest partners to
manage Baker &AMP; McKenzie. She succeeds John Klotsche, now 57, who
was 53 when he took over.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lagarde said she believed women were now beginning to move
into higher positions because some clients were demanding it. More
corporations have hired women as corporate counsels, she said, and
in turn, those lawyers are asking that the teams of outside lawyers
they hire look more like their legal departments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ms. Lagarde said, women at law firms now have at
least a few female colleagues as role models. She said that one of
hers was a female partner in Baker &AMP; McKenzie's Paris office who
had hired her in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the only female partner in the office at that time,''
Ms. Lagarde said, ``yet she was running the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker &AMP; McKenzie has also changed its compensation structure so
that women lawyers get three months' paid maternity leave, Ms.
Lagarde said. While she said she had no plans to change other
policies at the firm to help women, she added that she hoped her
election would help convince many of the firm's lawyers _ male and
female _ that women can excel in management as much as men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I'm a she and not a he, that in itself is
helpful to a lot of female lawyers,'' she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Baker &AMP; McKenzie _ the United States' largest law firm in number
of lawyers and, until the merger this summer of the British firm
Clifford Chance with various other firms, the world's largest as
well _ has had its share of scandals involving allegations of
sexual harassment and discrimination because of sex or sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a secretary won more than $3 million in damages after
suing the firm, alleging that she had been sexually harassed by one
of the partners. Part of the film ``Philadelphia'' is said to be
based on the story of a Baker &AMP; McKenzie lawyer who claimed he had
been fired when he contracted AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ingrid Beall, then a 65-year-old senior tax partner,
filed a lawsuit charging that she had been pushed aside in the firm
because of her sex and age. ``This is a firm that has the feeling
that women are second-class citizens,'' Ms. Beall said at the time.
``You are not supposed to be as good as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lagarde said that in her 18 years at the firm she had
never felt discriminated against because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   She said she did remember one business deal she was working on
with a male lawyer at the firm. While both she and the other lawyer
were partners, she said, ``our clients were convinced that I was
his assistant. I never worked for them again.''
</P>
<P>
   An expert in employment and antitrust law, Ms. Lagarde has
worked for clients like Levi's, Great Lakes Chemical and the French
company Finacor. From 1991 to 1995, she was co-managing partner of
Baker &AMP; McKenzie's Paris office. In 1995, she was nominated to the
firm's executive committee, where she was the liaison for 11
offices in Western Europe. She served as chairman of the firm's
European regional council from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She became a partner in 1987 at the age of 31, younger than
average.
</P>
<P>
   As the mother of two boys _ Pete, 13, and Tom, 11 _ Ms. Lagarde
said she had learned to switch quickly between her roles of
high-powered lawyer and caring mother. She said that although she
has to be away from her children a lot because of her business
travels, she tries to make it up to them when she is at home.
</P>
<P>
   And she makes sure she calls the boys in the morning before they
leave for school and at night before they go to sleep, no matter
what time it is in the country where she is working. ``If that
means waking up at 2 a.m.,'' she said, ``then so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Lagarde will still be based in Paris, she will have
to spend a great deal of time either at the firm's Chicago base or
at its offices in New York, London, Moscow and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   When she, her husband and her sons are together on weekends,
they often travel to their country house in Normandy, where they
ride bicycles together or plant flowers and vegetables in a large
garden.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Eachran Gilmour, who runs a business in Poland,
said he was not surprised when he learned his wife would get the
top job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are more employable and reliable, and they're smarter,''
Gilmour said. ``Males have to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that neither he nor his wife had been left giddy by
her new status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't turn my head,'' he said of Ms. Lagarde's new title.
``It doesn't turn her head either. It's a job.''
</P>
<P>
   John Conroy, Baker &AMP; McKenzie's managing partner for its offices
in the United States, said Ms. Lagarde was a lawyer who ``puts
clients first.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was selected on her merits,'' he said, ``but it's a
terrific bonus that she's a female.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lagarde's energy is apparent even in her choice of hotels
during her frequent business trips. As a former member of the
French national team of synchronized swimmers, she chooses only
hotels with pools, so she can squeeze in an early-morning swim.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice she would give to other lawyers who want to
run their law firms, Ms. Lagarde did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grit your teeth, because it is a matter of resilience, stamina
and energy,'' she said. ``And never try to imitate what the boys
do.''

<P>
   When John Sweeney took the helm of the AFL-CIO four years ago,
the labor movement was spiraling downward. It was steadily losing
membership, politicians dismissed it as a toothless has-been, and
much of the public viewed it as an irrelevant dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, on the eve of the labor federation's
convention in Los Angeles, things have turned around big time for
big labor.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley are tripping
over each other to win the AFL-CIO's crucial endorsement for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Lawmakers are newly attentive
to labor's revived muscle as unions play a heavyweight role in
Congress, pushing for a patient's bill of rights and a higher
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Unionized workers at DaimlerChrysler and Boeing have hit grand
slams in their latest contracts. And in February, unions pulled off
their biggest organizing victory in six decades, organizing 74,000
Los Angeles health-care workers in one swoop.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Sweeney's preaching about the need to reverse
organized labor's slide in membership _ its ranks peaked at 21
million in 1979 before shrinking to a low of 16 million in 1997 _
unions expect to organize more than 500,000 new members this year,
more than five times the number the year Sweeney took office.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it seems, labor has so much cachet that doctors,
psychologists, graduate teaching assistants, limousine drivers and
even fashion models are rushing to join unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeney has dramatically increased labor's visibility,'' said
former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich. ``He's turned the AFL-CIO
into a more formidable political force. I haven't met anyone who
doesn't believe John Sweeney has been terrific for organized labor.
But having said that, the obstacles for labor are still very
large.''
</P>
<P>
   American unions are still in many ways swimming against the
tide. Globalization is putting downward pressure on union wages as
companies continue to close unionized factories and move work
overseas. The nation's recent explosion in jobs is concentrated in
small business and high technology, where unions have made little
headway.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America has become far more aggressive in battling
unionization drives, while Republican majorities in the House and
Senate continually propose hostile legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not to mention the repeated corruption scandals,
which seem to turn organized labor's progress into two steps
forward and one step backward.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, many union officials acknowledged that if unions
did not reverse their membership decline, they would soon have
little power left. The reason: if only 15 percent of an industry
was unionized, unionized companies could make strong arguments that
they would be unable to compete with the 85 percent that was
nonunion if they were generous at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Today, unions represent 13.9 percent of the work force, down
sharply from 35 percent in the 1950s. Many economists say labor's
declining power is a major reason why wages for most Americans have
climbed more slowly than inflation since 1979.
</P>

<P>
   Sweeney won the AFL-CIO's presidency after he and several other
union presidents conspired to push out his predecessor, Lane
Kirkland. They complained that Kirkland, who died last August,
seemed to pay more attention to helping workers in Poland than in
the United States.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   From his first day as AFL-CIO president, Sweeney's top goal has
been to reverse the labor movement's decline in numbers and power _
and he recognized that, to do that, he had to rejuvenate labor's
oh-so-boring image and to form alliances across society.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest successes was creating Union Summer, a
program in which more than 1,000 college students worked as summer
interns, persuading many of them that improving the lot of workers
was a cause worth devoting their lives to. The AFL-CIO has set up a
program called ``street heat'' where scores of union activists in
more than a dozen cities instantly materialize for raucous
demonstrations during labor disputes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In an unusual high-tech turn, the AFL-CIO is planning to make
computers and Internet service available to its 13 million members
at discounted prices, with an eye to tying workers closer together
and making it easier to mobilize them. With the push of a button, a
union president could e-mail tens of thousands of members to urge
them to e-mail Congress to push, say, for a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday in Los Angeles, the AFL-CIO is kicking off a
campaign to cooperate with immigrant groups as part of an effort to
make labor focus more on immigrants' needs. The hope is to attract
more immigrants to unions and help improve the lives in bottom-rung
jobs like janitors, hotel maids and farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has deliberately increased the movement's focus on
low-wage workers, after the AFL-CIO was perceived for years as
being preoccupied with labor's well-paid elite in auto plants and
steel mills. By focusing more on lower-rung workers, Sweeney has
improved the movement's moral stature, causing hundreds of
academics and members of the clergy to throw their support behind
labor in a way not seen in decades.

</P>
<P>
   Even some of his most vocal opponents grudgingly give Sweeney
credit. ``Ever since Lane Kirkland passed away this summer, we
heard how his work in fighting communism around the world is what
he will be remembered for,'' said Jeffrey McGuinness, president of
LPA, a Washington-based management association that represents 250
major companies. ``John Sweeney will be remembered for
reinvigorating the labor movement and getting back to basics. His
job is to make the labor movement grow again, and he is moving
aggressively in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the biggest change wrought by Sweeney is to get the
AFL-CIO and its member unions to focus far more on recruiting new
members _ the key to the movement's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, unions on average spent less than 3 percent of
their budgets on organizing, but Sweeney has persuaded many unions
to raise that to 10 percent of their budget. The hotel and
restaurant employees' union now spends more than 30 percent of its
budget on organizing, while the union that Sweeney once led, the
Service Employees International Union, now spends 45 percent of its
budget on organizing.
</P>
<P>
   That is paying off. The service employees' union, which has more
than 400 full-time organizers, is expected to see its membership
jump by nearly 200,000 this year, to 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Every few weeks this year, Sweeney has issued news releases
boasting of another impressive organizing win. After nearly a
century of trying, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and
Textile Employees successfully organized 5,200 workers at six
Fieldcrest Cannon plants in Kannapolis, N.C. _ the heart of
anti-union country.
</P>
<P>
   In Puerto Rico, which recently gave its government workers the
right to join unions, about 66,000 public employees are expected to
vote to unionize this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   These developments make AFL-CIO officials optimistic that, for
the first time in decades, unions might be able to stop the fall in
the percentage of workers belonging to unions. To achieve that
goal, unions need to organize at least 500,000 additional workers,
with the net increase several hundred thousand less than that
because of plant closings and workers at some companies voting to
oust their unions.
</P>
<P>
   Some AFL-CIO officials say they hope to soon unionize 1 million
additional workers each year, but many labor experts say that may
be pie in the sky. The booming high-tech sector has resisted union
inroads, and unions still continue to lose nearly half of all
unionization elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step to revitalizing the labor movement is stop the
shrinking, and I believe that's happened.'' said Richard Hurd, a
Cornell University professor of labor relations. ``Does this
translate into a revitalized labor movement that's on a permanent
upward track? The answer to that, is it's still premature to say.''

GORE, BRADLEY HEADED FOR CONFRONTATION IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES _ The campaign paths of Al Gore and Bill Bradley lead
into the same room as the two contenders for the Democratic
presidential nomination make their pitches to 3,000 hard core
Democrats here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore struggles to regain a solid footing in the campaign,
this will be the first head-to-head confrontation by the
candidates. For the vice presdient, it is an opportunity to show
that his downward spiral is not permanent. For Bradley, it is a
chance to woo the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected, sources said, to be far more direct in his
criticism of Bradley than ever before. Building on a theme he has
been developing for a couple of weeks, the vice president will
assail Bradley for retiring from the Senate during the Gingrich
Congress, and abandoning fights to raise the minimum wage, support
abortion rights, protect the environment, and help farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will particularly rap Bradley on his commitment to farmers,
noting that the former New Jersey senator missed a key farm vote in
1996 because he was on a book tour, sources said. That vote was on
a Democratic alternative to the Republicans' Freedom to Farm Act,
which would have given farmers more of a safety net during hard
times. The criticism will come on the heels of Bradley's
announcement Friday of his agriculture plan, to provide $5.5
billion of direct, emergency payments to farmers when prices fall.
</P>
<P>
   But while Gore is going to take on Bradley, Bradley plans to
shrug off Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you can expect is he'll talk about many of the things
he's talked about in the course of the campaign,'' said Anita Dunn,
Bradley's communications director. ``Where he wants to lead the
country, about some of the big things government can do. He'll make
his case.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Bradley will spend they day campaigning before the
Jefferson-Jackson dinner, the Iowa Democratic Party's largest
annual fund-raiser at $60 a head. Both candidates will knock on
doors, with Gore seeking support in Ames and Bradley going house to
house in Des Moines. Gore will also be surrounded by teachers, a
reminder of his two endorsements from the National Education
Association and the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of good news for Gore after weeks of poor polling
results in New Hampshire and New York, he won the coin toss for the
dinner. He'll speak last, giving him the opportunity to jab Bradley
without reply. The last time the two candidates came close to
meeting was at the Democratic National Committee meeting two weeks
ago, where each spoke separately and neither saw each other. Their
next get-together will be in Hanover, N.H. on Oct. 28, at a
town-hall style meeting at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   Until Gore began showing signs of weakness, he studiously
avoided Bradley. For example, he skipped New Hampshire's Democratic
convention in Manchester earlier this year, rather than share a
stage with Bradley. Instead, he sent his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Gore has reversed course, calling on Bradley to
hold a series of debates about the issues every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore has taken to calling himself the underdog in New
Hampshire, Bradley's aides stress that their candidate is at a
disadvantage in Iowa's party establishment setting, which they
contend favors the ``establishment candidate'' Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like the Knicks going to play the Celtics in
the Garden,'' said Dunn. ``We're under no illusions about what the
crowd will be like and who has the home court advantage at this
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dunn said Bradley will stick to the game plan he
laid out for himself last year. That means talking about his vision
for the nation, rather than responding to every snipe from the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the last few weeks, as Gore's poll numbers began
slipping, the vice president began attacking Bradley on such things
as voting for aid to the Contras, voting for Ronald Reagan's budget
to slash social programs, for proposing a health-care plan that
Gore said would ``destroy'' Medicaid and undermine the solvency of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bradley has decided to ignore a longstanding rule in
politics _ don't let your opponent define you. Instead, the former
senator refuses to answer questions raised by Gore, or to explain
why he voted the way he did during 18 years in the US Senate. His
campaign says Bradley will not engage in mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons the Bradley campaign is doing so well is
that Bill Bradley has kept things so positive,'' said James
Shannon, a former Massachusetts congressman who actively supports
Bradley. ``I think the Gore campaign has fallen into a trap with
these attacks. Not just that they look desperate, but they tie
themselves to a political culture that people are tired of.''

 &HT;    Democrats settle in for Senate healthcare battle
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The day after winning his four- year crusade to
overhaul the nation's managed healthcare industry, Rep. Charlie
Norwood (R-Ga.) was resting and readying for what will likely be an
even rougher battle: negotiations with Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   To turn legislation Norwood authored with Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.) into law, he must win over senators assigned to a
House-Senate conference committee, the special panel of lawmakers
that will resolve the differences between both chambers' bills.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many differences, but none as controversial as a
provision in the House bill that gives patients the right to sue
their health care plans. The Senate rejected that provision when it
passed its version of the bill in July.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood plans to win senators over in exactly the same tenacious
way that he defied the wishes of House Republican leaders and
convinced 67 Republicans to vote for his legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill say Norwood's dogged pursuit of victory
is one reason for its passage. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
(D-Mo.) said he doubted that the bill would have passed against the
powerful health insurance lobby, ``if it had not been for the sheer
passion of Charlie Norwood and John Dingell.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) said he has supported Norwood's efforts
from the start, because doctors have repeatedly told him the woes
of dealing with HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of House Republican meetings where the
``leadership made its preference known,'' Barr said. ``But this was
an issue that every member had to decide for themselves,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about how he managed to defeat the House Republican
leaders, Norwood said that he did it the old-fashioned way: one
member at a time. He said he called, harangued and generally made a
pest of himself until he got their ear.
</P>
<P>
   He is likely to pursue the same strategy in dealing with Senate
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood, a dentist, left at 6 a.m. Friday for a trip to Honolulu
with his wife, Gloria, where he will address a dental convention as
the keynote speaker. After a few days on the beach, his staff
predicted that he would return ``all fired up and wired to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood didn't waste much time basking in glory Thursday night,
either. Immediately after his bill passed 275-151, he already was
looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be a bloody war in conference to get this right, but
they can't stop Charlie Norwood,'' said Norwood, racing down a
hallway in the basement of the Capitol to yet another news
conference to declare ``victory for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate leaders are expected to announce appointments
to the conference committee by the end of the session. But given
the complexity of the legislation, a final bill is not expected
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood will face tough opposition not only from senators who
oppose allowing patients to sue their health plans. The health
insurance industry also is planning an ad and lobbying blitz,
arguing that allowing such suits would drive up the cost of health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to take this to the American people,'' said Karen
Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans,
which represents over 1,000 managed care plans. ``We will help lead
the conversation rather than react to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's senators are on opposite sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Max Cleland will support a growing coalition of
senators who want to approve the Norwood-Dingell measure, said Bill
Johnston, senior policy adviser to Cleland.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Paul Coverdell said he stands behind the Senate
version of the bill that passed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I have some concerns about the managed care aspects of
the House bill, I am confident that the bill we ultimately agree to
will reduce the number of uninsured, protect an individual's right
to choose, prevent costs from rising, and guard against the
creation of a federal bureaucracy between patients and their
doctors,'' Coverdell said.

WHY HIGHER INTEREST RATES HAVEN'T FAZED AUTO MAKERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Whenever the Federal Reserve raises short-term
interest rates _ or even hints that it might do so, as it did on
Tuesday _ economists issue warnings about the consequences for
rate-sensitive industries, notably automobiles and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite two quarter-point rate increases over the summer,
the auto industry is thriving. August and September were among the
best months ever for auto sales. The 1999 model year, which ended
on Sept. 30, broke a sales record set in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the industry's continued strength may indicate that rate
increases are just slow to have an effect. But some economists are
saying that the spread of retail incentives and leasing, and the
aggressiveness with which manufacturers are using them, are
allowing the industry to minimize the effects of interest rate
increases _ at least for a while, and as long as the increases are
fairly small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car sales are not anywhere near as sensitive to interest rates
as they once were,'' said Cynthia Latta, the principal United
States economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, ``because manufacturers
will do anything to `move the metal,' as they say in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Curtin, the director of consumer surveys at the
University of Michigan, said the rate increases last summer have
had no apparent effect on the public's interest in buying new cars
and light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear from our data that the entire impact of the recent
rate increases has been on the housing market,'' he said. ``While
we would normally say that interest rate changes affect
rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, that has narrowed greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers softened the blow from rising interest rates during
the summer, mainly by using their auto financing subsidiaries to
subsidize new car loans and leases, offering rates as low as zero
percent for up to 36 months on some slow-selling car models.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fed, the average rate for four-year auto loans
from banks rose to 8.44 percent in August, the most recent month
for which data are available, from 8.30 percent in the second
quarter. But the average rate charged by domestic and foreign auto
makers for loans of similar maturity fell to 6.28 percent from 6.56
percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers are also charging about 8.5 percent now for loans on
models with no incentives. But they have a much lower average than
the banks because of the many subsidized loans.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, subsidizing car loans is expensive for the auto
makers. While auto industry profits are high, they would be far
higher without them. The rising cost of sales incentives has pulled
down the stocks of General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler
by 20 percent to 30 percent since it became clear in early May that
the Fed would raise rates.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers can afford the incentives, because they are
essentially passing along the considerable cost savings they are
demanding, and getting, from parts suppliers, said David Bradley,
an auto analyst at J.P. Morgan. ``The auto makers have stepped in
and have cushioned the impact'' of rising rates, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bussman, an economist at DaimlerChrysler, said discounts
were likely to remain widespread. Despite the auto market's overall
strength, no company wants to be the first to accept lower sales
and thereby lose market share, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lending arms of the big domestic and foreign auto makers are
in particularly good financial shape right now for a rate war. They
borrowed billions of dollars last winter, locking in low rates for
long terms.
</P>
<P>
   That has left auto loan rates less closely linked than usual to
the current rate for two-year Treasury notes, which leaped
11-hundredths of a percentage point last Tuesday, after the Fed's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry's rate resilience poses a potential problem
for the Fed, which has long followed the industry carefully. The
industry accounts for 4 percent of the nation's economic output,
and a much higher share of what used to be considered the
rate-sensitive portion of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Diane C. Swonk, chief economist at the Bank One Corp., said the
industry's new ability to accept higher rates might require the Fed
to raise rates slightly higher or faster than it would have
previously to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
   AlMOST nobody questions that a large rate increase, perhaps a
percentage point or more, would still hurt the industry. A big jump
would slow growth in incomes and employment while damaging consumer
confidence to the point that people would have less interest in
buying new automobiles, even with incentives available.
</P>
<P>
   Rate increases can also take as long as a year to affect the
economy, so the recent small increases could eventually catch up
with the auto industry. Higher rates have already slowed the pace
of mortgage refinancings. In recent years, many Americans have been
able to take out bigger auto loans because they have refinanced
home mortgages, reducing their monthly payments.
</P>
<P>
   Some auto executives, notably at DaimlerChrylser and Ford, have
nonetheless been suggesting lately that their companies are no
longer truly cyclical, and that they can remain profitable in an
economic downturn. But even economists who think that the industry
has begun moderating the effects of small rate increases say that
such views require considerable optimism.
</P>
<P>
   As Curtin put it, ``It's always at this point in an expansion
that an industry proclaims itself recession-proof.''

CHILEANS' RESPONSE TO PINOCHET RULING IS MOSTLY LOW-KEY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ Human rights activists celebrated while allies
of Gen. Augusto Pinochet expressed bitter disappointment, but
Chile's reaction Friday to an English court ruling that the former
dictator can be extradited to Spain was generally muted.
</P>
<P>
   There were small competing marches around Santiago, but they
remained peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the case has not had a significant effect on the
lives of the majority of Chileans, and that it has had only a
minimal impact on a tight presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless for about a third of the population, Pinochet's
fate remains a highly charged matter of national sovereignty and
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very bad ruling, the worst possible for Chile,''
said Jorge Prado, director of the Pinochet Foundation, a private
group that promotes the former dictator's image. About 200 hundred
Pinochet supporters gathered at the organization's headquarters,
where they watched the day's events on television in mostly subdued
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the ruling, 300 human rights advocates held a
candlelight vigil in the streets of Santiago. Members of the
Families of the Detained and Disappeared burst into cheers when the
announcement was broadcast on Chilean television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have waited for this moment for a very long time,'' said
Viviana Diaz, president of the group. ``We are extremely happy; we
are extremely emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials met privately through the day, but no new
diplomatic strategy emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government isn't surprised by this ruling,'' said Interior
Minister Raul Troncoso, who said the government would continue to
press for Pinochet's release on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The two main presidential candidates _ Ricardo Lagos, a
socialist running on a center-left coalition ticket, and Joaquin
Lavin, who leads a conservative coalition _ both called on the
British government to release Pinochet because of his failing
health.

POLITICS THREATENS BRAZILIAN UTILITY SALES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ He's up to his old tricks again. With
an eye to his political fortunes, the same maverick governor and
former president who provoked Brazil's currency crisis in January
by defaulting on his state's foreign debt is now seeking to
sabotage a crucial federal government program to privatize
state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding a call by Itamar Franco, the governor of Minas Gerais
state, the board of its electricity utility agreed on Thursday to
expel directors representing minority shareholders including two
American firms, AES Corp. and Southern Co. In 1997, they acquired a
one-third interest in the utility, known as Cemig, and have since
invested nearly $1 billion under a contract that Franco, backed by
a sympathetic state court, now refuses to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are completely shocked by the action taken by Minas
Gerais,'' said Richard Owen, vice president for Latin America and
the Caribbean for Southern, one of the biggest utilities in the
United States. ``This could reflect on the appetite foreign
companies have in future privatizations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco also has campaigned to block the privatization of Furnas
Electrical, a utility that supplies power to nearly half of
Brazil's 165 million people. Recently he went so far as to threaten
to divert the course of the rivers that feed the giant Furnas dam,
located in his state, if the utility is sold.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Franco has dispatched state military police to
conduct maneuvers in the area around the dam and has established a
command base there. Though he has not explicitly threatened to use
those forces to block private investors from taking control of
Furnas, he has cited the crucial role of the military police in
coups in 1932 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   To what extent the actions of Franco, who was elected governor
of Brazil's third-most populous state last year, are motivated by
ideology, as opposed to personal grievances, is hard to determine.
As president from 1992 through 1994, he ushered in a period of
economic stability, but most of the credit went to Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, who was his Finance Minister and is now serving a
second term as president.
</P>
<P>
   One of Franco's first acts after taking office in January was to
decree a moratorium on payment of his state's debts both to the
central government and to foreign creditors, which set off a crisis
that resulted in a 40 percent devaluation of the Brazilian
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opprobrium that earned him, Franco is said by
political analysts still to harbor hopes of returning to the
presidency when elections are held in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   His chances are considered slim, however, since many Brazilians
regard him as irresponsible and even clownish. Cartoonists and
comedians habitually mock the pompadour hair style that is his
trademark. They like to poke fun at his irascibility and penchant,
at 67, for romantic pursuits of women half his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Itamar came into office obsessed with screwing things up for
Cardoso as much as he could,'' said David Fleischer, a professor of
political science at the University of Brasilia and publisher of a
widely read political newsletter. ``He is totally vain, thinks he
is going to be Brazil's savior, and is thoroughly convinced he can
get the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying for several weeks to ignore Franco's latest
challenge, the federal government finally fired back on Oct. 1.
Asked at a luncheon of the Council of the Americas in New York
about Franco's behavior, Arminio Fraga, head of Brazil's central
bank, dismissed the former president as an eccentric whose actions
were unjustly tarnishing the entire country's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't think that is Brazil,'' Fraga was quoted as
saying in Brazilian news reports. ``That is Minas. If you are
minority investors, find another state and not Minas Gerais.''
</P>
<P>
   The political fallout has been both immediate and extensive. At
the behest of the governor's allies, Fraga this week was
``invited'' to explain his remarks to a congressional committee,
and talks aimed at getting Minas Gerais to end its debt moratorium
are said to have stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Franco himself has sued Fraga in a state court, seeking damages
for his remarks. He also has accused the Central Bank chief, who
has an American mother, of being more loyal to the United States
than Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While Franco's behavior is regarded with a certain amusement
here, it comes at a delicate moment. In a setback to the austerity
program Cardoso pledged to carry out as part of a $41.5 billion
rescue package signed with the International Monetary Fund last
November, the Supreme Court ruled last week that two important
taxes on civil servants were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's economic team has been scrambling to find new sources
of revenue to fill the gap left by that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga acknowledged in New York that ``we are very annoyed'' at
what he called the former president's potentially damaging efforts
to drive away private capital.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco's defiant stance has also, as the newspaper O Estado
de Sao Paulo noted in an editorial this week, ``given him political
vitality.'' In particular, he has scored points with nationalist
and populist groups on the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``A people who do not control their own sources of energy have
no autonomy,'' said Joao Pedro Stedile, leader of the Movement of
the Landless, a peasant group. If Brazil were to completely
privatize its electricity sector, he said, it would be
``transformed into a gigantic, Portuguese-speaking Puerto Rico,''
so his group ``is in total solidarity with Itamar.''

 &HT;    Saints awaiting Williams dividends
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Ricky Williams signed with New Orleans, he and
his agent were ridiculed for allowing the Saints to hustle them.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year, $16.2 million deal was criticized because it
doesn't include voidable years and because more than half of an
$8.84 million signing bonus is deferred until next year. But the
biggest complaint was that the contract was based on performance,
rather than potential.
</P>
<P>
   For the Heisman Trophy winner from Texas to earn the usual
compensation of other high draft choices, Williams will have to net
some of the contract's $52.2 million in incentive clauses, most of
which figure to be extremely difficult to attain.
</P>
<P>
   One incentive requires Williams, the NCAA's all-time leading
rusher, to average 1,600 yards in his first four seasons. Only two
players in NFL history have done it _ Terrell Davis and Eric
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Williams says he isn't worried about the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're incentives,'' he said. ``That means if you do well,
you'll get them. If you don't do well, you don't get them. So
there's no concerns. They're supposed to be extras. If I get them,
great. If not, I still have my (signing) bonus and salary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with the deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through three games of his rookie season, the odds already are
stacked against him. Williams, 22, has rushed for 204 yards on 53
carries, an average of 3.8 yards per attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' slow start can be attributed mostly to injuries. He
left the opener against Carolina with a sprained ankle and didn't
finish a loss at San Francisco the next week because of an elbow
injury.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's 14-10 loss at Chicago, Williams rushed for a
career-high 84 yards. He seems to lack the breakaway speed that
helped him rush for more than 6,000 yards at Texas _ his longest
run with the Saints is 19 yards _ but he is running with more
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's feeling better,'' Saints coach Mike Ditka said. ``He's
not 100 percent by any means, but he's feeling better. I thought
his performance last week was pretty courageous, and he's a good
young man. Ricky doesn't worry too much about `breakout games' or
things like that. He just loves to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams indicated this week that Leland Hardy, who negotiated
the controversial contract, no longer serves as his agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I don't think so,'' Williams said, when asked if
Hardy still represented him.
</P>
<P>
   However, Williams said he's still represented by No Limit Sports
of Baton Rouge, La., which is owned by rapper Percy Miller, a.k.a.
Master P.
</P>
<P>
   The contract and the hype surrounding Williams _ the Saints
traded their entire draft allotment to Washington to select him
fifth overall _ might be too much pressure to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything in life that's worth anything, there's
pressure,'' Ditka said. ``When you have your first baby, there's
pressure, man. You've got to earn more money. There's pressure for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a commitment that we wanted him, and once we made that
commitment we went ahead and did what we did,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter, because we were going to get bombarded by
all the experts, anyway. But the pressure's not on us. It's on him,
in the sense that he wants to be as good of a football player in
the professional ranks as he was in college.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time of editorial turmoil for prestigious scientific
publications, The Journal of the American Medical Association named
a new editor on Friday _ the first woman and the first pediatrician
in its 116-year history.
</P>
<P>
   She is Dr. Catherine DeAngelis, 59, who worked for four years as
a nurse before going to college and then medical school. Dr.
DeAngelis is now a vice dean at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore and the current editor of the AMA's journal
Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis' appointment as the 15th editor of the Journal of
the American Medical Association comes as many scientific journals
are under pressure to increase income for the professional
societies and companies that own them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis' predecessor, Dr. George Lundberg, was dismissed
last January, accused of publishing a paper on whether college
students think oral sex is ``having sex'' to influence President
Clinton's impeachment trial. The dismissal fueled a controversy
over the journal's editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Dr. Jerome Kassirer resigned as editor of The New
England Journal of Medicine in a dispute with its owner, the
Massachusetts Medical Society, over the marketing of the journal's
name as part of the society's growing publishing empire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis has a reputation as a no-nonsense editor and
administrator. At a news conference in New York on Friday, she was
asked whether she would have published the manuscript that led to
Lundberg's dismissal. She replied, simply, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she had been given any guidelines about what
articles she could publish, she replied: ``You're joking; obviously
you don't know me. Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent another embarrassing episode similar to Lundberg's
dismissal, the AMA is creating a committee to evaluate Dr.
DeAngelis' performance each year and adjudicate any clashes between
the editor and the organization's executives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis said she expected to develop a close relationship
with the committee and to consult members as ``an extra brain
trust'' on various issues, as editors often tap their editorial
boards.
</P>
<P>
   But while she said at first that she did not think such
consultations would pose a potential conflict of interest with
committee members _ who would be in a position to recommend her
continuation or dismissal _ she said in an interview later that she
might rethink her position, because she had not considered the
potential for such a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis, who has appended her own pithy comments to other
authors' papers in the pediatric journal, said she intended to
publish biting editorials in her new one.
</P>
<P>
   As a children's advocate, she said, she may publish more
scientifically acceptable articles on violence, lack of health
insurance for children, and substance abuse. Women's health may
also get more attention in her journal, she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis, who was born in Scranton, Pa., said that she had
wanted to become a doctor since the age of 4 but ``was told that
girls became nurses'' and that her family could not afford college
tuition. She worked as a nurse for a year at Columbia-Presbyterian
Hospital, where ``everyone told me that I was in the wrong
profession, and I looked at physicians making rounds and I knew I
was in the wrong profession.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to receive degrees from Wilkes College, the
University of Pittsburgh Medical School and the Harvard School of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``My background in nursing has made me a much better physician
and person,'' Dr. DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   At Johns Hopkins she was instrumental in writing and
implementing a new curriculum that emphasizes learning from
patients outside the hospital, championed recruiting more women on
the faculty and received awards for her clinical teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis has a certificate in the business of medicine from
Johns Hopkins that should be helpful in running the 11 scientific
journals that she will oversee as chief editor of the AMA's
division of scientific information and multimedia. The association
says its publications bring in $54.7 million of advertising a year,
accounting for 25 percent of the annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Income from publishing is crucial to the AMA because membership
has dropped. Thirty-four percent of doctors in the United States
are AMA members, down from 45 percent in 1988, the Chicago-based
organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Membership has fallen in part because the AMA was severely
criticized for endorsing home health products that it had not
tested, in a deal with Sunbeam. The AMA has paid $10 million in a
settlement for breach of contract.

<P>
   ALHAMBRA, Calif. _ It comes barreling up from the harbor at Long
Beach, six lanes across and filled with cars, then stops short at a
big berm of earth that looks like an abandoned jump for Evel
Knievel. For 34 years, the 710 freeway has gone so far and no
farther, and traffic has poured off it onto the streets of this San
Gabriel Valley suburb in a singular brand of Southern California
frustration: a daily bottleneck of rush-hour smog, congestion and
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   For much of that time, plans to extend the road's northern end
to tie in with the area's freeway web have been blocked by South
Pasadena, the city to the north, whose residents fear that the
freeway's final 4.5 miles would despoil historic neighborhoods of
Craftsman-style houses, increase traffic and generally ruin life in
one of the oldest and most picturesque remaining enclaves in
greater Los Angeles. Last year, over the objections of opponents,
the federal government gave final approval to build the $1.4
billion project, which at a cost of some $311 million a mile would
be among the handful of most expensive highways ever built.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, opponents won an injunction in U.S. District
Court ordering a halt to further construction or land acquisition,
pending a full review of the case, and the judge ruled that state
and federal transportation planners had failed to consider less
disruptive alternatives, like improving traffic flow on adjoining
streets. So Alhambra, which wants the new road to ease gridlock and
foster growth, declared guerrilla war, at first blocking some
intersections, then re-timing traffic lights to slow the flow of
vehicles onto its streets and persuade angry commuters to put the
blame on South Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, the fight over this freeway is a timeless,
parochial conflict. The presiding judge in the case is the son of
the federal judge who presided over the last big freeway fight in
Los Angeles. But in a broader sense, the battle of Interstate 710
is an example of the biggest question bedeviling a region that is
again expanding explosively after a deep recession: How to
accommodate growth in Southern California without destroying the
quality of life that drew masses of Americans here in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   When the road was planned, the consensus answer was more and
better freeways. But the 710 stalemate has lasted so long that the
ground has literally shifted beneath it, and a political
establishment that once supported it is now highly skeptical, if
not outright opposed. Whether the new road winds up being built or
not, the controversy may be the last of its kind here, because
there is simply no more room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is, `Is L.A. going to grow up and face the
future?''' said Alan Maltun, a public relations consultant in South
Pasadena and a longtime freeway opponent. ``History's shown that
we've continued to delude ourselves up to now and everybody's
chasing a lifestyle that was evolved in the '40s and '50s that the
transportation infrastructure can no longer support, given the
population. The real question is whether public leadership is going
to finally draw the line and say, look, as much as we have screwed
up mass transportation here, we can't abandon that goal. There's
just no way you can build enough freeways.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans,
says the freeway extension would take 100,000 vehicles a day from
city streets, prevent 610 accidents and 7 deaths a year, reduce air
pollution, conserve fuel and create jobs, as a final north-south
link between two major east-west roads, the San Bernardino Freeway,
Interstate 10, and the Foothill Freeway, Interstate 210. Opponents
sharply dispute many of those assertions.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides agree that the road would be filled to capacity
at rush hour the minute it opens, and would probably let commuters
travel no more than 1.5 miles per hour faster at rush hour. At the
time that some cities, from San Francisco to Boston, have decided
to tear down or bury old freeways, not build new ones,
transportation experts here say that just because the 710 has been
on the drawing board for decades, supported by influential
construction unions and bureaucratic inertia, is no reason to build
it if it is no longer practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time, the trend was to sacrifice communities in
the name of circulation,'' said Gloria Ohland, Southern California
project manager for the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a
national coalition of organizations dedicated to transportation
policies that protect the environment and promote livable
communities, and which favors experimenting with wide streets, long
light cycles, bus and bike lanes and the like. ``We have sacrificed
so much of this city to highways and moving cars, and there aren't
that many great neighborhoods left, and the ones that are should be
preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Alhambra do not dispute that goal. They just talk
about how the lack of a freeway hurts their town. They complain
that the intersection of Valley Boulevard, the east-west street
that leads off the existing freeway terminus, and Freemont Avenue,
the north-south street that leads up to Pasadena, is one of the 10
busiest intersections in Los Angeles County. ``Basically, Freemont
Avenue is the default 710 freeway,'' said the city's transportation
analyst, Mike Holmes, whose engineers reduced the rush-hour
green-light cycle on eastbound Valley Boulevard at Freemont to 27
seconds, from 90, in July in an effort to slow the flow. ``We get
all these accidental tourists that are forced to come through
Alhambra because the freeway's not done. They don't want to come
through. They have to. South Pasadena talks about cutting their
city in half, cutting down trees. They never talk about the daily
impacts on Alhambra.''
</P>
<P>
   But after initial howls of protest and half-hour backups this
summer, many commuters have apparently found alternate routes,
Holmes said, and conditions are better. Freeway opponents say that
proves their point that the new route is not badly needed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Over the long years, transportation planners have made numerous
concessions to freeway opponents, agreeing to move or rebuild some
historic houses, ban trucks from the new section of road, and
abandon plans for an interchange with the existing 110 Pasadena
Freeway, the region's oldest and a national protoype, opened in
1940. Such an interchange would have forced demolition of even more
homes than the nearly 1,000 that would still be taken.
</P>
<P>
   But planners consistently rejected an earlier South Pasadena
proposal to route the road along the city's western border with Los
Angeles proper, and it would still slice South Pasadena, a city of
3.5 square miles and 24,000 people, almost precisely in half.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a lot of money to be spent on something that's
not needed,'' said Joanne Nuckols, an interior designer who has
lived for 30 years about two blocks from the proposed route and has
long been among the group of local homeowners, many of them women,
who have organized to fight the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have actually been going quite well for us in court
lately, and my friend said, ``Oh my God, what will we do if we win?
We won't have an excuse not to clean house anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In granting the injunction against further construction this
summer, Judge Dean D. Pregerson of U.S. District Court ruled that
state and federal officials had failed to adequately consider
surface street alternatives, and that the plaintiffs had ``shown a
probability of success on the merits'' of that claim. The next
status conference in the case is scheduled for February. A trial
would be a year or two off. Opponents hope that will gain time to
build support for other longstanding transportation projects, like
a light rail line from downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena that has
been beleaguered by delays and disputes over financing. A spokesman
for Caltrans, Margie Tiritilli, noting that the project was still
in court, said only that the agency ``continues to meet'' with the
affected cities and state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the road would run through Pasadena itself, and part
through a gritty East Los Angeles neighborhood called El Sereno,
whose mostly poor and minority residents have also objected to the
project in a separate lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the local officials _ a new generation not involved in
the original planning _ are cool to the project, or oppose it
outright, including the State Assembly speaker, Antonio R.
Villaraigosa, and the area's Republican congressman, Rep. James E.
Rogan and his Democratic challenger, State Sen. Adam B. Schiff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's got to be a political decision, and I think
that bodes well for a consensus resolution that is going to improve
traffic in the corridor without a freeway,'' said Antonio Rossmann,
the lawyer for South Pasadena. ``The fact is, the politicians are
out there ahead of the engineers and bureaucrats. You can't build
your way out of congestion. If you build it, they will come.''

SUPREME COURT IS UNLIKELY TO ACT ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the justices
talked about a lot of things that seemed to be wrong with the
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia lamented the time candidates must spend
on raising money. He also complained that the perception of
corruption in politics had not diminished since Congress set limits
on contributions in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist complained that unions got away
with more than business did. Justice David Souter said he shared
the view held by ``most people'' that ``someone who makes an
extraordinarily large contribution is going to get some kind of
extraordinary return for it.'' Justice Stephen Breyer spoke of big
contributors' ``owning'' candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But when the hour of argument was over, the nine justices
collectively left no impression that they meant to do much about
these problems. That may be just as well, considering how the court
mucked up a presidential election the last time it got in the
middle of one. In January 1976, in Buckley vs. Valeo, the court
ruled that the Federal Election Commission was improperly
constituted and gave Congress an implausibly brief 30 days to fix
things.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was repaired and the commission was reconstituted
in late May, most Democratic candidates had been starved of federal
matching money for two months. By then, Jimmy Carter, whose banker
friends lent him money on the assumption that the matching money
would ultimately be paid, had wrapped up the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Helping Carter, for good or ill, was far from the most important
thing the Buckley decision did. Concluding that campaign spending
amounted to free speech, the court held unconstitutional both the
spending limits set for federal candidates by the 1974 law ($70,000
for the House, for example) and the limits on how much wealthy
candidates could spend on their own campaigns ($50,000 for
president, $35,000 for the Senate, $25,000 for the House).
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result, spending in many contested House races will
top $2 million apiece this year as candidates spend most of their
waking hours dialing for dollars. And multimillionaire Steve Forbes
is bankrolling much of his campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Some justices would plainly like to take the logical path and
decide that restrictions on contributions impermissibly limit free
speech. Such a result might help some of the lesser-known
presidential candidates if they could find a suitable sugar daddy.
Breyer suggested that Ebenezer Scrooge might be good for $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both sides of this argument assume that there are
real contribution limits now enforced by a functional Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the commission is a paper tiger, and the limits mean
something only at the early stages of a campaign, before party
money and independent expenditures start flowing.
</P>
<P>
   As one illustration, 40 of the ``Pioneers'' who have raised
$100,000 in $1,000 chunks for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have
already moved on to the next stage, according to Common Cause, the
public-affairs lobbying organization. Through June they gave an
average of $50,000 apiece to the Republican Party, which in turn
can use it to help Bush if, in fact, he is nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Next week the Senate is scheduled to debate whether to ban these
unrestricted contributions to the political parties. The House did
approve a soft-money ban earlier this year, but there is stiff
opposition to the proposal in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Like their brethren on the Supreme Court, many members of the
House and the Senate agree that the current campaign finance system
is badly flawed. But they, too, are unlikely to do much about it.

<P>
   The energetic American economic machine may be slipping into a
slower gear, as job creation came to a halt last month and the work
force shrank for the first time since January 1996. But wages
continued to rise at a healthy pace, the Labor Department reported
Friday, keeping alive the potential for future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd, disrupting East Coast commerce in
mid-September, discouraged many employers from hiring. ``But
employment growth was weak even in those industries unaffected by
the hurricane,'' Katherine Abraham, commissioner of the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in a message to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Taking August and September together, only 95,000 new jobs were
created: 103,000 in August and then a loss of 8,000 in September.
That is a rather startling pullback from the 654,000 new jobs that
appeared in June and July _ and hardly justification for the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting,
on Nov. 16, to contain inflation by slowing the economy. When they
met last Tuesday, the Fed policy-makers left rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American economy is slowing. The key question is how
much,'' said Nancy Lazar, a vice president at ISI Group, taking a
more pessimistic view of the September employment report than some
other Wall Street economists, who said more data was needed before
a trend could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   While the Labor Department's monthly survey of American
companies revealed the weak job growth, a separate survey of
households showed that the unemployment rate in September had
remained unchanged, at an unusually low 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bond market traders, uncertain whether to view the weak
employment report as a harbinger or an anomaly, left interest rates
unchanged. The stock market initially saw in the numbers evidence
that the Fed was unlikely to raise interest rates in November. In
response, the Dow Jones industrial average rose at the opening.
Then it fell, but finally finished up 112.71 points at 10,649.76.
</P>
<P>
   ``This number, which was expected to be a defining number for
the markets, only creates more confusion,'' Joel Naroff, an
economic consultant, advised his clients in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The one aspect of the employment report that raised warning
flags was the wage number. Average hourly wages for production
workers below the rank of supervisor rose by 7 cents, to $13.37.
The 7 cents represented the biggest one- month jump in more than a
decade. But that was the only superlative. The percentage increase
_ .5 percent _ was no greater than in some earlier months this
year. And the 3.8 percent wage rise over the last 12 months is
roughly what wage growth for production workers has been all year:
firm but not yet firm enough to push employers into inflationar
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that would make the wage growth potentially
inflationary _and this is a big if _ is if productivity were to
slow from its present strong growth rate,'' said Lawrence Katz, a
Harvard University labor economist. A rising productivity rate has
meant that workers have produced more each hour on the job. The
added revenue from their output has paid, in effect, for their wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Lazar saw in the employment report was evidence that
rising interest rates in recent months, as well as a flat stock
market, rising oil prices and a sharp drop in the number of
households refinancing mortgages, are beginning to take their toll
on the real economy. But the September employment report is the
first significant evidence of that toll. Elsewhere in the economy,
retail sales were strong in September, and so were industrial
production, home sales, consumer borrowing and auto sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in 2000 we expect the economy to slow,'' said Martin
Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisers. ``But except for this report there is no other sign of
slowing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking an unusual step, the Labor Department estimated how many
additional jobs would have been counted if Hurricane Floyd had not
struck the week of the department's employment survey. The goal: To
head off speculation that September would have been a strong
employment month if not for Floyd. Without the hurricane, job
growth would have been only 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Including that 50,000, you can say that employment growth in
the third quarter was 175,000 a month compared with 210,000 a month
in the first half of the year,'' said Thomas Nardone, an official
at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``That is still slower growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs disappeared in manufacturing, retailing, mortgage banking
and government. Employment remained unchanged in finance, insurance
and real estate. Jobs in the huge service sector _ office workers,
for example, and call center operators _ multiplied, as usual, but
only by 39,000, less than half the average monthly growth of the
last year. Trucking, the airline industry, construction and public
utilities also added jobs. Between the gains and the losses, the
total number of jobs in the nation declined in September to 128.91
million.
</P>
<P>
   While industrial production rose last month, manufacturing
employment fell once again, this time by 21,000 jobs. Over the last
18 months, manufacturing employment has shrunk by 532,000 jobs, to
18.4 million. To keep production up with fewer workers, companies
have resorted to labor saving technology and equipment, as well as
overtime for the remaining people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Overtime hours averaged a relatively high 4.7 a week in
September, unchanged from August. But other industries cut back
hours, and the net result for the private sector as a whole was a
slight decline in the average workweek, to 34.4 hours from 34.5 in
August.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime in manufacturing helps to explain the steady rise
in average hourly wages for production workers. Many of the people
displaced from these jobs, on the other hand, have probably moved
into lower-paying service jobs, economists say, helping to dampen
wage growth.
</P>
<P>
   In its monthly wage calculations, the Labor Department counts
only production workers, mainly in manufacturing, and not the wages
of nonproduction service workers. Nor does it include bonus
payments, which have been widespread across the labor force, but
are easier than wages to scale back when business declines.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing labor costs more broadly, Chris Varvares, a partner at
Macroeconomic Advisers, noted that total compensation per hour _
wages and benefits _ grew by 5.1 percent in the second quarter.
``Our forecast,'' he said, ``is that compensation will rise by more
than 4.5 percent in the third quarter, still high but not as
high.''

PAUL PETZOLDT, INNOVATOR IN ROCK CLIMBING, IS DEAD AT 91 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)  (ko) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Petzoldt, a pioneer of American mountaineering and a
wilderness educator who founded the National Outdoor Leadership
School, died on Wednesday in Topsham, Maine. He was 91 and lived in
nearby South Casco, Me.
</P>
<P>
   A rugged individualist who influenced climbing in the United
States for much of the 20th century, Petzoldt said leadership and
judgment could be taught with more technical outdoor skills. In
later years, he became a voice for preserving the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kiesow Petzoldt was born in Creston, Iowa, on Jan. 16,
1908, the last of nine children. He grew up on a farm in southern
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   He was 16 when he set out in cowboy boots with a friend to scale
the Grand Teton, a majestic peak 13,766 feet high in northwestern
Wyoming that has become a mecca for rock climbers. ``We did
everything wrong,'' Petzoldt said, but the ascent established him
as a prodigy and planted the seeds of his later interest in
creating an outdoor program that stressed safety and preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   When he found that tourists in Grand Teton National Park would
pay to go up into its mountains, Petzoldt started a guide service,
one of the first in the country. He climbed the Grand Teton more
than 300 times, until he was well into his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Petzoldt attended the Universities of Idaho, Wyoming and Utah
from 1929 to 1932 but did not earn a degree. Yet he loved to teach,
even as a guide. He developed a system of voice signals that
mountaineers still use and innovative techniques for moving over
snow.
</P>
<P>
   When Petzoldt visited the Alps in 1934, he traversed the
Matterhorn and then retraced his route over the 14,701-foot-high
summit, on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Petzoldt was invited to join an American team
reconnoitering a route up K-2, the world's second-highest mountain,
at 28,250 feet, in Pakistan's Karakoram range.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no real expedition experience but he was a darned good
climber,'' recalled Petzoldt's teammate Robert H. Bates, who is the
honorary president of the American Alpine Club, which Petzoldt
later joined.
</P>
<P>
   Running short of food, the team chose Petzoldt to rope up with
its leader, Charles S. Houston, for a last push. Swapping leads
with Houston, Petzoldt climbed without supplementary oxygen to
26,000 feet, then a record for American alpinists.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home through India, Petzoldt got into a fracas with an
American medical missionary, who died after being knocked down.
Patricia Petzoldt, the climber's first wife, wrote in her book,
``On Top of the World,'' that Petzoldt was arrested but avoided
being jailed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, Petzoldt joined other rock climbers to rescue a
marooned parachutist who had landed atop Devil's Tower, an
865-feet-high fluted volcanic spire in Wyoming. Once they reached
the parachutist, Petzoldt proposed leading him down, while Dick
Durrance, who organized the rescue, and the other climbers
followed. They descended to find Petzoldt briefing reporters and
photographers in the glare of automobile headlights. The other
rescuers had understood that they would talk to reporters together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petzoldt later maintained that he had waited for the others
but had missed them in the dark,'' Chris Jones wrote in his book,
``Climbing in North America.'' ``Durrance believed that Petzoldt
had deliberately rushed ahead to get in front of the cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Petzoldt courted controversy. He did not apologize for profiting
from his climbing ventures, encouraging attention from the press,
flirting with women or twisting arms. Former Sen. Alan Simpson
remembered being cornered by Petzoldt when he was a Wyoming state
legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grabbed me by the arm and said, `Simpson, I'm going to talk
to you, and you're going to listen,''' Simpson recalled. ``And I
said, `That sounds fair enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, who now directs the Institute of Politics at Harvard
University, described Petzoldt as a bear of a man with ``a big
chest and big legs and big arms'' and a Falstaffian appetite for
life. ``He didn't suffer fools lightly, but he had time for
everybody,'' Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Petzoldt taught safety techniques to the
10th Mountain Division at Camp Hale, Colo. He also worked in the
Department of Agriculture sending food to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   After selling his guide service in 1955, Petzoldt tried alfalfa
farming in Wyoming and soon went broke. In 1963, he joined the
Outward Bound program in Colorado as its chief instructor. He left
in 1965 to start the National Outdoor Leadership School in Lander,
Wyo. Its mission, he said, was ``to train leaders capable of
conducting all-round wilderness programs in a safe and rewarding
manner.`
</P>
<P>
   Jane Howard later wrote in Life magazine that ``Petzoldt is to
outdoorsmen what Heloise is to housewives: an endless and bountiful
source of useful tips and hints.''
</P>
<P>
   Petzoldt's Outward Bound successor in Colorado, Jed Williamson,
said that Petzoldt became more outspoken on the environment. ``As
Paul grew in the business of outdoor education, he recognized the
need for paying attention to environmental ethics,'' said
Williamson, who is president of Sterling College in Craftsbury
Common, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50,000 students have graduated from the National
Outdoor Leadership School. They include David F. Breashears, who as
a 15-year-old could not afford the school but applied anyway.
Petzoldt gave him a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an indicator of his generosity as a person and his love
for exposing young people to the outdoors that I got to attend,''
said Breashears, who has since climbed Mount Everest four times.
</P>
<P>
   Until his stamina waned, Petzoldt tried to spend each New Year's
Eve climbing the Grand Teton, packing a bottle of champagne for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Petzoldt's first three marriages ended in divorce. He is
survived by his wife, Virginia.

CLINTON OPENS EMBASSY IN CANADA AS RELATIONS BETWEEN NEIGHBORS
REMAIN WARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Friday, for the first time, an American president
traveled to a foreign nation and inaugurated an American Embassy.
It was fitting that President Clinton broke historical protocol in
Canada, a quiet partner that trades more with the United States
than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxed outdoor ceremony, with Parliament's landmark
Victorian bell tower mirrored in the glass-and-steel face of the
new embassy, seemed to reflect the easy relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since a trade agreement was signed, trade
between the United States and Canada has doubled, now running over
$1 billion a day. In the 1990s, Canada has firmly established
itself as the largest source of imported energy for the United
States and the most popular foreign destination for American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In a joking mood on a sunny morning, Clinton cracked that Jean
Chretien, Canada's 65-year-old prime minister, was the only Western
leader ``who could still slalom on water skis with one of his
grandchildren on his shoulders.'' Noting that this was his fifth
visit to Canada as president, Clinton continued ribbing his
Canadian counterpart, saying: ``He also says if I come one more
time I have to start paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughter faded at the end of his speech, when Clinton
appeared to stray beyond his prepared text, talking about ethnic
strife ``in the land of my forebears in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they make an agreement to do it, they're like a
couple of drunks walking out of the bar for the last time,'' he
said of the on-again, off-again peace process between Protestants
and Catholics in Northern Ireland. ``When they get to the swinging
door, they turn around and go back in, and say, I just can't quite
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparks around the president's joke provided news for
reporters hard pressed to find controversy in a relationship that
Americans take for granted: the world's largest trading
relationship crossing the world's longest undefended border. In
what may also be the world's smoothest relationship, this
cross-border commerce is expected to hit $410 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than one percent of our trade is subject to trade
action,'' said Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United
States, a career diplomat who is also a nephew of the prime
minister. ``This huge trade goes so smoothly that it is
unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with this quiet, north-south trade explosion, the United
States now exports more to Canada than to all the countries of
Western Europe. More goods cross between Ontario and the United
States than are exchanged between the United States and Japan.
Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's foreign minister, said: ``We do more trade
through Windsor and Detroit than the U.S. does with Japan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Chretien was elected in 1993 on a platform of
skepticism about increasing economic integration with the United
States. Instead, he has presided over the fastest integration in
his country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade between the U.S. and Canada has doubled in 10 years _
that is quite impressive when you think that we have been doing
business for more than 200 years,'' Gordon D. Giffin, the American
ambassador here, said in an interview. During the same decade,
world trade increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This trade boom has radically opened a country that once reveled
in its northern isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Since an auto pact was signed with the United States in 1965,
the portion of Canada's economy tied to foreign trade has tripled,
hitting 42 percent now. Measuring economic dependence on foreign
trade, Canada has climbed within the Group of Seven industrial
countries to second place, after Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history Canada has strived to create a cohesion
between east and west. But now each of Canada's 10 provinces trades
more with the United States than with the rest of Canada. In July,
87 percent of Canada's exports went south to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing the Americanization of Canada, no doubt about
it,'' complained Peter S. Bleyer, executive director of the Council
of Canadians, a grass-roots nationalist group based here. ``Canada
is dramatically more integrated _ that is, dramatically more
dependent on the U.S. than we were a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since Wal-Mart opened its first Canadian
store, the American chain has become the Canada's largest retailer.
Noting this march of American franchises across Canada's suburban
landscape, Bleyer lamented: ``We are becoming more and more made in
the image of our elephant neighbor to the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the wishes of economic nationalists, Canada's speeding
economic links with the United States is eroding popular support
for such icons of sovereignty as border posts and a national
currency.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, in a poll of 1,204 Canadian adults, 52 percent said
they were ``optimistic'' about globalization, and 39 percent said
that border posts between Canada and the United States should be
torn down, allowing trade and traffic to flow freely in both
directions. In the poll, conducted by Ekos Research Associates,
only 17 percent were pessimistic about the economic impact of
integration.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in poll of 1,500 Canadians, half of respondents
predicted that the United States and Canada would have a common
currency in 10 years, 77 percent said in 20 years. In the poll,
conducted by the Angus Reid Group Inc., 37 percent said that
abolition of the Canadian dollar would be good for Canada's
economy. Over the last five years, the Canadian dollar has lost 12
percent of its value, a contraction popular with exporters but
frustrating to Canadian travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's openness is reciprocated on the other side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Americans made almost 15 million overnight visits to
Canada. Last year, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
commissioned a survey of 1,507 American adults for a ``feelings
thermometer'' about 25 countries. Respondents had the warmest
feelings for Canada (72 degrees) followed by Britain (69 degrees)
and Italy (62 degrees). Ranking in the mid-50s were Mexico,
Germany, Brazil, Japan, Israel, France and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on these good feelings, academic specialists on
U.S.-Canada relations speculate that the next step toward fuller
integration could be a customs union _a European-style relationship
with common external tariffs and free internal movement of goods
and people.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and diplomats tend to be more cautious on
forecasting the evolution of North America's economic relations in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dialogue is mostly in the press and among academics,''
Giffin said in interview, referring to talk of a North American
currency. ``I don't see it much among policy-makers in the U.S. or
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Most governmental efforts are concentrated on the mechanics of
maintaining trade relations. In the last six months, disputes over
several trade issues have been eased: restrictions on Canadian
companies advertising in foreign magazines and declining salmon
stocks in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday ``an agreement in principle'' was announced over exchange
of defense and aerospace technology. In a move that threatened
Canada's $6 billion a year military industry, the United States
threatened last April to impose a licensing system on defense
exports to Canada if Canada did not tighten its controls. Friday,
Canada promised to tighten its export control system, creating,
with the United States ``a strong North American perimeter for
defense export controls.''

   Back-to-school season is usually a bonanza for suppliers of
products like notebook paper, No. 2 pencils and crayons. But
Kleenex?
</P>
<P>
   As this year's back-to-school season winds down, Kimberly-Clark
reports that sales of its Kleenex brand facial tissue typically
increase about 17 percent for the July-to-September period. Why?
Apparently, school teachers around the country often include
Kleenex on the list of supplies that students will need to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, it's been on school lists for years,'' said
Jim Peliotes, associate marketing director for the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on that, Kimberly-Clark began promoting the
back-to-school season a few years ago. Since then, Kleenex, which
has about a 50 percent market share, has increased its share by
about 7 percentage points _ and by as much as 20 percentage points
in some markets during the back-to-school period. Traditionally,
the peak sales season for Kleenex sales is the cough-cold season
beginning in November.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Kimberly-Clark offered a ``value priced'' three-pack
of Kleenex, gave store displays to retailers and offered a special
mail-in promotion for a free gyroscope from Bill Nye, ``The Science
Guy,'' of PBS. Peliotes said the promotion helped build sales. &QL;

WARRICK WAITS AS FLORIDA STATE ADJUSTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ The coalition assembled to tout Pete
Warrick's candidacy for the Heisman Trophy has been reduced to a
whimper overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Heisman coalition, as the campus group
calls itself, still plans to distribute more than 10,000 T-shirts
with the slogan ``(NU)9 in '99'' on them for Florida State's annual
war with the Miami Hurricanes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There is one pesky problem. Warrick will watch the game in
street clothes. He was suspended from the team after being charged
on Thursday with grand theft. Laveranues Coles, a fellow wide
receiver, was also charged with grand theft, but was kicked off the
team because of previous legal and academic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The two players are accused of buying clothes at a local
department store worth more than $400 and paying $21.40.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's absence in particular could be telltale as FSU (5-0)
tries to maintain an unbeaten record when the Seminoles face Miami
(2-2).
</P>
<P>
   Other top games Saturday include Michigan at Michigan State,
Penn State at Iowa and Georgia at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, from Bradenton, Fla., turned down a multimillion-dollar
deal from the National Football League to return for his senior
season. He has been everything the Seminoles dreamed about, scoring
seven touchdowns, throwing for one score and averaging 101.6
receiving yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bowden, the FSU receivers coach, said there was no sense
trying to sugarcoat Warrick's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete is a guy who can win a game for you on one play,'' Bowden
said. ``There was a certain confidence factor of knowing that you
had that go-to guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As singularly explosive as Warrick has been, and even though
some think the Hurricanes have been reduced to a mere tropical
depression, Miami's players seem to genuinely regret that he will
not play Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go out and tackle people, anyway,'' defensive tackle
Matt Sweeney said. ``Heck, it might as well be a Heisman
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Bubba Franks said he had been rooting for Warrick to
be eligible Saturday, ``so nobody will have any excuses after we
win.'''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Al Blades said: ``I want their best talent out
there. I don't want any excuses about this and that. Just like we
can't have any excuses. I feel we can play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Warrick, the Seminoles scrapped several plays
specifically designed to use his special skills, such as a pass off
a wide receiver reverse. But the Seminole coaches are more
concerned about what emotional damage, if any, this sobering
development might do to their hopes for a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Overton, in charge of FSU's life skills program, part of the
school's academic support for its athletes, said she met with a
wide receiver Friday who viewed the charge against Warrick as
somewhat overblown and harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you think they made too much out of it?'' she responded to
him. ``Look, what you do on Saturdays is play a little throw and
catch, but there are always 83,000 people who think it's great. But
can you see that some people might think what you do is overblown
or given an exaggerated importance, just the way you think this
case is? I wanted him to get a little better perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hart, FSU's athletics director, who said on Thursday that
athletic talent did not put a person above the law, held out hope
Friday that Warrick would still be able to salvage his senior
season. Hart gave one disclaimer: if the charges against Warrick
remain a third-degree felony, he said, Warrick will likely not play
again for FSU.

AT&AMP;T BENEFITS AS FCC EASES CURBS ON OWNERSHIP IN CABLE TV
INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Friday
decided to substantially loosen the rules that keep one company
from controlling too much of the cable television industry. The new
rules clear the way for AT&AMP;T to own more than a third of the
nation's franchises offering subscriber television, telephone and
high-speed Internet services as well as own major interests in a
number of major video producers and television programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the wake of a wave of huge telecommunications mergers,
the decision lays down the second important policy marker of the
week _ that the federal government is willing to tolerate heavy
concentration in one industry, like cable television, if it holds
the promise of offering competition in another, like local
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of promoting local service outside their areas, the
FCC on Wednesday approved the proposed $72 billion merger of two
regional telephone companies. That ruling permitted SBC
Communications Inc. and Ameritech Corp. to form the largest Bell
operating company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote, coming just two months after the FCC relaxed the
ownership rules for broadcasters, sets a framework to permit AT&AMP;T
to become the nation's largest cable operator by completing its $58
billion purchase of the MediaOne Group. The old rules would have
required AT&AMP;T to make significant divestitures, while the new rules
may force, at most, some limited sales. But the commission, which
has been bombarded by AT&AMP;T lobbyists and executives in recent weeks
pleading for a relaxation of the rules, practically invited the
company to seek waivers for some of the few remaining restrictions
on its deal.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what impact the new rules will have on consumers,
prices and quality of service is a matter of dispute. FCC and AT&AMP;T
officials said it would lead to greater competition in local
markets, and thus lower prices, as well as faster development of
high-speed Internet service. But consumer groups, which had argued
for tougher rules, said it would result in more concentration of
cable properties, robbing cable subscribers of what little
competition already exists, and could ultimately lead to higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 5-0, with two commissioners partially dissenting,
the FCC redefined the rules and relevant markets in a way that may
ultimately make it possible for AT&AMP;T to offer local telephone
service to more than 40 percent of the nation's homes. Although the
current 30 percent cap was technically not changed, the revisions
to the definitions of markets and cable ownership effectively raise
the ownership cap for cable television to the rough equivalent of
36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also changed the rules to enable AT&AMP;T, after some
corporate restructuring, to maintain other properties it gets from
the MediaOne acquisition that produce broadcast programming,
including its 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner's cable systems,
its HBO network, and its Warner Brothers film studio. But AT&AMP;T will
now have to present a plan to the FCC. demonstrating that
programming decisions are sufficiently insulated from the cable
transmission operations.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard said the rules were reworked in an
effort to balance the 1992 cable law, which was intended to reduce
ties between cable companies and programmers, and the 1996
Telecommunications Act, which instructed the FCC to take steps to
encourage the development of high-speed Internet access and foster
competition in local telephone markets. Rapid advances in
technology have enabled the companies that AT&AMP;T has been rapidly
acquiring to offer all these services through an upgraded cable
wire.
</P>
<P>
   The laws, Kennard said, failed to fully appreciate how quickly
technology was changing the marketplace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If big cable companies wanted to consolidate just to dominate
cable broadcasting, everyone would find that troubling,'' Kennard
said at the hearing. ``But if the cable companies want to enter
into arrangements to provide for new competitive ventures, like
local phone service and high-speed Internet access, that's a
different thing altogether. Not only would it not be a threat to
competition, it could actually be a boon to competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later Friday, Kennard expanded on his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this week means is that the telecommunications industry
is restructuring before our eyes. It will never be the same and we
cannot pretend that the changes will not have an enormous impact,''
he said. ``Although we typically cast a weary eye toward
consolidation, we have to think about how it can benefit
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups called the new rules a sop to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is intellectually dishonest,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a Washington
group that promotes consumer rights and diversity of the airwaves.
``The same FCC that decried legal fictions and artificial legal
constructs in August in taking the loopholes out of the broadcast
ownership rules has created an even greater set of legal fictions
and loopholes in the cable ownership rules.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The script for today was written in Basking Ridge, N.J.,'' he
added, referring to the location of AT&AMP;T's corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzman and other consumer advocates said today's decision
is certain to prompt related industries, like broadcasting, to
return to the FCC to seek a relaxation of their concentration
rules. Viacom Inc., whose $37 billion purchase of CBS exceeds the
broadcast ownership limits, has already said it will seek to have
those rules changed so it would not have to sell any properties to
complete that deal.
</P>
<P>
   While the enforcement of the rules was stayed by the FCC until
the completion of a lawsuit that has challenged the
constitutionality of the old rules, AT&AMP;T executives Friday said
they were generally pleased with the new rules but that the FCC
should have gone further to reduce the concentration rules, which
would enable the company to continue on its buying spree. AT&AMP;T
chairman C. Michael Armstrong said at a news conference that he
hopes to be able to offer local telephone service through AT&AMP;T's
cable network to roughly half the nation, about 50 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new cap permits us to proceed with the MediaOne deal,''
Armstrong said. ``In the absence of the ruling there had been a
great deal of uncertainty and doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Two commissioners dissented in part from Friday's ruling. Gloria
Tristani, often a close ally of Kennard, said the FCC had gone too
far in relaxing the rules. On the other end of the spectrum, Harold
Furchtcott-Roth said the FCC should have relaxed the rules even
further.

CANYON (Phoenix) - An amendment that environmentalists say would
gut all noise restrictions on air tours over Grand Canyon National
Park passed the Senate this week. Ironically, the amendment was
sponsored by Arizona Sen. John McCain, who stakes his environmental
record on protecting Grand Canyon National Park and was the
architect of flight restrictions passed in 1987. The amendment, if
it becomes law, would eliminate recently proposed caps on the
number of air-tour flights over the canyon, eliminate the number of
aircraft that may fly over the park and eliminate a curfew on
flights during sunrise and sunset. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will

PROFESSOR OPRAH, PREACHING WHAT SHE PRACTICES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Ga., Ky., Tenn.)  (af) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ At Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate
School of Management here, course registration is a study in
perfect competition. To select courses, MBA students bid against
one another. Each starts with the same number of points; courses
with popular professors cost more.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding this fall was especially nerve-wracking for Walter
D. Scott, a professor of management. On Monday nights, he teaches a
course in leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday night class in leadership is taught by Oprah
Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit concerned over the summer, to say the
least, that I would end up with no students,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students bid 2,800 points _ out of 3,000 points for the
entire year _ to win one of the 110 seats in Ms. Winfrey's course,
``Dynamics of Leadership.'' For the rest of the school year, they
were willing to take a seat wherever they could find one.
</P>
<P>
   When Northwestern announced in May that it had hired a talk show
host as a part-time professor, for at least this one-term
experiment, faculty members began receiving derisive e-mails from
peers at other B-schools. Would the students sit in warm baths,
surrounded by candles? Would a blackboard chart of positive
externalities involve weight loss?
</P>
<P>
   Doubts among the Kellogg professors deepened. ``The initial
reaction from everyone was, `Huh? What's all that about?' '' Scott
said. ``There was a genuine concern that the sensationalization may
not be good for the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The dean, Donald P. Jacobs, assured them that he had hired Ms.
Winfrey, despite her lack of scholarly credentials, because of her
entrepreneurial ones. (She has a degree in speech communications
and theater from Tennessee State University.) Through the Chicago
offices of her Harpo Entertainment Group, she is involved in
television, film, video, publishing, philanthropy, the Internet,
education and health and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are a magazine and cable channel for women. She
ranks 348th on the Forbes magazine list of the wealthiest
Americans, with an estimated net worth of $725 million. She is the
highest ranking woman who didn't inherit at least part of her
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern's B-school is ranked among the top three by
Business Week and U.S. News &AMP; World Report, although its own
professors are known for teaching marketing more than
entrepreneurship. So who better to add to the faculty?
</P>
<P>
   ``Students get the best woman in business, and the best
entrepreneurial female in the world,'' said Richard P. Honack, an
assistant dean and associate professor of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   As an elective, her course is open only to second-year students.
Even those who were betting on the new professor weren't sure what
to expect. ``Part of it was just the allure of Oprah,'' said Susan
Moseley, 28, of Atlanta, in the class of 2000. ``I think everybody
expects that this is not going to be your basic business school
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, gamely played down celebrity's allure. ``I
wouldn't ever have taken the course because Professor Winfrey is
teaching it,'' said Jeff Jones, 26, of Louisville. ``But she has
interacted with great leaders from all fields.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of class, Ms. Moseley and Jones had to show
their IDs to pass through security. No cameras or tape recorders
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little nervous about it,'' Ms. Winfrey told reporters
gathered outside. ``I was doing my homework last night.''
</P>
<P>
   In the classroom, Ms. Winfrey quickly involved students in a
discussion, asking each for a synonym for leadership. She let the
students make her point: Everyone has a different idea of a leader.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing the course's theme of ``personal leadership,'' Ms.
Winfrey pounded two words in the opening class: intention and
authentic. She described how her success came from setting goals
and focusing on achieving them. And she described the value of
having an authentic leadership style that matched one's
personality. Leaders, she said, must look inward, admit mistakes
and recognize their weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``She is funny, down to earth, extremely charismatic,'' said Ms.
Moseley, who has worked in nonprofit marketing and for Intel.
``There was a lot of great discussion, a lot of participation, a
high level of energy and people were excited to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who came to Kellogg from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis, found her the opposite of a haughty entertainment star. ``I
think the thing that impressed me the most was how personable she
was,'' he said. ``You would have never known what she did or who
she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey's boyfriend, Stedman Graham _ the co-teacher, as
though anyone noticed _ is a sports marketing executive, author and
regular Northwestern lecturer. He leads students through the cases,
while Ms. Winfrey speaks more from personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Students said she hasn't just poured out random war stories, as
visiting lecturers are prone to do, but has offered anecdotes and
observations to match the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, Oprah's role is one of motivation, as an
example of somebody who came from extremely humble beginnings and
has built an empire,'' Ms. Moseley said. ``It's easier to believe
in my possibilities when I'm hearing it from somebody who's built
an amazing career from nothing but charisma and hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Students were warned not to share the class syllabus or
materials, which Ms. Winfrey said she worked on all summer, with
anyone. But the 475-page packet of readings is available for $60.50
at the campus bookstore. The cases come directly from the Harvard
Business School, but readings focus more on ``self-realization,''
``realizing intention through action'' and ``developing your travel
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The textbook is ``Principle-Centered Leadership,'' (Franklin
Covey Co., 1990) by the best-selling author Stephen R. Covey.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, as in many Kellogg courses, student teams analyze
management cases, in writing. Ms. Winfrey also requires students to
keep journals reflecting on the course and their own experiences.
Half the grade comes from a final case analysis. ``No late papers
will be accepted,'' the syllabus warns.
</P>
<P>
   When the bidding finished, the course cost students just 1,006
of their 3,000 points for the year, because each student pays only
the amount bid by the one who takes the last seat. Even that price
will fall if any students who wanted only one or two sessions with
Ms. Winfrey drop the course and others who bid fewer points take
their places.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a bargain. A science-fiction author from Dallas
spent $58,750 at a charity auction this month for the privilege of
lunch and a yoga class with Ms. Winfrey, along with two backstage
passes to her show. For $11,212 less, he could have enrolled in the
Kellogg School for a year and sat in the front row of her class
every Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   And Scott, who sneaked a peek at Ms. Winfrey's syllabus, is no
longer worried about the integrity of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me legitimate, substantive, a thoughtful course
on leadership,'' he said. He brings in distinguished executives to
expose the students to various styles of leadership, but he
recognizes that Ms. Winfrey fills that role herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is a practitioner, and this is one of those fields where
the state of the art may be more with the practitioner than with
the academic,'' he said. ``I think she brings a great deal to the
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he said, ``It's easier for me to say that now. My
class has a wait list.''

JUNK BONDS ARE QUICKLY IN A CRUNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday mornings have become a little ho-hum for Tim O'Hara at
the Golden Pear coffee shop in Bridgehampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, managing director and global head of the high-yield bond
group at Credit Suisse First Boston, regularly runs into clients
there who are picking up cups of coffee. But these days, his
clients are glum. Money is getting harder for them to borrow, they
tell him. And when they can get it, it is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life these days of leveraged-buyout financiers _
that is, the group of Wall Street investors who borrow money to buy
troubled companies with the hope of shoring them up and selling
them later for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of lenders to provide money for these deals at
reasonable rates is dwindling. And that is affecting these
financiers' ability to buy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're waiting until next year,'' O'Hara said of the clients
whose high-yield bond issues he underwrites. ``They're not anxious
to spend a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the current crunch? For most leveraged-buyout specialists,
trouble began last July when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, warned that the central bank would be willing to
put the brakes on the economy by raising interest rates and
tightening the supply of money available to borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   That sent a chill through mutual fund investors in high-yield,
or junk, bonds. They began pulling their money out of the funds
that specialize in such investments. As the pool of money to lend
contracted, interest rates on junk bonds rose two to three
percentage points, from roughly 9 percent to 11 percent to 12
percent to 14 percent, depending on the bond.
</P>
<P>
   That is making it more expensive for leveraged-buyout financiers
to borrow money. And to complicate matters, O'Hara said, some
lenders are not only demanding higher interest rates, but are also
asking for an equity stake of as much as 5 percent in smaller
companies involved in buyout deals.
</P>
<P>
   That makes borrowing money an even more expensive proposition
for the leveraged-buyout financiers, because it means sharing part
of their ultimate profit with the lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they are forced to use money of their own, instead of
borrowing it,'' said Kingman Penniman, president of KDP Investment
Advisers in Montpelier, Vt. ``They don't want to do that, or worse,
give away a big piece of the company they are trying to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   What market watchers like Penniman have seen is the widening of
the spread, or the difference between yields on high-yield bonds
and on Treasury bonds. On April 30, Penniman said, 10-year
Treasuries were yielding 5.35 percent, while an index of high-yield
bonds averaged 9.11 percent _ a spread of 3.76 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, the spread had widened by nearly a full percentage
point, to 4.67, with the high-yield index averaging 10.7 percent,
compared with 6.03 percent on 10-year Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've only seen spreads this wide for a short time, during the
Russian default and the hedge fund debacle of last year,'' Penniman
said. ``It's way above what we've experienced historically.''
</P>
<P>
   Other concerns seem to be adding to the market nervousness,
notably the fears that Year 2000 computer glitches will cause
market disruptions that will play out detrimentally for bonds and
bond holders. The validity of those fears remains unclear, though
some lenders have warned customers that it will be difficult to
finance highly leveraged transactions near the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people talk about Y2K, I look at the equity markets and I
think, why aren't (italics)they(end italics) concerned?'' Penniman
said.
</P>
<P>
   To add to that, the default rate on junk bonds is climbing and
is now running ahead of last year's rate, further dampening
investor interest. As a result, bond investors are pouring their
money primarily into the market for higher-quality bonds that offer
more safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, smaller buyout shops will suffer the most.
Banks and other lenders have already put some of these customers on
notice. One leveraged-buyout professional, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said he got a call last week from an executive at a
large lending institution, who told him that the bank was already
winnowing its list of ``preferred'' clients. (His company was still
on the preferred list, he said.)
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, well-known and respected buyout financiers like
Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice are the least likely to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation six months ago was that you could have
lesser-known companies get things done,'' said Bill Barbe, a
partner at Clayton, Dubilier. ``But now that is not as easy.'' As a
result, Barbe added, ``what will drive the market is quality
transactions of size.''

HMOS LOBBY FOR PANEL TO HEAR PATIENTS' GRIEVANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Mich., S.D., Vt., Del., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chief lobbyist for the United States' health
maintenance organizations, alarmed at the prospect of lawsuits
against HMOs, said Friday that her group would urge Congress
instead to pass legislation allowing patients to take their
grievances to an independent panel of medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbyist, Karen Ignagni, president of the American
Association of Health Plans, said the industry would also be
willing to accept a federal law imposing financial penalties on
HMOs that flout the decisions of an outside review panel.
</P>
<P>
   This represents a shift by the industry, which until now has
opposed new federal standards for managed care. The change was
prompted by the surprising House vote in favor of ``patients'
rights'' legislation on Thursday. Nearly one-third of House
Republicans joined Democrats in passing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton insists that patients should be able to sue
health insurance plans for injuries caused by the denial of care,
and the House bill allows patients to file such lawsuits in state
courts. The Senate passed a bill to define patients' rights in
July, but it does not create any new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the industry's defeat in the House, Ms. Ignagni said
Friday that she hoped to persuade Congress to require HMOs to set
up procedures for the independent review of their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Ms. Ignagni discussed the industry's
strategy in the next stage of the legislative process. ``We will be
very aggressive in advocating external review of health plan
decisions,'' she said. ``We'd be willing to accept federal
legislation to that effect, with strong penalties for HMOs that
don't comply.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill was drafted by Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., and
John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   John Stone, a spokesman for Norwood, said Friday that ``it's a
little late'' for HMOs to lobby for an appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the industry had come forward with this idea two or three
years ago, it would have received serious attention,'' Stone said.
``After several months of debate, members of Congress have learned
about the legal immunity of HMOs. The industry, in shock and panic,
has belatedly decided to concede some territory and cut its
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major lobby, the Health Insurance Association of
America, is not ready to compromise. Charles Kahn III, president of
the association, said: ``We have never taken any public position
other than `Just say no.' We oppose legislation in this area at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said it was risky for insurance companies to indicate that
they could accept a requirement for independent review of their
decisions, because the industry's position would be just ``a
starting point for negotiations'' with Congress. In those
negotiations, Kahn said, ``it would be very difficult to get
legislation we could live with,'' because President Clinton and
many House members would insist on creating a new right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni said the HMO industry would strenuously oppose any
new right for patients to sue their health plans. And while the
industry is willing to accept some new Federal standards, she said,
it will oppose ``micromanagement'' of its day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni said she could see some advantages to uniform
national standards set by the federal government. ``We can't
continue down the road of 50 states doing their own thing,'' she
said. ``You have to strive for some regulatory uniformity.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, lawyers have filed class-action lawsuits
against Aetna and Humana, alleging that they deceived consumers and
maximized their profits by degrading the quality of health care.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said these lawsuits offered a preview of what to expect
under the House bill. ``Predatory attorneys would swoop in like a
bunch of buzzards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Friday that the negotiations between the House
and the Senate would be very difficult. The two chambers have big
differences on specific provisions of the ``patients' bill of
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, for example, guarantees access to medical
specialists whenever it is medically necessary. The Senate bill
provides access to specialists only ``when such care is covered
under the plan.'' Democrats say this could render the protection
meaningless.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, said
``We are ecstatic'' with the House vote on patients' rights. ``I
would hope that we could complete the conference and come back with
a good bill before the end of this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republican leaders said they had other priorities and
would not rush to complete work on such complex legislation. An
aide to Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority
leader, said the House-Senate negotiations would follow ``the
normal pace of Congress, the normal rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference committee will probably not begin serious work
until early next year, the Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said such delay would work to their advantage,
injecting the issue of ``patients' rights'' into the middle of next
year's election campaign season. Thursday's lopsided vote in favor
of patients' rights confirms the political potency of the issue,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   James Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, said that Democratic candidates would use the
issue against three Republican senators who supported a limited
version of patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The three Republicans, James Jeffords of Vermont, William Roth
of Delaware and Bill Frist of Tennessee, are all running for
re-election. Each of them played a prominent role in the Senate
debate on patients' rights in July.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords and Roth are chairmen of the committees that wrote the
Senate bill, and they beat back many Democratic efforts to expand
the definition of patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Frist, a heart surgeon, was particularly helpful to the
Republicans because he spoke as a medical authority. But Jordan
said Frist's position was contrary to that of consumer groups and
the American Medical Association, which favored more extensive
rights for patients.

</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: WHITE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 45 to 54, a bill to nominate
Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to be a federal district
court judge. White, who had been tapped by President Clinton for
the position, is the first black judge on Missouri's state supreme
court. Supporters said White was fit for the nomination. Opponents
said White was not sufficiently favorable of the death penalty. A
``yes'' vote favors the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: AID
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 51 to 49, a $12.6 billion
foreign aid bill that President Clinton has threatened to veto
because it cuts $1.9 billion from his request. Supporters said the
amount of aid was sufficient. Opponents said the bill fails to fund
many important foreign aid programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AG
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 1, the House passed, 240 to 175, a $69 billion
agriculture spending bill. The bill would provide $8.7 billion in
emergency funds for farmers reeling from bad weather and low
prices. Supporters said the bill should have provided more
emergency aid for farmers and that it failed to address
milk-pricing and trade sanctions issues. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OPERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 214 to 211, a $12.6 billion foreign
aid bill that President Clinton has threatened to veto because it
cuts $1.9 billion from his request. Supporters said the bill meets
foreign aid spending needs without dipping into Social Security
funds. Opponents said the bill fails to allot funds for the
implementation of the 1998 Wye River Middle East peace accords and
omits restrictions on aid to pro-abortion groups situated abroad. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: TAX-BREAK
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 227 to 205, a bill to allow
citizens to create tax-free savings accounts to cover their medical
costs. The bill would also give tax breaks to those who buy their
own insurance and helps small businesses join together to buy less
expensive coverage. Supporters said the bill would help the 44
million uninsured Americans gain access to health coverage.
Opponents said the bill only helps the healthy and wealthy and
fails to addresss the needs of low-income Americans. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: HMO1
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 193 to 238, a bill, endorsed by
the Republican leadership, that would expand rights of patients
when dealing with their health maintenace organizations by easing
access to emergnecy room care and specialists and allowing them to
sue their HMOs under limited circumstances. Supporters said the
bill gives patients more rights without clearing the way for an
excess of lawsuits. Opponents said the bill's liability provision
was too limited. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: HMO2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 275 to 151, a bill that gives
citizens the right to sue HMOs that refuse to deliver adequate
medical coverage. The bill also eases access to emergency room care
and experimental treatments. Supporters said the bill would help
prevent HMOs from putting costs above the needs of patients.
Opponents said the bill's liability provision was too liberal and
could lead to an excess of lawsuits against both HMOs and employers
that provide health insurance. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 &HT;    Indians perched to send Olde Towne Team home
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Olde Towne Team is about to become olde news.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, they like to call the Boston Red Sox The Olde
Towne Team and before the leaves turn colors the Red Sox already
are one defeat away from packing away the equipment before they
barely took a whiff of postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   With a two games to none lead in the American League Division
Series, the Cleveland Indians need one victory in three possible
games to eliminate the Bosox and advance to the American League
Championship Series against the New York Yankees or Texas Rangers .
</P>
<P>
   The Tribe places the baseball in the meaty right hand of
Springfield native Dave Burba this afternoon in Fenway Park for the
possible coup de grace.
</P>
<P>
   Burba, wrapped in a heavy jacket, watched his teammates dissect
the Red Sox, 11-1, in Game 2 Thursday in Jacobs Field and remembers
turning to somebody to say, ``Hey, guys, save some digits (runs)
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba faced Boston only once this year and it wasn't pleasant,
even though he struck out eight in only five innings. He gave up
four runs, six hits and four walks in a 9-4 defeat in Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, is ancient history, something that happened April
24. Burba takes a 15-9 season's record with a 4.25 earned run
average to the mound against Ramon Martinez, an older and much
less-talented brother to Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not letting anything build up in me, telling myself I have
to win,'' Burba said. ``I'm just going to relax and pitch my
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the spectre of the 37-foot high left field wall, The
Green Monster, comes into play when he pitches in Fenway, Burba
said, ``Nope, no problem. I'm looking the other way. I can't let
the thought that a little fly ball might ricochet off the wall
enter my mind or you might change your way of pitching and some
line drives may bounce off it or some long fly balls may go over
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if they tattoo the wall, at least I pitched my game,''
Burba added.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox haven't been tattooing anything. They've scored
three runs on 11 hits in two defeats and struck out 17 times.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Burba is pitching what could be the series clincher,
that, too, is something he won't permit to clutter his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep that out of my thoughts,'' he said. ``If I
start putting together a puzzle about what this game means, I put
pressure on myself, think too much. I don't need anything extra out
of the ordinary. . .just pitch the way I know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba formerly pitched the way he knows how the for the
Cincinnati Reds and was the scheduled Opening Day starter for 1998.
A mere hours before the first pitch, he was traded to Cleveland for
first baseman Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy about coming here, it was just the timing,'' he
said. ``I was rooting for the Reds and I would have been happy for
them to make the playoffs. What I always liked about the Reds is
that even though they aren't a team of big salaries, every year
they battle you and it was fun to watch what they did this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds fell one victory short of making the postseason and
Burba played a role in their shortfall. On June 13 in Cincinnati,
he beat them, 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said with a broad smile. ``That's my job.''
</P>
<P>
   His job today is to put the Red Sox out of their century-long
misery. They've lost 18 of their last 19 postseason games and
haven't won the World Series since 1918 when a pitcher named Babe
Ruth won two games, including Game 1 by 1-0 over the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Boston manager Jimy Williams, trying to invoke The Bambino's
ghost, has carried a Baby Ruth candy bar in his pocket all season
for good luck and recalls the 1916 World Series when Ruth also
pitched a winning game when the Red Sox won the World Series over
the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had room 1916 in the hotel in Cleveland,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Something amazing happened in Indian politics
in the elections that just concluded. In the large southern state
of Andhra Pradesh, the party that promised the biggest freebies
lost. And the politician who warned that there's no free lunch won.
</P>
<P>
   Congress Party candidates barnstormed with this come-on for
farmers: Vote for us and electricity will be free. Vote for us and
stop paying your bills right now.
</P>
<P>
   But Chandrababu Naidu, head of the regional Telugu Desam Party
and chief minister of the state, warned the crowds of farmers who
flocked to his rallies that free power would cost the state too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cannot be done,'' he said. ``Don't believe their words.''
Almost as a consolation prize, Naidu promised his own more modest
giveaway programs.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Naidu's party that has swept to a landslide majority
in the state house and won 29 seats in the lower house of the
national Parliament, making it the second-largest partner in the
new Hindu-nationalist-led coalition that will soon be governing
India. Naidu won a seat in the state assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The larger question for India is whether Naidu's strategy for
economic growth will catch on in other states and in the nation's
capital. It combines cutbacks in subsidies with new spending on
education and rural development and an aggressive courting of
private investment.
</P>
<P>
   Yaswant Sinha, who was finance minister in the
Hindu-nationalist-led coalition that ran the country for the last
year and a half, said in a telephone interview Friday that the new
government would move forward with a ``second generation of
economic reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   It will quickly push legislation to open the insurance industry,
now a public monopoly, to domestic and foreign investors, he said.
The hope is that the money consumers spend to buy policies will
become a large pool of long-term capital that insurance companies
will invest in power plants, ports and other big projects.
</P>
<P>
   Sinha, who does not yet know whether he will be reappointed,
also spoke of the need for greater public spending on irrigation,
electricity and agricultural research to strengthen the rural
economy where most Indians make their living.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the new government will take politically painful
steps to scale back subsidies so it can free up money for these new
public investments.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The first test of the new government's resolve is already upon
it before it has even officially been sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, just two days after the last vote had been
cast in India's month-long national elections, the government
raised the subsidized price of diesel fuel, heavily used in
farming, by 40 percent to stanch huge losses to the government
caused by the soaring price of the fuel on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
   Already, two of the coalition's allies are howling in protest.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar situation earlier this year when one of the same
allies screamed, the ruling coalition blinked. The government had
raised the subsidized prices of wheat and rice that are mostly sold
to people who are not poor. Within days, the government had rolled
back the prices to the lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   But now the coalition has a bigger majority. Even if a couple of
smaller allies quit, the government would still have a working
majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be done,'' Sinha said Friday of the diesel price
hike.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moody's Investors Service this week upgraded its outlook on
India from stable to positive because the new government with its
stronger majority will ``be able to undertake more aggressive
economic restructuring during its term of office,'' it said in a
release.
</P>
<P>
   For decades after India gained its independence in 1947, the
economy was highly centralized and controlled by the state. The
government invested heavily in massive subsidies for fertilizers,
electricity, irrigation and fuel, but neglected primary education
and public health.
</P>
<P>
   Relative to other countries in Asia that achieved high rates of
economic growth and literacy and a rapidly rising standard of
living, India lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, in the midst of a severe
balance-of-payments crisis, India began to loosen the government's
hold on the economy and allow more competition. For several years
in the mid-1990s, growth rates topped 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, the pace of economic change has
slowed and so has growth. In a country where the population of 1
billion still continues to grow rapidly, the economy must grow by
at least 7 percent just to generate enough jobs to keep pace with
the 10 million new people entering the labor force each year,
economists say.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that the same elections in which Naidu, the
state-level economic reformer, was a winner, one of the losers was
Manmohan Singh, the architect of the India's first round of
economic reforms in the 1990s. Sing lost his first bid for an
elected seat in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Singh had a distinguished career as a high level civil servant.
He has a reputation for intellect and probity. But as a Congress
Party candidate for parliament, he did not have the natural
politician's knack for salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu, on the other hand, is the consummate pitchman. Actually,
when he talked Friday in a telephone interview about how to take
painful economic steps and still succeed in politics, he spoke like
a juggler who keeps many balls in the air.
</P>
<P>
   You can't just reduce subsidies and raise tax revenues, he said.
And you can't spend all your time convincing the Bill Gateses of
the world to set up shop in your state or the World Bank to invest
its billions in your projects.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to spend money on welfare programs that people
need to survive today. You have to invest in development programs
that will help them make a better living from their land. And you
have to figure out ways to make sure that the money the government
already spends on the basics _ schools, clinics, roads _ goes
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to appeal to investors all over the world,'' said
Naidu. ``Here in India, everything is possible. People thought that
if you talked about economic reforms, you would not get elected.
But if you do well, people will believe you and vote for you. I
have proved that now in Andhra Pradesh.''

 &HT;    Bengals never looked this way before
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ If you've been scratching your head while trying to
remember how long it has been since the Cincinnati Bengals played
this badly, you can stop scratching _ the answer is never.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, the Bengals have lost by 27 points to
San Diego (34-7), 24 to Carolina (27-3) and 28 to St. Louis
(38-10). This is the first trifecta of 20-point defeats in the
32-year history of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   And the 20 points total scored by the offense is the second
lowest ever for a three-game stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati will be reeling heading into Sunday's game in
Cleveland. The expansionist Browns are also 0-4, but that was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to imagine they (the Browns) could look any
further off (from being a playoff contender) than we have,'' said
Cincinnati president/general manager Mike Brown. ``How could they?
I don't know of any team that's gone through what we've gone
through in the last three weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals have lost 14 of their last 15 regular season games
and coach Bruce Coslet will make at least two lineup changes for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He announced on Monday that first-round draft pick Akili Smith
will replace Jeff Blake at quarterback. Later, he decided to make a
change at free safety, moving rookie Cory Hall ahead of three-year
starter Greg Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said he hopes Hall will bring ``consistency and
production'' to the position. ``We haven't been getting it done
there, so we made a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals haven't been getting it done at a lot of positions,
said tackle Willie Anderson. ``Check individual players and
sometimes you have to think, 'Are we good enough?' I'm trying not
to be harsh, but we're looking for answers to all those questions.
Maybe that's it. Maybe we're just not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals haven't been good enough for a long time. As they
head into Cleveland, they are 48-100 in the 1990s. With seven more
losses, they will have suffered through the most losing decade in
NFL history, supplanting the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were 45-106
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if we lose to Cleveland, we'll become even more the
butt of ridicule,'' Brown said. ``While we seem to have pressed the
boundary on that, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   RIVALRY RESUMES
</P>
<P>
   After the 1990 season, the Bengals had a 22-19 advantage in the
series with Cleveland. In the next five years, the Browns won eight
of the 10 meetings, including an active streak of seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   COATS ON PRACTICE SQUAD
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals on Friday signed guard Tony Coats to the team's
practice squad. A rookie from the University of Washington, Coats
had been waived from the 53-player roster by the Bengals on
Thursday. He was a seventh-round Bengals selection in the 1999
draft, and was on the inactive list for the first four games this
season.

BEHIND THE SCENES AT THE GAP, TROUBLING STATISTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Gap Inc. losing its edge? When retailers reported September
sales on Thursday, the numbers were pretty good: an increase of 5.5
percent from a year earlier, according to the Goldman Sachs' retail
composite index. At Gap, sales rose even more than expected, 7
percent, news that nudged the stock up $1.1875 Friday, to $38.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that clutch performance, however, are some troubling
statistics. The entire 7 percent rise was powered by Gap's young
divisions, Banana Republic and Old Navy, each of which is expanding
at an explosive rate. But sales declined up to 4 percent in
September at Gap stores, which still account for roughly 35 percent
of the company's revenue. It was the sixth consecutive month that
the flagship chain had posted flat or negative sales. Gap Kids,
another division, has also been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting trouble at Gap is a dangerous game. After all, the
retailer has stumbled before and each time swiftly regrouped,
coming back stronger than ever. But the landscape for Gap has
changed significantly in the last few years. Competitors have
become much more focused and are white hot. American Eagle
Outfitters, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and The Limited, which has been
resurrected from the dead, are all making successful assaults on
the younger end of Gap's customer base.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, Old Navy, the fun, lower-cost clothier begun
by Gap a mere five years ago, has become so popular so quickly that
it is challenging Gap stores' primacy. Gap does not break out sales
numbers for each division, but retail stock analysts estimate that
Old Navy contributes a third of Gap's annual $9 billion in revenue,
as much as Gap itself.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy's connection with customers is a great retail triumph.
Still, the 1,021 stores under the flagship Gap name must start to
perform better or risk becoming dead weight. And the stock, while
down more than 25 percent from its July peak, looks rich to some
analysts unless the company can return to double-digit growth, for
which it needs the Gap stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors cannot ignore what is going on with the Gap
brands,'' said Richard Baum, who recently picked up coverage of Gap
Inc. for Credit Suisse First Boston by dropping his rating on the
stock from ``buy'' to ``hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Barnes, vice president and treasurer of Gap Inc., insists
that the current sales doldrums are little more than a blip in the
fashion cycle and mostly reflect how hard it is to beat the
double-digit growth Gap recorded in so many months last year. ``Gap
is up against tremendous performance of last year,'' he said. ``We
see this as a relatively short-term issue, and we do not have plans
for major change in long-term strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to argue with Gap's long-term strategy. Since Millard
Drexler took the helm in 1983, the company has transformed retail,
practically inventing the concept of a retailer as a brand _ as
opposed to just carrying clothing with a brand name. But Gap, which
aims to sell basic merchandise like T-shirts and blue jeans to a
very broad group of customers, is a ripe target for chains that can
tailor their presentation to a subset of those shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie and American Eagle speak with artistic precision to
college-age shoppers and the teen-agers who admire them. These two
retailers are small compared with Gap _ Abercrombie has some 200
stores with $815 million in total sales last year and American
Eagle has 400 stores with $587 million _ but each is growing at
stunning double-digit rates that clearly take a piece of Gap's
hide.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Leedy, executive vice president for marketing at
American Eagle, argues that his chain has a distinct advantage over
Gap, which is trying to be so much to so many people. ``Our store
environment is razor-sharp focused on that customer,'' he said,
pointing to details like music from the most recent Lilith rock
fair and couches for hanging out. ``I don't think that in their
environment they can present the lifestyle as well as we can,'' he
said of Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of Gap's vulnerability is already showing up among
those early arbiters of cool, teen-agers. Last year, when Teenage
Research Unlimited, a Chicago-based market research firm, surveyed
2,000 people 12 to 19 years old on cool brands, Gap was No. 5 on
the list and the only retailer in the top 10. In a survey just
completed, Gap slid to sixth, a spot it shared with Abercrombie.
And it was right behind Old Navy, which ranked fifth. Survey
respondents also offered up bits of opinion that could be
devastating to Gap in the long run. ``They think of Old Navy as the
Gap but at lower prices,'' said Michael Woods, the research firm's
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Gap vigorously denies that Old Navy is stealing
Gap's thunder. Leroy, describing internal studies of openings of
Old Navy stores in Gap markets, said: ``After the first year, the
Gap store will do better than our projections, because Old Navy has
driven more customers into the market. We have not seen anything
like cannibalization.''
</P>
<P>
   But an executive who knows Gap's management says that Drexler,
the company's chief executive and spiritual force, is redirecting
his energies. Until last year, he had been enamored mostly of Old
Navy, but he is now convinced that Gap stores need his full
attention.

BANK STOCKS AND THE JINX OF FED CREDIT TIGHTENING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rising interest rates are bad news for banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Federal Reserve starts to tighten credit
conditions, that nostrum is trotted out to explain why bank stocks
are suffering. But for the last two decades or so, the banks' big
problems have not been caused by rising rates.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Bank stocks have been suffering this year, in part
because investors have sold shares as the Fed has raised short-term
rates. After peaking in late April, a time when most folks thought
the Fed was friendly, the Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods Banks index has
fallen 15.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it may be a while before Wall Street's attitude
toward the sector sweetens. Lawrence W. Cohn, a bank stock analyst
and director of research at Ryan Beck Southeast Rearch in
Livingston, N.J., explained why last week. Here are excerpts from
that discussion: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is this perception about rising interest rates being bad
for banks misplaced? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. That universally held misconception drives bank analysts
around the bend. And it goes back to the early 1970s, when after
roughly four decades of stable interest rates, this country went
through the first of several bouts of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In the postwar context the banking industry had never had to
defend itself against that, and banks got their clocks cleaned.
Traditionally, banks had never paid attention to looking at the
sensitivity of their balance sheets to rising rates. The experience
was very painful.
</P>
<P>
   In every succeeding rate cycle since then, and there have been
five, banks have gotten increasingly sophisticated in managing
risks by doing a variety of things, from repricing assets, changing
the mix of their liabilities to inventing various kinds of
derivative instruments that allow them to shift risk to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has given the industry an ability to manage rate
risk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But doesn't that perception explain why bank stocks have come
down this year? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A rise in interest rates is a big chunk of the reason, but
not all of it. There has been a real shift in attitude about where
we are in the economic cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's problems in the capital markets, coupled with the
Long-Term Capital crisis, began a view that the cycle couldn't go
on forever. And that has led to increasing concerns about asset
quality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Economic data don't support the thesis that the expansion is
nearing an end. And isn't the Fed raising rates to cool off the
economy? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We don't see any signs the economic cycle is coming to an
end. But we have gone through this before.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1988, when the economy was quite strong, bank stocks
acted quite poorly. The issue then was worry about the end of the
cycle when nothing indicated it was here.
</P>
<P>
   At some point this cycle will end, and when the market is
worried about that, things are tough. The thing that makes this
such an extraordinarily frustrating period for people in my
profession is that the stocks stay very cheap for a long period of
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You mentioned concerns about asset quality. Are there areas
where banks are overextended? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have already seen some of the excesses in the system.
Subprime consumer lending has gone through a terrible period, as
has credit card quality. But that has been improving now for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, though, we don't see anything that would make the next
recession comparable to what the late 1980s was for the banks. When
it comes, the next recession will be sufficiently modest for the
industry that you will see a decline in earnings, but not much
else. If the market sees that modest effect, then you are finally
going to get a multiple on bank earnings that better reflects the
underlying growth of the industry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Absent a recession, can you see anything on the horizon that
would prompt investors to take a second look at the group? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A recession is the only thing that will cause the market to
reassess this situation. We had hoped that as the market saw the
better capital and reserve position of the industry, it would
recognize that banks were in better shape than during the last
recession, which for banks was the worst since the 1930s. But it
has not come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   At some point yields on these stocks will reach a point where
they start to create a floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. For the past couple of years a good number of bank stocks had
a takeover premium built into their stock price. Merger activity
has slowed this year. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The primary reason is the drop in stock prices. But it was
not possible that 1999 was going to be as active in the merger area
as 1998 was, because by any measure that was an exceptional year of
merger activity.
</P>
<P>
   Merger activity has picked up a little recently, and we still
expect a rush of activity as banks try and beat the 2001 deadline,
when pooling-of-interests accounting gets eliminated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are there any stocks you like at this point, given the
market's sour mood on the group? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We think the place to be is those kinds of companies that are
less exposed to movements in interest rates from a perception
standpoint and from a business standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to companies with big processing or money
management businesses, like Bank of New York, Northern Trust, U.S.
Trust and Mellon Bank.
</P>
<P>
   We also like companies with solid dividends and the capacity to
grow those dividends. In that area, we like People's Bank of
Connecticut, which has been growing their dividend at a 20 percent
compound annual rate for the last five years. We think they can do
that for the next several years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So people should stay away from the big money center banks? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The money centers are stocks that will have the hardest time
making progress. At some point they will get so cheap they will
drag in value investors. But they are stocks that have had
substantial asset quality problems at the end of the economic
cycle. When they move out of institutional favor, as they are now,
it is hard for them to move higher.

PEPPERY BURNS HOT UNDER THE COLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Any spectators walking into the Bruins' workout Friday
were best advised to tiptoe or duck. The Bruins are off to their
worst start since 1965-66, only the seventh time they have begun
the season 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns was arguably in the worst mood he's been in
since joining Boston some two-plus seasons ago. Burns is a master
tactician at choosing his spots to use anger, pleading, and/or
humor to illustrate his points. Friday, though, he seemed genuinely
ripping mad.
</P>
<P>
   His No. 1 goaltender, Byron Dafoe, is sitting home in a contract
dispute, he no longer has last year's top checking center, Tim
Taylor, he's lost experience and depth in other areas, and he
doesn't have a center who can consistently (or even occasionally?)
win a faceoff. Add to that the fact Burns is having to audition
more players to figure out who can play in the league and who
can't, and it's obvious why tensions are rising.
</P>
<P>
   During practice at the Ristuccia Center in suburban Wilmington,
Burns peppered his language with expletives and other toxic
language for emphasis and was no less snappish when meeting the
media. These are not happy days, and perhaps what reflects an even
darker sense of foreboding is that it isn't going to get any
easier. The Bruins face Philadelphia Saturday night at the
FleetCenter, a dangerous proposition considering the potent Flyers
have scored zero goals in two games. They host the Colorado
Avalanche Monday afternoon and then embark on a six-game West Coast
swing that is always a colossal grind.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Rob Tallas, who was victimized in the Bruins' sloppy 4-3
loss to the Senators Thursday night, said the air around the team
is more like a depression than a tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of confidence,'' said Tallas. ``When
something goes wrong, the frown on the face says a thousand words.
The expressions are unbelieveable. Bad bounces are going to go
against us, but it's a matter of how you respond to them in the
positive. Rather than going after it, we're kind of waiting for it
to happen. I recall at Christmas last year we went through a time
like this. We got out of it. It's early in the season. But there's
such a cloud over this team now. I don't know if it's the Dafoe
thing or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, who was as ornery and ill-tempered as ever seen in his
tenure in Boston, said he was somewhat encouraged by his team's
start in Ottawa. But turning a 3-1 lead into a 4-3 loss is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off much better with more grit and determination,''
said the coach. ``Everyone has got to get on the same page at the
end. We gave up some goals, took some penalties we didn't have to.
Some players have to play with emotion. We're not playing with
emotion. Skating is not good enough, there has to be emotion and
grit involved. It's tough to manufacture grit and size. It has to
come from within the heart. It's very difficult for a coach to make
a player that's not gritty into a gritty player. I think that's
their responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Anson Carter is one of those who has to improve.
Carter said he has felt a little out of the mix thus far due to the
Bruins' preponderance of righthanded shooting centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely can play better, that's for sure,'' said Carter.
``I haven't been getting the puck as much as I'd like it. All the
plays seems to be starting out on the left-wing side, and my job so
far seems to be creating space for other guys. In doing so, nothing
has been very effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make plays with the puck as well as create
openings and so far the first three games, all I'm doing is
creating openings for other guys. A lefthanded center would help.
Then, his natural tendency is to pass to the right side and that
right away gets you more involved in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns would like to see Carter bear down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anson has got to play better,'' said Burns. ``Anson is one of
those guys that I know there's grit there. Anson's grit has got to
come out. He's got to show a lot more. Skating between the blue
lines is not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Don Sweeney, who has been through winning streaks to
losing streaks to everything in between, said it has been a tough
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only positive thing is we've gotten a little better each
game,'' said Sweeney. ``That doesn't say much. Obviously we've got
some areas we need to improve upon and that's as a whole. That's
not any one person, one play. We just need to do things a little
bit better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have teams chipping the puck in on us and pursuing it and
we need to do that. When we did that last year, we were very
successful and we need to realize that. Until we do, we're not
going to be successful. We're not a fancy hockey club. We've got a
couple of guys on this team who can stickhandle with the best of
them in certain situations. Otherwise, let's bread and butter it,
let's simplify things. Let's pick up the intensity and work
ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said the Bruins' first two goals against Ottawa were
classic examples of things the team needs to do more of.
</P>
<P>
   ``That speaks volumes right there,'' he said. ``You realize
that's how it's going to get done here. I just don't think we've
played good enough to win, to tell you the truth, especially the
first two games. It's not going to (get easier). Every night is a
test. Some teams bring more speed, some bring more size. You look
at the differential at the teams in the conferences with regard to
making the playoffs, it's slim margins across the board. Points
now, I hate saying it because we're 0-3, but they're equally as
precious now as they are in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   And so far, the Bruins don't have any.

   Give the Indians credit. They have a better 25-man roster than
the Red Sox, and only two of Boston's starters, Nomar Garciaparra
and Jason Varitek, could break into the Indians' starting lineup.
Yet the Indians payroll is $4.3 million less than Boston's. Here is

year:

   President/general manager Harry Sinden on the Bruins' 0-3 start:
``We have to start thinking more offense. They talk about needing
to play defense to win in any sport, and that's OK, if you can also
score. You can't win without scoring. At some point here we have to
think more about us scoring than worrying about the others guys
scoring. You need some kind of balance.''

   Peter Warrick, the Florida State wide receiver suspended by the
team for allegedly being involved in grand theft larceny, would be
one the top three players taken in the NFL draft if it was held
today. And if no top college quarterback emerge, he could be No. 1.
Florida State plays LSU Saturday. Just before the season started,
Larry Foster, LSU's co-captain, was suspended after being arrested
for purse snatching . . . The call that took a touchdown away from
the Cleveland Browns last Sunday when they returned a Drew Bledsoe
interception was a bad one. A review of the film showed the
``holding'' was a joke and should never have been called. Much
worse than that had been going on all day, and the ``hold'' was a
one-10th of a second tug, rather than a takedown.

   The next Reggie Lewis trial has been scheduled for the first
week of April 2000 . . . On Oct. 2, 1960, on the par-3 third hole
at United Shoe in Beverly, Mass., Paul Kelly of Kelly
Communications, which has put together many sports radio deals in
Boston over the years, got his first hole-in-one. On Oct. 2, 1999,
playing another par-3 third hole, Kelly collected his second
hole-in-one. When Kelly returned home to check the ball he had used
the first time, it was a Titleist 4, red. The second one was also a
Titleist 4, red. Knowing how tight Kelly is with a buck, his
friends would say he was still using the same ball if it hadn't
been mounted.

   Notice what happens in the Miami-Indianapolis game Sunday. After
losing to Buffalo Monday night, head coach Jimmy Johnson ripped
into future Hall of Famer Dan Marino for turning the ball over four
times. Johnson said publicly that Marino had receivers open and
didn't get them the ball. TIn particular, Tony Martin had just two
catches. Reportedly, Johnson told Marino that if he throws one
interception this week, he is coming out of the game . . . Speaking
of Indy, the Colts will probably be the odd team out in the AFC
East when the new Houston franchise enters the league in 2002.
There will be eight divisions with four teams each, meaning one of
the current five in the AFC East will have to switch. Unfortunately
for Patriots fans, it figures to be Indy, which means we may not
get to see the potentially great Bledsoe-Payton Manning matchups of
the future on a yearly basis. Indy will probably be shipped to the
Central division. One team, perhaps Seattle, will be switched from
the AFC to NFC. There are only eight so-called West teams,
including St. Louis, and five are in the AFC. So one has to move .
. . Raiders owner Al Davis recommended at the NFL meetings this
week behind closed doors that the league consider eliminating all
intraconference games, setting up a Super Bowl where two teams
would not have played each other during the regular season, just
like the old AFL-NFL days. I'm all for that. There was a lot more
feeling in the early Super Bowl games when it was AFL vs. NFL.

   The BTUFF group, Boston Terriers United For Football, put some
solid hits on John Silber and members of his administration who led
the charge to get rid of football three years ago, saying it was
too costly. The BTUFF newsletter contains these quotes: AD Gary
Strickler in Jan. '99: ``We dropped football primarly because of
cost issues. It's an issue how to spend our money and I don't think
Boston University wants to, or can afford to, spend $3 million a
year on one sport.'' However, BTUFF points out that in a November
1997 story in Boston Magazine, with figures taken from an Internal
Revenue Service report, BU's total sports budget was $2.6 million.
BTUFF also lists Silber's salary as chancellor at $604,212 a year
and points out in 1996, the year it dropped football, BU took in
$36 million more than it spent. Not bad for a non-profit
institution.

   Linebacker Ted Johnson hopes to return to the Patriots' lineup
around Dec. 1, or sooner. ``I feel fine. I think what happened to
me (tearing tendons in both arms in two years) was a freak thing. I
read this stuff about being overtrained. How can anyone be
overtrained? When I come back my attitude is that what happened was
a fluke and isn't going to happen again.'' When the Patriots play
in Kansas City Sunday their top rookies, linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer Center and Damian Woody, figure to get their biggest
tests thus far. Chester McGlockton will be playing in front of
Woody from time to time. And there's only one defensive lineman in
the league who is better than McGlockton _ Tampa Bay's Warren Sapp
_ when he decides to play. And reportedly he is playing hard this
year. Katzenmoyer will be going up against KC's version of the
Bermuda Triangle in center Tim Grunhard and guards Will Shields and
Dave Szott. They've played together for years and will show whether
the Patriots are vulnerable to an inside running game as some
suspect.

   Until Terry Glenn came along, Art Graham was tied with three
others for the Patriots' record for most catches in a game. Graham
made 11 receptions Nov. 20, 1966, against Kansas City, one of the
best defensive units ever assembled and the first AFL Super Bowl
representative. What made Graham's performance even more special
was that he played with stitches in his head after being involved
in a car accident earlier in the week, and before he didn't know if
he would even be able to put his helmet on.

   The death of Rod Shoate this week was not a shock, even though
he was just 46. Shoate, who played for the Patriots in the 1970s,
abused drugs most of his adult life and had two personalities. One
moment he was a nice guy and the next a jerk. The strangest thing
of all is that Shoate wanted to be a street person. When he got in
trouble after his playing days with drugs, some of his former
teammates reached out and helped him with money and jobs, but in
the end, he wanted to go back and live on the streets, which
ultimately cost him his life . . . Here's why major league baseball
is considering buying out two teams, namely Kansas City and
Oakland. Both teams are big financial losers in small markets,
which MLB teams have been supporting to the tune of $10 million a
year. These teams also get about $14 million a year from national
television contracts. They could be bought out for $200 million,
meaning in just four years, major league baseball would have enough
to pay for both teams and cut its losses.

COMMENTARY:   PULL THE PLUG ON BROOKLYN . LET'S HAVE A REAL CULTURE
WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany)   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Count me as one First Amendment believer who hopes that Rudolph
Giuliani does shut down the Brooklyn Museum of Art as retribution
for exhibiting Chris Ofili's elephant-dung-ornamented painting
``The Holy Virgin Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor's at it, he should lobby the U.S. Senate, which
last week voted to deny federal funds to the Brooklyn Museum, to do
the same to the NEA-supported Whitney Museum, currently displaying
Andres Serrano's ``Piss Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not strongarm the New York State Council on the Arts
into ditching the Film Society of Lincoln Center? This week its
film festival screened ``Dogma,'' a movie condemned by the Catholic
League because ``God is played by a singer known for her nude
videos and songs about oral sex'' (a k a Alanis Morissette).
</P>
<P>
   If we're going to have a culture war, let's go for broke. After
two weeks of cynical posturing on all sides about the Brooklyn
Museum's show ``Sensation,'' it's beginning to seem that nothing
more important than a Senate race hangs in the balance. We take our
freedoms so much for granted that we (and that includes the city's
many cowed cultural leaders) can't imagine that anyone would
actually silence a cultural institution. Were Giuliani to evict the
Brooklyn Museum, it might at least sweep away the phony pieties of
this uproar and return us to the urgent debate that has been
obscured: the desirability (or not) of having independent, publicly
funded homes for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest, though hardly the only, cynic in the fracas so far
is the mayor. If he truly believes that what he deems
``Catholic-bashing'' is grounds for eviction, why has he not
targeted additional offenders (including the other city-funded
museums displaying art that could be construed as blasphemous)?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Brooklyn, a struggling museum in an outer
borough, is easier to bully than a Manhattan cultural mecca with a
heavy-hitting board bulging with Giuliani fat cats? Were the
mayor's real aim to police the public funding of supposedly
anti-religious culture, rather than stage an election-year stunt,
fairness would demand a consistency of enforcement, including a
sweep of public libraries stocking John Cornwell's new biography of
Pius XII, ``Hitler's Pope'' (also condemned by the Catholic League,
a self-appointed watchdog organization that in fact has no official
connection to the church).
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Museum, for its part, is not anyone's ideal martyr
to the mayor's wrath. ``Sensation'' was assembled by a private
collector, the British advertising tycoon Charles Saatchi, and much
of it is kitsch. The museum's own cynicism is evident in its vulgar
marketing campaign (almost nostalgically reminiscent of those at
the dawn of X-rated movies), its abdication of any curatorial
input, and even its camp audio tour narrated by David Bowie (who
intones of the elephant dung, ``On a damp day its rich, earthy
scent wafts elusively around [ Ofili's) works'').
</P>
<P>
   In an era of empty blockbuster repackagings of Impressionists
and a Guggenheim Museum homage to the sculptural finesse of
Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the best to be said in the Brooklyn
Museum's defense is that its craven embrace of showmanship is far
from an anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Further confusing the issues have been polemics, in the press
and elsewhere, untainted by any firsthand knowledge of the actual
exhibition. Any journalist who says that Ofili's Mary is
``smeared'' or ``covered'' or ``splattered'' with elephant dung
hasn't seen it and is misrepresenting its ambiguous tone. Ditto for
the countless ideologues who have clung to the rhetorical salvo
that the Brooklyn Museum would never exhibit a painting that
treated a venerated African-American in this way: only a few yards
from ``The Holy Virgin Mary'' in Brooklyn is another Ofili canvas,
``Afrodizzia'' which inscribes the names Cassius Clay, Miles Davis
and Diana Ross, among other black icons, on brown clumps
interchangeable with those decorating the ``Virgin Mary.'' Ofili is
nothing if not an equal-opportunity dung artist.
</P>
<P>
   Another widespread canard is that ``Sensation'' is the creation
of a liberal elite. Saatchi is in fact a conservative whose cunning
political ad campaign sped Margaret Thatcher to power.
``Sensation'' is a byproduct not of public subsidy but of the go-go
art market, which Saatchi is skilled at manipulating. An uglier
sideshow is the attempt by some to exploit the controversy by
pitting religions against each other.
</P>
<P>
   In Salon, Camille Paglia fingers ``a Jewish collector and a
Jewish museum director'' for plotting ``Sensation.'' (How did the
museum's First Amendment lawyer, Floyd Abrams, escape her?) The
Catholic League's diatribe on ``Dogma'' fixates on Harvey and Bob
Weinstein, who initially produced it (as they did the same
director's previous non-religious films). The fact remains that
Ofili is a Catholic, as are the authors of ``Dogma'' and ``Hitler's
Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   (Why do Ofili's critics mindlessly repeat Giuliani's assumption
that the artist intended to bash Catholics? He might have been
targeting Episcopalians or any other faith venerating the Virgin
Mary.)
</P>
<P>
   Out of all this heat has come scant light. One silly argument
has it that taxpayers should not have to pay for anything of which
they disapprove. Alas, that's not how democracy works. As Fran
Lebowitz succinctly said on CNN last week, ``We do not have a
line-item veto on our tax returns. . . . I pay for the sports
stadium I never go into, you pay for the art museum you never go
into.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have argued that the only way out of this mess is to
remove taxpayers' money from all cultural endeavors. If this is the
argument we want to have _ and it's a profound debate, not a silly
one _ let's have it in earnest, and with the facts.
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly a significant American cultural institution that
doesn't get some money, whether for shows or capital improvements
or exhibition insurance or education, from local, state or federal
government (or all three). The money is not vast, some of it is
misspent (as in every other sector of the government budget), but
what would happen if we eliminated it all?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For every Metropolitan Museum whose wealthy constituents might
fill the gap with donations and higher admission fees, there's
another in Brooklyn and the Bronx and most of the localities in the
nation that cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Will an end to public arts funding lead to a healthy Darwinian
winnowing out of disposable second-rate or fledgling institutions
in fly-by cities, as conservatives might argue, and if so, would
anyone care? Might completely privatized museums lead to even more
plentiful and pernicious commercial enterprises like ``Sensation''
at the expense of scholarship and permanent collections?
</P>
<P>
   We don't have a serious national cultural debate to adjudicate
such issues. More typical is what happened last weekend, when the
mayor made the TV rounds and no one even bothered to book an actual
cultural figure (such as Arthur Miller, Cynthia Ozick or Mary
Gordon, among the 100 signatories of a PEN petition protesting his
stance) to articulate an alternative viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Artists can also offer a ground-zero perspective on what happens
when government declares war on the arts. The day the mayor took on
the Brooklyn Museum, the first call I got was from Al Hirschfeld,
now 96, who immediately started recalling 1937. That was the year
the Nazis held their notorious show of ``degenerate art'' _
vilifying, in the words of its signs and labels, art that was
``sick,'' that featured ``insolent mockery of the divine'' and that
wasted ``the taxes of the German working people.'' (The art in that
show, including Jesus in a gas mask, not only drew the same
official rhetoric as ``Sensation'' but also a corresponding record
attendance.)
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1937 as well that U.S. Government guards seized the
New York theater where Orson Welles and John Houseman were staging
the Federal Theater's pro-union musical ``The Cradle Will Rock'' _
a chilling incident that Hirschfeld likened to the mayor's threats
against the Brooklyn Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the right to picket the place,'' said the artist of
Giuliani, ``but this is nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   We all have that right _ to campaign for change at any cultural
institution in any way the law allows. By arguing that a mayor's
power extends to pulling a museum's plug outright or, if that fails
in the courts, to intimidating the city's more spineless cultural
bureaucrats into silence or self-censorship by merely threatening
to do so, Giuliani takes us back to an era many New Yorkers aren't
old enough to remember.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if the mayor were to succeed in evicting the museum
_ maybe he can find a pretext in fire laws that forbid overcrowding
_ it might crystallize what's at stake to the many who are
understandably disgusted by both sides in this culture war.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle of police padlocking the Brooklyn Museum would be
dynamite performance art even by the raucous standards of the
eleven o'clock news.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore assembled his political
high command for a meeting at his residence at the Naval
Observatory last April 23, prospects for his presidential campaign
were looking good. Fund raising was on target. Polls showed him
comfortably ahead of former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Gore's advisers, noting that Bradley seemed to be
making headway with disaffected Democrats and independents, urged
the vice president to take on the challenger before he gained
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   White House pollster Mark Penn wrote in a memorandum distributed
at the meeting and reviewed by The New York Times: ``Stop the free
ride for Bradley. His favorability is growing. And we are letting
him get his message out. The campaign must attack everything he
says and does.''
</P>
<P>
   When the group reassembled May 11, there was another memo from
Penn, this one recommending that campaign officials _ not surrogate
speakers _ attack Bradley directly. The suggested theme: ``All talk
_ no leadership. Big talk _ no ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But after intense debates, Gore concluded that any mention of
Bradley would only give his rival more attention. Even Penn went
along with the consensus, according to many participants, persuaded
that Gore was safely ahead of Bradley in the horse-race polls. So
the vice president ignored Bradley for several months. Behaving as
if he were already the Democratic nominee, Gore saved his critiques
for the Republican front runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last week that Gore uttered Bradley's name and
refocused his campaign on beating back Bradley. He replaced Penn
and other advisers. And now, several people who played influential
roles in the Gore operation say the failure to engage Bradley
sooner was a fundamental misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   Several Gore advisers point to that as one of a string of
miscalculations, missed opportunities and simple misfortune that
resulted in a plight that they never anticipated: After entering
the presidential competition with the vast resources of the White
House and Democratic establishment behind him _ and more
institutional advantages than any candidate in modern times _ Gore
now finds himself in a harrowing battle for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier on, the differences between the two could have been
painted in bright lights,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of
Gore's leading supporters in Congress, ``and it would have been
much harder for Bradley to have gotten any traction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has cast himself as the ``underdog,'' a maneuver that his
aides said was designed to diminish expectations even further.
Nevertheless, many of Gore's aides and advisers said they were
unnerved, if not panicked, by the state of the campaign. They
expressed hope that despite the fast-moving competition for the
nomination, there was still time for Gore, in the words of Roy
Neel, a confidant, ``to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dogfight for the nomination,'' said Neel, Gore's
first chief of staff in the White House. ``All campaigns go through
cycles of upheaval, dislocation and turmoil. It happens to the
best. But I would never have predicted this. I never did. I don't
even think Bill Bradley would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore has time to recover. He is still viewed by
Democratic leaders as the favorite for the nomination and enjoys
the aggressive support of President Clinton. Although Bradley is
pulling ahead in polls in crucial states like New Hampshire and New
York, Gore is still ahead in other important states like Iowa and
in national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to be interviewed for this article. But in more
than a dozen extensive interviews, people in the highest echelons
of his operation _ including current and former aides, outside
advisers as well as workers in the field _ described the internal
deliberations that led to his predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Past and present campaign officials are engaging in a frenzy of
post-mortems and recriminations; some are blaming everyone but
themselves for giving Gore inferior advice. But, in the end, they
conceded, a campaign is a reflection of its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be a great president, but he might not
be a very good campaign manager,'' said Lorraine Voles, Gore's
former communications director. ``That's not where his skills
really lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of reprimands, most of these people agreed on to speak
only if they were not identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   A senior campaign official, worried that Gore might not easily
recover, said, ``The thing that's most heartbreaking to me is he's
a solid, strong candidate who ought to be president for a million
different reasons.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather than one misguided move, the Gore campaign's current
state results from what Neel described as ``a conspiracy of
factors.'' No one will ever know whether different decisions would
have left the vice president in a better position, or a worse one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the interviews, people in the campaign cited several
things that _ in hindsight _ they would have done differently
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most fundamental, they said, was Gore's inclination
to mount a traditional, incumbent-style race from the White House.
Repeatedly, advisers said, he resisted pleas from some advisers to
break free from his formal role and present himself as a candidate.
Instead, Gore and others felt that if they could clear the field of
his most threatening rivals, notably House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, and act as if he were already the nominee, he could stay
above the political fray and easily capture the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's advisers did not consider that the public might
not be eager for a traditional insider's campaign, particularly
after the impeachment and trial of Clinton. They said they had
conversations about locating the campaign headquarters in
Tennessee, but decided it would be too impractical for a vice
president who lives in Washington. And virtually no one, they said,
viewed Bradley as a political menace.
</P>
<P>
   Another miscalculation involved how the candidate was presented,
aides said. Gore was adroit at putting the mechanics in place, like
lining up endorsements and building campaign infrastructures in
Iowa and New Hampshire. But aides said the campaign did not devote
enough attention to explaining Gore and giving people a reason to
support him. ``His schedule became so efficient that it lost its
heart,'' said one ``We were putting out press releases of people
endorsing the vice president. But we didn't say why. It all became
about process.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some aides said, Gore was prone to micro-managing
his own campaign; it was initially run not by one strong manager
but by a series of people with varying responsibilities. As a
result, the operation was rife with disorganization, which led to
excessive spending. The organizational woes also made it harder for
Gore to raise money. Aides said the heavy spending was caused by
the campaign's determination to stage fancy (but costly)
presidential-style events _ and by an original reluctance from the
vice president to shed overpaid consultants. For example, the
campaign did not think twice about spending $800 for lighting at
outdoor events in the middle of the afternoon _ just so there would
be fewer shadows for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With repeated staff reshufflings, the campaign also has been
plagued by turmoil and internal skirmishes. Gore's closest advisers
_ including Ronald Klain, who was chief of staff, and Robert
Squier, a media adviser _ have been supplanted by relative
newcomers. ``There was a long time when everyone was in charge _
and no one was in charge,'' said one top aide. The campaign's two
most important forces now are Tony Coelho, the former congressman
who took charge in May, and Carter Eskew, a media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   While Eskew is an old friend of Gore's, the vice president and
Coelho do not have a particularly deep history. That is a marked
contrast to the tightly-controlled Bradley and Bush operations,
which are run by people who have been close to the candidates for
years, and have been far more disciplined in putting forth campaign
themes and using resources.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the Gore campaign credit Coelho for at least
taking charge and making decisions. And they credit Eskew for
forcing Gore to lace his speeches with gripping biographical
detail. Yet they complain that upheavals in leadership have left a
campaign that is still in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is Gore's image. Many advisers still recall _ and
they shudder when they do _ the news conference in March 1997 when
Gore defended his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign,
declaring repeatedly, that there was ``no controlling legal
authority'' that found he violated the law. They said that
performance, and subsequent incidents, have cemented a public
impression of Gore as a plodding, uninspiring politician.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the image problem, Gore's advisers said, was Gore's
self-deprecating stiff jokes. Several aides said they had told the
vice president for months, if not years, that the jokes had run
their course. But Gore continued to make it a constant theme until
the spring. Gore's advisers also said internal polls showed his
that image was damaged by his well-publicized boast in March that
he is the father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems were not of his making. The Lewinsky scandal, for
instance, froze the Gore campaign throughout 1998. Gore's aides
thought it would appear unseemly to start an overt political
campaign for the White House at a time when it would appear that
the vice president was distancing himself from Clinton's travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign started with this air of inevitability,'' Neel
said. ``But no one would have predicted Monica Lewinsky two years
ago. No one would have predicted that a single Republican would
rise out of a pack of nobodys and raise more than $50 million in
six or eight months.'' Gore has raised raised roughly $24 million;
Bradley, who took in more than Gore in the last last quarter, $18
million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, Gore seemed perfectly poised to
win the nomination. Month after month, he painstakingly courted
constituencies such as labor and Jewish leaders, and he toiled
behind-the-scenes to demonstrate that he had so much political
muscle that most of his rivals bowed out of the race, from Gephardt
to Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska to Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers eyed Gephardt as its greatest threat because he
could best compete for all of the institutional advantages that the
Vice President wanted, from fund raising to endorsements from
lawmakers and unions. Gore and his advisers were so preoccupied
with denying Gephardt any advantages _ he devoted much of last year
cozying up to the House leader _ that they took steps like hiring
his speech writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became such an obsession,'' said one adviser. Asked about
Bradley, the adviser said, ``I don't think anyone ever thought it
would be a big deal if he ran.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Gephardt announced in February that he would not run,
Gore and his people felt that the campaign was on track. ``When
people dropped out of the race, that kept us feeding on the idea
that Gore's got a good grip on things,'' said another top adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said the campaign lulled itself into a false sense of
security. ``As vice president, you come into the race and you don't
see any real opposition out there,'' he said. ``All your polls are
good. The economy's great. Unemployment's low. The stars look all
lined up. I would fault the campaign for one thing: they put it
into fourth gear before he started out in first gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Bradley made clear that he was running for president,
the Gore campaign took months to retool its strategy. The campaign
was in many ways modeled after Clinton's re-election bid: For as
long as possible, appear presidential and do not make it seem like
you are running for president.
</P>
<P>
   That is why when Gore formed a campaign organization and filed
papers with the Federal Election Commission, the move was announced
on New Year's Eve, so few people would notice. The campaign did not
even plan to launch Gore's showy announcement tour until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They legitimately, though incorrectly, thought they could wait
to put a campaign together well into '99,'' Neel said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bush's momentum _ as well as Bradley's _ led the
Gore campaign to move up its announcement to June. But many of
Gore's advisers now say the announcement tour was completely
fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the campaign was preoccupied with the announcement
for two months and lavished enormous amounts of money on it. Even
so, the tour was marred by production failures. And Gore's decision
to use the occasion to chastise the president for the Lewinsky
scandal further hindered the vice president from establishing his
own identity. Several advisers said they regret that Gore spewed
out too many policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we needed to do was more forcefully give people a sense
of who Al Gore is and what's in his heart as opposed to what's in
his head,'' said one adviser. ``We began a little too cerebral with
issues. That was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's aides say the entire announcement tour was a
waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Announcing in June was a mistake _ it was too soon,'' said one
adviser. ``It was an overcompensation for an earlier mistake. He
had spent four months not being a candidate _ the perception was
the the only way to get out as a candidate was to announce. But we
spent the months of May and June doing nothing but getting ready
for the announcement. And we ended up getting mixed press from it
at a critical time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, a Gore supporter, said the
campaign's most daunting challenge now is to overcome its image as
inept. ``Everyone's telling horror stories _ whether they're true
or not, they catch on,'' he said. ``We have to turn this thing
around.''

GIULIANI, MUSEUM LOCKED IN FIRST-AMENDMENT BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- In Friday's courtroom battle between the Brooklyn
Museum of Art and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, one moment crystallized
the entire conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It came when federal Judge Nina Gershon asked the City Hall
lawyer, Leonard Koerner, if a mayor had the right to walk into any
museum sitting on city property, point to a painting he found
offensive, and say, ``Take that one off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Koerner replied, if the painting is ``not consistent
with the mission'' of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   To the museum's advocates, Koerner's answer confirmed what they
have proclaimed: that Giuliani's threat to shut down the museum,
unless it closes a controversial show, poses a threat to the First
Amendment's guarantee of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``A First Amendment catastrophe,'' was how Floyd Abrams, the
museum's lawyer, described it.
</P>
<P>
   But in City Hall's view, the logic is equally clear: if art is
hung in a city-owned building that relies on heavy city subsidies,
there is a line of taste that cannot be crossed.
</P>
<P>
   If the art ``creates consternation in the community . . . there
is a point when you can interfere,'' Koerner said.
</P>
<P>
   The morning-long clash revolved around such basic questions as
whether First Amendment freedoms have limits and whether the mayor
can declare himself the one who sets those limits.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours of argument, Judge Gershon asked for more
documents next Thursday. She is expected to rule on the case
several days after that.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy started on Sept. 22, when Giuliani warned the
Brooklyn Museum that if it did not cancel an exhibit called
``Sensation,'' he would cut off its city subsidy, which amounts to
$7 million a year, one-third of the museum's operating budget.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit features several provocative works, including a
painting of the Virgin Mary decorated with elephant dung, which
Giuliani pronounced ``sick,'' ``disgusting,'' and
``anti-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   After the exhibit opened last weekend to record crowds, Giuliani
carried out his threat. The museum responded by suing the city and
the mayor for violating its First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has insisted that the First Amendment does not protect
public subsidies of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams argued Friday that even when the city gives money to
a museum, its officials ``don't become the proprietors, they don't
become the moral censors.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gershon pursued the point, telling Koerner that public
libraries are ``filled with works that are offensive to one group
or another''; does the city think it can pull books off the shelf
or shut the library down?
</P>
<P>
   Koerner never directly answered the question, but replied with a
question of his own: What if the Brooklyn Museum's directors turned
it into a museum of pornography? Would its lawyers argue ``that we
couldn't stop funding it because it's protected by the First
Amendment?''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams never directly answered that question, preferring to
build on Gershon's public library analogy. ``There are lots of
books that have done enormous harm,'' he said. ``The First
Amendment protects them.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cited a case in which the city of Miami ended its lease
with the Cuban Museum of Arts and Culture after the museum
displayed works by Cuban artists who supported Fidel Castro. The
city's lawyers noted that the exhibit offended many Miami
residents, and also argued the museum had violated its lease.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Supreme Court rejected these arguments, concluded
that the city had violated the museum's First Amendment rights, and
ordered it to restore the lease.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brooklyn case, too, the city's lawyers argue that the
museum has violated its lease, which states the museum must be
``accessible to the public and private schools.'' The lawyers say
the ``Sensation'' exhibit is ``clearly unsuitable'' for
schoolchildren; this violates the museum's mission of attracting
children; and so, the exhibit must be cancelled and the museum
evicted from its premises.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams ridiculed this argument, saying the lease does not
require the establishment of ``a childlike museum in which no one
can be angry, no one can be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams then quoted a deposition in which deputy mayor Joseph
Lhota said one test to judge the suitability of art might be,
``Would I like my 8-year-old daughter to see it?''
</P>
<P>
   Some spectators in the packed courtroom laughed, and others
gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Gershon asked Koerner if the city really was arguing that
all the museum's art ``has to be suitable for all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Koerner replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   To the city, that's only being reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   To Abrams, the exchange was evidence that the mayor and his
aides have no standard of artistic ``suitability'' at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making it up as they go along,'' he said.

STATE FARM ORDERED TO PAY $1.19 BILLION IN DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state judge in Illinois decided on Friday that State Farm
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. had defrauded policyholders by
requiring that damages from automobile accidents be repaired with
lower-priced generic parts, and ordered the insurer to pay $730
million in actual and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in the same court decided on Monday that State Farm had
breached its contracts with policyholders by having repair shops
use parts that were not authorized by auto manufacturers. The jury
ordered State Farm to pay $456.1 million, so Friday's verdict
brought the total damages from the case to $1.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm officials had said on Monday that they would appeal
the jury verdict, and on Friday they vowed to appeal the decision
by the judge, John Speroni, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rust, the chairman and chief executive of State Farm,
said in a statement that the generic parts were just as good as
factory-authorized parts and were mentioned in the company's
brochures and repair estimates. State Farm's practices are typical
of the insurance industry and comply with regulations in every
state, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who filed the class-action suit against State Farm
in Williamson County Circuit Court in Marion, Ill., said that the
judge's ruling was needed to force the insurer to change its ways.
``It's a wonderful act on behalf of the policyholders,'' said
Trisha Littleton, one of the lawyers. ``It lets State Farm know
they can't get by with this any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was tried in two parts simultaneously _ with the
contract dispute decided by a jury and the fraud issue decided by a
judge. The Illinois law on Deceptive Business Practices requires
that fraud cases be tried by judges.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm announced on Thursday that it was temporarily halting
the use of replacement parts that had not been approved by
manufacturers, in response to Monday's jury verdict. Many
factory-authorized parts are not actually  &UR; manufactured  &LR; by
automakers, which buy them instead from independent auto-parts
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision on Friday, Speroni said that generic parts were
inferior to factory-authorized parts, and that the company had
committed fraud by promising parts that would restore cars to their
precrash condition.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of judicial displeasure that was confirmed by the size
of the verdict, the ruling strongly criticized the insurer's
business practices, particularly the fact that the insurer ``did
nothing to advise the State Farm policyholder of the inferiority of
the parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have tended to side with State Farm, contending
that automakers overcharge for factory-authorized parts and that
generic parts are just as safe and have just as high quality.
Speroni questioned whether generic parts were as safe.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's verdict consists of $130 million for State Farm's cost
savings from the generic parts, plus $600 million in punitive
damages. The money is payable to all U.S. policyholders who had
automobiles repaired with generic parts between July 28, 1994, and
Feb. 24, 1998, except for some policyholders in Arkansas,
Tennessee, Illinois and California, where similar cases are pending
or have been settled.
</P>
<P>
   Because State Farm is owned by its policyholders, the verdicts
could eventually result in higher rates, although Murray Payne, a
company spokesman, said that the insurer would not make any
decision on rates until after its appeal was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Littleton said that another class-action case would be filed
soon accusing State Farm of fraud involving repairs since Feb. 24,
1998, and that yet another case might be filed accusing big
insurers nationwide of conspiring to make generic parts seem as
good as factory-authorized parts.

RED SOX LICK THEIR WOUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After an afternoon dominated by medical updates on
pitcher Pedro Martinez (better) and shortstop Nomar Garciaparra
(ouch), New England won't need a doctor to detect whether the Red
Sox season still has a pulse.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Cleveland Indians in the October twilight, and the
Red Sox will be first-round casualties in the playoffs for the
fourth time this decade and the fifth time in the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   A win would not only avoid a three-game sweep by the Indians,
bidding to return to the AL Championship Series for the fourth time
in the last five years, but will assure that the gates will be open
Sunday for at least one more afternoon in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back wins this weekend, and Pedro the Younger is
harboring hope that he would be available to pitch the deciding
game in Cleveland Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they got us the first night and got us the second
night,'' said Sox DH Butch Huskey during Friday's workout, ``but
there's no reason why we can't do that in this ballpark, then go
from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen. It might be the story of the year, if we can
pull it off. We have nothing to lose, everything to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, with Garciaparra sitting out the workout because of
recurring pain in his wrist, were encouraged by the news that
Martinez's back felt better than it had 48 hours earlier, when he
strained a muscle just below his right scapula (the wing bone),
just below his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling better, guys,'' said a cheerful Martinez, who
reported he slept 12 hours after taking a muscle relaxant the night
before. ``(Today) I'm going to test it, see how it feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try, I'm going to try, do whatever I can to be
back. So far, good signs.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the Sox can even think that far ahead, they will turn
to Martinez's brother, Ramon the Elder, to pitch against Dave
Burba, who like Game 2 winner Charles Nagy features a good
split-fingered fastball to complement his hard stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez has been in this situation before. Against Jimy
Williams's Braves in 1996, he pitched eight innings and allowed
just three hits in a game that his former team, the Los Angeles
Dodgers, would eventually lose, 2-1. But that was before the
reconstructive shoulder surgery he underwent 15 months ago, and
before he was pressed into service in the Red Sox rotation because
Pat Rapp's infant son was born prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez has made just four starts for the Sox, winning
two of them, and pitched effectively against the Indians three
weeks ago in Cleveland, allowing three runs in 4 2/3 innings in a
no-decision. The Sox always figured their fate would ultimately
rest in the hands of a Martinez, but no one ever imagined it would
be Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No better time for him to show up than this time,'' Pedro
Martinez insisted. ``Earlier, when I was struggling, (Bret)
Saberhagen and the other guys picked me up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, me and Saberhagen are gone, and Ramon is there to pick us
up. I have to pray to God and hope that he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek said it would help if the Sox, who have
managed just 11 hits (seven singles) in the first two games, took
the pressure off Martinez by scoring some runs off Burba, a 15-game
winner who faced the Sox just once this season and was not involved
in the decision in a 9-4 Sox win April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night, their guy (Bartolo Colon) pitched awfully
good,'' said Varitek, who struck out three times against Colon in a
3-1 Game 1 loss. ``I hate to tip my cap to any pitcher, but I have
to respect a pitcher after a game like that, especially as a
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday (an 11-1 Game 2 loss), we were out of it before we
were in it. We hit some balls well yesterday, but either right at
people or people made good plays. But some good things started to
happen. I hit one ball I couldn't have hit any better (a line drive
caught by left fielder David Justice).''
</P>
<P>
   Harder to find positive signs in a 10-run loss than the negative
development that Garciaparra's right wrist was acting up again. The
Red Sox shortstop, who went eight days without playing in the
aftermath of being hit by a pitch by Baltimore reliever Alberto
Reyes, found that playing in back-to-back games this week took its
toll.
</P>
<P>
   While Jimy Williams put the rest of the team through its paces
Friday strictly for the benefit of the media _ he would have gladly
skipped the workout, but last year the Sox were fined because they
didn't practice when the league said it was mandatory _ team doctor
Arthur Pappas, a busy man, examined Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Pappas gave Garciaparra an injection of cortisone
after he said an MRI exam showed a bruised tendon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendon is gliding within a sheath,'' said Pappas. ``When
there's a bruise, it's twice the size, and it doesn't like to move.
That's why it hurts like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas said the injury affects the side-to-side motion of
Garciaparra's hand, and is especially noticeable when Garciaparra
goes into the hole on a ball and makes an off-balance throw, and
when he swings and does not make contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he doesn't make contact,'' Pappas said, ``that's when
it's sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who wore a large ice pack on the wrist, underwent
treatment, which included anti-inflammatory medication. Garciaparra
said missing the workout ``was no big deal.'' Both he and Pappas
said there is little question he will play Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wrist is a little sore,'' said Garciaparra, who went
hitless in three Game 2 at-bats after hitting a home run and double
in Game 1. ``(Today), I'll go out and see how it feels. That's all
I can say.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pappas said, Pedro Martinez felt much improved in the
48 hours since he strained a back in his muscle throwing a fastball
to Indians strongman Jim Thome in the fourth inning of Game 1, and
lasted just two more batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to go through his motion without major discomfort
at this time,'' Pappas said. ``The hope is (today) he'll play
catch, then we'll see how he is after that.
</P>
<P>
   The muscle strain is under the scapula, said Pappas, and it is
an unusual place for a pitcher to have injured himself. Pappas
suspects Martinez may have hurt it by overthrowing his fastball to
Thome. The pitcher feels it most, Pappas said, when his arm is at
full extension, just as he releases the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends how he throws (today),'' Pappas said. ``But it's
all very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, meanwhile, are looking to close out the Red Sox in
a series in which they have made judicious use of the long ball _ a
two-run home run by Thome in the opener, a three-run homer by
Harold Baines, and a grand slam by Thome in Game 2 _ to complement
superb pitching and better defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of the team is upbeat, obviously,'' manager Mike
Hargrove said. ``But we also know that the job's not finished.
Boston's not dead in the water. They have a good ballclub. I can't
emphasize that enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox met briefly in their clubhouse before taking the field,
but it was no time for inspirational, Remember the Alamo oratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no magic to how you win in the playoffs,'' Garciaparra
said. ``We played 162 games so far. Now you don't change a thing.
You go out and keep doing the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And hope you're still drawing a breath come morning.

PARTISANSHIP PREVALENT EVEN AS LOTT LOOKS FOR WAY TO POSTPONE VOTE
ON TREATY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Acknowledging that he lacks the votes to ratify a
treaty banning nuclear testing, President Clinton pleaded with
Senate leaders Friday to delay action. But he refused to give in to
a Republican demand that he withdraw the treaty, and thus concede
that it will not be enacted while he is in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he would be willing to wait as long as a year
for a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty if it got a fair
Senate hearing on its merits. As the Senate opened debate Friday,
Clinton said the arguments surrounding it had deteriorated into a
nakedly political exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader who firmly
opposes the treaty, rejected the president's entreaties and said he
planned to proceed with a vote on Tuesday. ``This treaty is not
going to be ratified; it's not going to happen,'' Lott said. ``So
let's have this debate, and, as for myself, I'm ready to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's political position is both strong and tricky. He has the
advantage in dealing with the president. But a majority of the 55
Senate Republicans are believed to support a move to delay action
on the treaty to avoid a political and diplomatic embarrassment for
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So behind the scenes, Lott and his lieutenants were seeking a
way to postpone the vote and still satisfy those Republican
hard-liners who want to kill the treaty, regardless of any
embarrassment to the United States, and inflict political pain on
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives who believe the treaty is fatally flawed are
pushing for a quick vote. Officials on Capitol Hill and at the
White House said Friday night that the impasse is not likely to be
resolved before Tuesday, when senators return to Washington and
resume their deliberations on the accord.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton all but acknowledged that the treaty will not be
ratified while he is in office, he adamantly refused to sign a
document formally asking that the pact be withdrawn and agreeing
not to submit it again during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want me to give them a letter to cover the political
decision that they have made that does severe damage to the
interest of the United States and the interest of nonproliferation
in the world?'' Clinton said angrily. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor, the treaty's critics and supporters spent
inconclusive hours debating its merits, most speaking from prepared
texts and hardened positions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats begged for more time to sell the treaty's virtues,
while Republicans said its flaws will never be overcome by argument
or amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the spread of nuclear
technology would be ``ineluctable'' if the test-ban treaty were
voted down by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not reject this treaty,'' Moynihan said. ``The word
will be that we said `No,' just as in 1919 we said `No' to the
treaty of Versailles.''
</P>
<P>
   He was answered by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who characterized
the treaty as ``nothing short of unilateral disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in the White House they honestly believe that
if we all stand in a circle and we all hold hands and we all
disarm, then everyone's going to be happy,'' Inhofe said. ``But I'm
not at all satisfied with that. I feel that we have to have the
nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he did not intend to use the treaty as a political
weapon in next year's elections and said he would be happy to give
Lott full credit for its approval if it can somehow be refashioned
to be acceptable to a majority of senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they adopted it, I'd be glad to say it was Trent Lott's
triumph,'' Clinton said. ``I don't give a rip who gets the credit
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott gave no ground Friday afternoon, even as his lieutenants
quietly sought a compromise that would avoid the embarrassment of
voting down a treaty supported by America's allies and much of the
American public while denying Clinton an instrument of political
blackmail. Lott said he believed the treaty was fatally flawed and
would not be approved by the current Senate next week or next year.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed the president and Democratic supporters of the pact
for demanding a vote _ and then immediately reversing themselves
after Lott mischievously agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally they got what they wanted,'' Lott said, ``and then
they said they didn't want what they said they wanted.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lott's hard-edged remarks on the floor Friday reflect the
balancing act he faces in trying to lead not just the Senate, but
also his diverse caucus of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is a consummate deal maker who has no desire to be
remembered as the first majority leader to preside over the defeat
of a major international arms treaty in more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ratification of the treaty requires two-thirds approval by the
Senate, or 67 votes if all 100 members are present. Both sides say
the pact is far short of the needed votes because of Republican
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, the Democratic leader, said that
Democrats were likely to introduce a motion to remove the treaty
from the Senate's ``executive calendar,'' a move that requires only
a majority vote. That would delay consideration for an
indeterminate time and allow the treaty to be taken up whenever a
majority voted to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Colin Powell, who supports the treaty, Friday
phoned Senate leaders to urge them to delay the decision to provide
time to generate the needed votes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the
Foreign Relations Committee, said that Powell had told him Friday
that it would be better to leave the test-ban treaty in limbo than
to defeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Biden repeatedly expressed outrage throughout the day at what he
called the Republicans' procedural strategem.
</P>
<P>
   He contrasted the number of days of hearings held before other
arms-control and diplomatic treaties recently brought to the Senate
with the one day of committee hearings and two days of floor debate
accorded the nuclear testing treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break,'' Biden snarled at one point. ``C'mon, c'mon.
This is a stacked deck.''
</P>
<P>
   As debate on the floor unfolded, several senators continued to
work behind the scenes to avert a vote on the treaty, which is
likely either late Tuesday or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services
Committee, said he was circulating a letter among senators
appealing to Lott to shelve the treaty rather than subject it to a
near-certain defeat, which would hurt American interests around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   But it was unclear if Democrats could persuade at least six
Republicans, for a total of 51 senators, to join them to approve
the procedural motion that Daschle intends to offer. Votes on
procedural motions in the Senate are usually tests of party
loyalty, and even Republicans who favor delaying a vote might be
reluctant to cross party leaders without Lott's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Warner and Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who strongly supports
postponing the vote, said they would study the Democrats' motion,
but declined to embrace it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Top Republican aides said they were still waiting for additional
assurances from Clinton and Senate Democrats that they would not
raise the treaty next year as a campaign issue. ``We'll be
listening to what they say over the weekend,'' said one top aide.

RESEARCHER DEBUNKS CPR AS LIFESAVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``ER's'' George Clooney resuscitate one patient after
another gives people unrealistic expectations of survival rates
from cardiopulmonary resuscitation, according to a Brandeis
University medical sociologist who believes the best use of CPR in
many cases is to buy time for loved ones to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Public education programs across the country long have advocated
and taught CPR as a way to keep alive someone whose heart has
stopped, by assisting his breathing and compressing the chest to
keep the heart going.
</P>
<P>
   But Stefan Timmermans, who has witnessed more than 100 emergency
room efforts to revive patients with CPR, the author of a book
titled ``Sudden Death and the Myth of CPR,'' said that because
survival rates are extremely low, the procedure should be looked
upon not so much as a lifesaver, but as a way to give the dying
person a few last minutes of consciousness with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Timmermans emphasized that he is not saying people should stop
learning CPR, since bystanders who witness someone dropping to the
ground with cardiac arrest are vital to efforts to keep the victim
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of success are especially high when the victim's heart
is in ventricular fibrillation, meaning its pumping chambers quiver
irregularly and rapidly and do not forward blood flow. CPR often
buys time for defibrillation to save the victim's life.
</P>
<P>
   Timmermans said, ``It would be more appropriate to redefine
resuscitation as `defibrillation first-aid.'
</P>
<P>
   ``CPR, defibrillation, and the emergency medical system are sold
to the public as the key to saving all human lives,'' Timmermans
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the time won by emergency efforts, Timmermans said, the
victim's family should be encouraged to be at the side of the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard CPR not so much a means of saving lives as a means of
`saving death,' making sudden death more dignified,'' Timmermans
said. ``It gives a temporary reprieve, long enough for family to
gather and have a few final moments with a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason why CPR has been glorified in the United States is
because historically, physicians have seen death as a failure, said
Dr. James Adams, vice chairman of emergency medicine at Brigham and
Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has prevented us from helping patients with the dying
process,'' said Adams, who said that emergency physicians spend a
lot of time contemplating issues surrounding sudden death and how
to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still do CPR aggressively on everybody, everybody,
everybody, unless those people express their opinions to the
contrary,'' said Adams. ``It has become a dying ritual, so in order
not to have CPR, we must ask for permission. Sometimes a patient
needs to hear that CPR is not going to be of life-sustaining
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   A reason for low survival numbers after CPR is because its
application is so widespread, he said, and CPR was never intended
for all patients at the end of life, such as those with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other countries look at us curiously because we do apply it to
so many people at the end of life,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of people resuscitated is 65, Timmermans said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all physicians and health officials see the statistics for
survival of CPR-aided patients as gloomily as Timmermans does.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has been lauded as a city that has a particularly high
community survival rate after CPR, but Timmermans said that is
because officials there only counted patients with certain
conditions who collapsed in front of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Fran Hazinski, who is on the committee writing CPR
guidelines for the American Heart Association, said that the low
survival rate numbers _ some in the single digits _ are misleading,
because they are an average of cities that have high survival rates
and those that have very low survival rates after CPR.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the survival rate from resuscitation efforts is 24
percent, said Richard Serino of the Emergency Medical Service.
Serino said that the rate has increased over the years, as a result
of education and putting more than 150 portable defibrillators in
buildings such as the John Hancock and the Boston Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians saw some disadvantages to Timmermans's suggestion
that families be present during resuscitation efforts. ``It can be
hard for the family to see the person nude, while we pump their
loved one like a piece of meat,'' said Dr. Peter Moyer, director of
emergency medical services at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, who said that when his father died he realized that it
was important for his mother to know that everything had been
tried, said that at BMC, while he does not involve families in the
resuscitation efforts, he is not against doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando, Fla., Dr. Edgardo Rivera, associate medical director
for EMS in Orange County, Fla., said he asks families if they want
to watch the resuscitation efforts, and about 40 percent will
choose to stay and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Rivera said, he had been working on a man for a long time
when he realized that the family was there. Rivera asked the son if
he wanted to watch. Right after the son rubbed the man's hand and
talked to him, his heart stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the guy was trying to survive to see his son, to
say, `I want to see my son before I leave,' '' Rivera said.

 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a time of editorial turmoil for prestigious scientific
publications, The Journal of the American Medical Association named
a new editor on Friday _ the first woman and the first pediatrician
in its 116-year history.
</P>
<P>
   She is Dr. Catherine DeAngelis, 59, who worked for four years as
a nurse before going to college and then medical school. Dr.
DeAngelis is now a vice dean at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore and the current editor of the AMA's journal
Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis' appointment as the 15th editor of the Journal of
the American Medical Association comes as many scientific journals
are under pressure to increase income for the professional
societies and companies that own them.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis' predecessor, Dr. George Lundberg, was dismissed
last January, accused of publishing a paper on whether college
students think oral sex is ``having sex'' to influence President
Clinton's impeachment trial. The dismissal fueled a controversy
over the journal's editorial independence.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Dr. Jerome Kassirer resigned as editor of The New
England Journal of Medicine in a dispute with its owner, the
Massachusetts Medical Society, over the marketing of the journal's
name as part of the society's growing publishing empire.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis has a reputation as a no-nonsense editor and
administrator. At a news conference in New York on Friday, she was
asked whether she would have published the manuscript that led to
Lundberg's dismissal. She replied, simply, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she had been given any guidelines about what
articles she could publish, she replied: ``You're joking; obviously
you don't know me. Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   To prevent another embarrassing episode similar to Lundberg's
dismissal, the AMA is creating a committee to evaluate Dr.
DeAngelis' performance each year and adjudicate any clashes between
the editor and the organization's executives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis said she expected to develop a close relationship
with the committee and to consult members as ``an extra brain
trust'' on various issues, as editors often tap their editorial
boards.
</P>
<P>
   But while she said at first that she did not think such
consultations would pose a potential conflict of interest with
committee members _ who would be in a position to recommend her
continuation or dismissal _ she said in an interview later that she
might rethink her position, because she had not considered the
potential for such a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis, who has appended her own pithy comments to other
authors' papers in the pediatric journal, said she intended to
publish biting editorials in her new one.
</P>
<P>
   As a children's advocate, she said, she may publish more
scientifically acceptable articles on violence, lack of health
insurance for children, and substance abuse. Women's health may
also get more attention in her journal, she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis, who was born in Scranton, Pa., said that she had
wanted to become a doctor since the age of 4 but ``was told that
girls became nurses'' and that her family could not afford college
tuition. She worked as a nurse for a year at Columbia-Presbyterian
Hospital, where ``everyone told me that I was in the wrong
profession, and I looked at physicians making rounds and I knew I
was in the wrong profession.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to receive degrees from Wilkes University in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa.; the University of Pittsburgh Medical School and
the Harvard School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``My background in nursing has made me a much better physician
and person,'' Dr. DeAngelis said.
</P>
<P>
   At Johns Hopkins she was instrumental in writing and
implementing a new curriculum that emphasizes learning from
patients outside the hospital, championed recruiting more women on
the faculty and received awards for her clinical teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. DeAngelis has a certificate in the business of medicine from
Johns Hopkins that should be helpful in running the 11 scientific
journals that she will oversee as chief editor of the AMA's
division of scientific information and multimedia. The association
says its publications bring in $54.7 million of advertising a year,
accounting for 25 percent of the annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Income from publishing is crucial to the AMA because membership
has dropped. Thirty-four percent of doctors in the United States
are AMA members, down from 45 percent in 1988, the Chicago-based
organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Membership has fallen in part because the AMA was severely
criticized for endorsing home health products that it had not
tested, in a deal with Sunbeam. The AMA has paid $10 million in a
settlement for breach of contract.

   NEW YORK _ It was just a single in a deadlocked Game 2 of
another division series against the Yankees' playoff pets. It was
not the ninth inning, not the winning hit, not a perfect ending to
a major league run of two fruitful decades filled with hundreds and
hundreds of hits much more impressive than a measly ground ball
through the right side.
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, could not be mistaken for Hollywood's 20-20
vision of a final Yankee Stadium bow. It was not Kevin Costner
looking marvelous on the mound, just Chili Davis ``fighting for my
life'' at the plate. It was Davis doing nothing beyond the norm,
applying himself as a professional hitter, plying his trade,
working the pitcher and later refusing to admit his job as a
ballplayer was almost done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about the future,'' he said after the
Yankees' 3-1 victory on Thursday night, using that unwelcome query
from the columnist with the Costner-contrived angle as a
springboard to the shower. ``I'm hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungry, if we may indulge ourselves, for a last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   We won't know for a while if Davis will retire, as expected, or
how many clutch postseason hits remain in his bat, until the
Yankees complete their October business. But _ who knows? _ the
last one to savor might have come in the seventh inning of Game 2
against a tiring Rick Helling and the flailing Texas Rangers. The
game that most likely determined if the Rangers had a competitive
series in them, or would once again be a doormat on which the
Yankees would step into the second round, was still up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 1-1. Tino Martinez was on first, having led off
the home seventh with a walk. And here came Davis, 0 for 2 against
Helling, two strikeouts against a right-hander throwing all night
in the low- to mid-90s. More important, Helling was having pinpoint
location that was abetted by a plate umpire with a generous view of
the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' 40th birthday awaits him next Jan. 17. With his
pinstriped shirt removed, the softness around the midsection is
hardly excessive for a designated hitter on the downside, but
obvious just the same. With the shirt on, with the bat in his
hands, more jarring has been the apparent slowing of Davis'
venerable swing. After a sizzling start this season, his average
after June 15 has hovered around .215.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis did finish with 19 home runs and 78 runs batted in,
Darryl Strawberry got the Game 1 start. Of the two friends from
southern California, it is widely presumed that Strawberry has the
better chance of having his contract option picked up for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, meanwhile, had begun to ponder going home to ride his
motorbikes, to play golf. Just not Thursday night, which might have
dragged into early Friday morning like a Mets game from Phoenix had
Davis not fought off a couple of the Helling fastballs that he had
twice struck out on, once looking.
</P>
<P>
   He fouled two off the other way, the ball looping into the
stands behind third. The count ran full. Davis dug in.
</P>
<P>
   ``All fastballs, two-seamers, with a little sink in them,'' he
said. ``He was trying to get me to hit it in on the ground, or get
another call. I wasn't going to let the ump ring me up again. I was
just trying to protect the plate, waiting for him to maybe make a
mistake, battling.''
</P>
<P>
   The foul-ball swings had not been promising, but Davis
understood that Helling was around 120 pitches for the game and was
due to put one in a place he could handle. It came on the 3-2
pitch, with Martinez, no Lou Brock, getting a jump. The ball was
down, but over the heart of the plate. Davis, bat speed be damned,
spanked it past Rangers first baseman Lee Stevens, into right, and
Martinez lumbered to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big base hit,'' Yankee manager Joe Torre called it, ``that
put us in position to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry jumped off the bench to greet Davis in the dugout as
Clay Bellinger went in to pinch-run. ``That's a perfect situation
for Chili,'' Strawberry said. ``Young pitcher who's tiring,
first-base hole to shoot for, and you know Chili's feeling no
pressure. Had that ball been up, he would've crushed it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would have been more of a Kevin Costner moment.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the table was set for Ricky Ledee to double in the
winning run. Roger Clemens' Game 3 pressure, Saturday night in
Texas, was gone. The Rangers, again failing badly in the realm of
timely execution, fell into an 0-2 hole like their cousins in
playoff misery, the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Texas annually seems to be an excellent example of why 90-plus
victories and a lineup decorated with run-producers are no
certification of quality baseball in this era of pitching-diluted
opponents operating on the cheap. At this level, winning and losing
are often determined in less-muscular and inelegant ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``All night, Helling was hitting his spots,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he missed. Davis found a hole. The Rangers are in one
the size of Texas.

SENDING A MONDAY MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Monday practices at Spaulding Field are usually
peaceful. UCLA players stretch sore muscles in routine drills and
the coaches correct mistakes in an easy, reassuring manner. There's
no tackling and little contact.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Monday's practice included cracking helmets,
colliding shoulder pads and a 15-minute scrimmage _ the first
Monday scrimmage of Bob Toledo's coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to turn up the heat,'' Toledo said. ``(The players)
know I'm not happy. I told them, `It's not punishment, it's to get
better.' . . . I want to see us get more physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo was concerned about his team's psyche after a last-minute
loss to Arizona State eliminated the Bruins from the Rose Bowl
race. (UCLA has lost five of its last seven games, dating to last
year.) He hoped a scrimmage would sever any lingering lethargy and
prepare the Bruins for tonight's game against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really good week of practice,'' Toledo said Thursday.
``There was no complaining. They responded very well. I hope it
pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not ready: Don't expect former quarterback Drew Bennett to
get much playing time tonight at his new position, receiver.
Although Bennett understands the offense and has superb hands, he's
learning the footwork required to run precise pass routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands where to go, but running routes takes a lot of
work,'' Toledo said. ``He needs a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Getting his kicks? Oregon kicker Nathan Villegas is
questionable because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his
right (kicking) knee suffered two weeks ago against USC. One of the
Pac-10's best place-kickers, Villegas tore the ligament celebrating
a kick in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch the celebration, you can't figure out how or why
he got hurt,'' Ducks coach Mike Bellotti said. ``More amazing is
that doctors think he could join us'' and kick with a torn
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   If Villegas can't kick tonight, the Ducks will use senior Josh
Frankel, who has made 3 of 4 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hometown team: Offensive tackle Bryce Bohlander is one of
UCLA's best freshmen and its only Oregon native. He attended McNary
High in Keizer and picked UCLA over the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a heck of a job for a freshman,'' offensive line
coach Mark Weber said. ``He needs to get more comfortable, but that
will come with experience. He's got such good knee bend and hip
movement. He really plays stronger than his (270 pounds).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Kickoff is 7:24 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA will operate a free parking shuttle from the Parsons
Engineering Building in Pasadena to the Rose Bowl. Service begins
four hours before kickoff and ends one hour after the game. There
is a $4 parking charge for the Parsons lot.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for the Oct. 16 game against Cal is 12:30 p.m.

U.S. CHARGES TANZANIAN IN EMBASSY BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TERROR-REPORT) 
(mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in New York charged a Tanzanian
man Friday with helping to carry out the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in his country last year, which along with a nearly
simultaneous attack in Nairobi, Kenya, killed more than 200 people
and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 26, was arrested in Cape
Town, South Africa, this week and flown to New York, where he was
arraigned Friday before a U.S. district judge in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed entered a plea of not guilty to the charges, which also
accuse him of conspiring with others in an international terrorist
organization led by Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden is the Saudi exile
who is suspected by authorities of masterminding the embassy
attacks. He remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed is the first of the nine fugitives indicted in the case
to be arrested, and the first defendant in custody in New York to
be accused of a direct operational role in planning and carrying
out the attack in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Others in custody in New
York are accused of carrying out the attack in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the bombings of Aug. 7, 1998, the
indictments charge, Mohamed rented a house in Dar es Salaam that
the conspirators used as their base of operations and also as a
bomb factory.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes after the explosion, Mohamed photographed the
embassy ruins from inside a Suzuki Samurai, which he had rented for
use in the plot, the indictment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Mohamed had
been living in Cape Town under an assumed name, and that his arrest
should serve as ``a stark reminder to all of those who played any
role in the horrific terrorist bombings of our embassies'' that
authorities ``literally around the world will not stop
investigating, searching, capturing, and prosecuting until all
responsible are brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the New York office of the FBI, Lewis Schiliro,
said that the investigation leading to the arrest of Mohamed
included months of ``old-fashioned, persistent and dogged police
work'' by agents of the FBI and New York police detectives who had
gone to Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Mohamed might be in Cape Town, the
investigators did an exhaustive records check, and confirmed his
identity and location. Although the officials refused to say how
they had learned Mohamed was in the country, a South African
official said that the suspect had fled to the country a few days
after the bombings, and had entered illegally under the false name
Zahran Nassor Maulid.
</P>
<P>
   Sipho Ngwema, a spokesman for South Africa's Office of the
National Director of Public Prosecutions, said in a phone interview
Friday night that Mohamed had applied for political asylum in South
Africa under pretenses, and was granted a temporary permit.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested on Tuesday after he went for a scheduled visit
to an immigration office to extend his temporary permit, Ngwema
said, and was then turned over to American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ngwema said that Mohamed had stayed out of trouble in Cape Town
as he sought to ``assume his new identity.'' He kept a low profile
and was apparently working in a fast-food restaurant in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Ngwema said that South African authorities had turned up no
evidence linking Mohamed to the bombing of a Planet Hollywood
restaurant in Cape Town in August 1998, shortly after the United
States shot missiles into Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for
the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, Mohamed sat quietly in blue prison clothes,
speaking softly in English when Judge Leonard Sand asked whether he
had understood the nature of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual exchange, Mohamed twice said no, that he did
not understand the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sand asked, ``What is it that you don't understand, Mr.
Mohamed?''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed replied, ``No, I do understand _ things which used to
make a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment drew raised eyebrows around the courtroom, but it
was not clear whether he was admitting that he had knowledge of how
to make a bomb, or merely understood that it was one of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Mohamed appeared relaxed, at times resting
his face in his hands, and smiling occasionally at his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the government, Sand ordered Mohamed held
without bail and under the same strict jail conditions as the five
other defendants in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional
Institution in lower Manhattan, who are barred from communicating
with virtually all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   If Mohamed is convicted of the charges, he could face the death
penalty, Ms. White said Friday. The lawyer appointed to represent
Mohamed, Jeremy Schneider, said by phone Friday night that he had
no comment on the case.

   RUSSIA: SCIENTOLOGY LOSES LICENSE
</P>
<P>
   A Moscow city court has revoked the license of the Church of
Scientology, saying the organization violated registration laws,
and perhaps tax laws, by listing bogus founders of the sect's local
branch. Tax police raided the sect's center this year. Scientology
officials said the revocation, which was applauded by the Russian
Orthodox Church, was politically driven.

   BELGIUM: BEEF DECISION DUE
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission in Brussels said it was examining a
four-inch-thick report that France had submitted to back up its
decision to maintain an embargo on British beef in breach of
European Union policy. The commission said its scientists would
have an initial evaluation of the report ready by Thursday. The
beef embargo was imposed three and a half years ago because of what
became known as mad cow disease.

   Further talks on compensation for people forced to work as

   Italy has requested the extradition of retired Gen. Manuel
Contreras, the former head of the Chilean secret police, on charges
that he gave the orders for a failed 1975 assassination attempt on
Chile's former vice president, Bernardo Leighton, and his wife, who
were living in exile in Rome. Contreras is already serving a
seven-year prison term in Chile for his involvement in the murder

   VENEZUELA: JUDGES FACE DISMISSAL
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its purge of a judicial system described as corrupt
and inept, the National Assembly writing a new constitution has
announced that more than 100 lower court judges are to be removed
on charges of malpractice. The dismissals come after 22 other
judges were removed by the assembly, which in August declared a
judicial emergency, giving itself unlimited powers to intervene in
the court system.

   COLOMBIA: 4 TROOPS SLAIN
</P>
<P>
   A two-day clash between army units and left-wing insurgents near
a key oil field and pipeline has left at least four soldiers dead,
military authorities said. The fighting took place as efforts were
being made to repair the Cano Limon pipeline, which has often been
attacked by the National Liberation Army, the second-largest of
Colombia's guerrilla groups and a fierce opponent of government
policies encouraging foreign investment in Colombia's promising
energy sector.

   MEXICO: HONORED NOVELIST'S VIEWS
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after President Ernesto Zedillo draped him with a medal
honoring him as one of Mexico's distinguished intellectuals,
novelist Carlos Fuentes urged the government to combat injustice,
corruption and poverty as vigorously as it works to foster economic
growth. If the ancient Aztecs built monuments of stone,
contemporary Mexico should build its pyramids from the lamentations
of dirt farmers, kidnap victims and unemployed laborers, Fuentes
said.

   CANADA: INDIANS DEFY VIOLENCE
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian Indian group, the Mi'kmaq of Burnt Church, New
Brunswick, has vowed to continue fishing for lobster out of season,
despite a week of violence that left dozens of lobster traps cut,
two Indians injured and a rash of suspicious fires that destroyed
pickup trucks, a white-owned house and an Indian religious shrine.
The violence came after the Indians interpreted a new Canadian
Supreme Court ruling on a 1760 treaty as allowing them to fish
commercially year round.

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: WHITE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected, 45 to 54, a bill to nominate
Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to be a federal district
court judge. White, who had been tapped by President Clinton for
the position, is the first black judge on Missouri's state supreme
court. Supporters said White was fit for the nomination. Opponents
said White was not sufficiently favorable of the death penalty. A
``yes'' vote favors the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: AID
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday approved, 51 to 49, a $12.6 billion
foreign aid bill that President Clinton has threatened to veto
because it cuts $1.9 billion from his request. Supporters said the
amount of aid was sufficient. Opponents said the bill fails to fund
many important foreign aid programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AG
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 1, the House passed, 240 to 175, a $69 billion
agriculture spending bill. The bill would provide $8.7 billion in
emergency funds for farmers reeling from bad weather and low
prices. Supporters said the bill should have provided more
emergency aid for farmers and that it failed to address
milk-pricing and trade sanctions issues. A ``yes'' vote favors the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: OPERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 214 to 211, a $12.6 billion foreign
aid bill that President Clinton has threatened to veto because it
cuts $1.9 billion from his request. Supporters said the bill meets
foreign aid spending needs without dipping into Social Security
funds. Opponents said the bill fails to allot funds for the
implementation of the 1998 Wye River Middle East peace accords and
omits restrictions on aid to pro-abortion groups situated abroad. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: TAX-BREAK
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 227 to 205, a bill to allow
citizens to create tax-free savings accounts to cover their medical
costs. The bill would also give tax breaks to those who buy their
own insurance and helps small businesses join together to buy less
expensive coverage. Supporters said the bill would help the 44
million uninsured Americans gain access to health coverage.
Opponents said the bill only helps the healthy and wealthy and
fails to addresss the needs of low-income Americans. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: HMO1
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 193 to 238, a bill, endorsed by
the Republican leadership, that would expand rights of patients
when dealing with their health maintenace organizations by easing
access to emergnecy room care and specialists and allowing them to
sue their HMOs under limited circumstances. Supporters said the
bill gives patients more rights without clearing the way for an
excess of lawsuits. Opponents said the bill's liability provision
was too limited. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: HMO2
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 275 to 151, a bill that gives
citizens the right to sue HMOs that refuse to deliver adequate
medical coverage. The bill also eases access to emergency room care
and experimental treatments. Supporters said the bill would help
prevent HMOs from putting costs above the needs of patients.
Opponents said the bill's liability provision was too liberal and
could lead to an excess of lawsuits against both HMOs and employers
that provide health insurance. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ For more than three decades, Moore's Law has
been an unshakable principle for the computer industry: every 18
months, the number of transistors that will fit on a silicon chip
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Named for semiconductor pioneer and Intel co-founder Gordon
Moore, who first stated it in 1965, the phenomenon has been the
foundation of the computer revolution and the rise of the Internet.
As transistors have been scaled ever smaller, computing performance
has risen exponentially while the cost of that power has been
driven down. And it has been assumed in the industry that the rate
of progress would hold for at least another 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But now a researcher at Intel, the world's leading chip company,
has reported glimpsing a potentially insurmountable barrier to the
advance of Moore's Law much closer at hand, perhaps early in the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the journal Science, the Intel scientist, Paul
A. Packan, says it is not clear whether the most common type of
silicon transistor can be scaled down beyond the generation of
chips that will begin to appear next year, because semiconductor
engineers have not found ways around basic physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fundamental issues have not previously limited the
scaling of transistors,'' he wrote in the Sept. 24 issue. ``There
are currently no known solutions to these problems,'' he added,
calling it ``the most difficult challenge the semiconductor
industry has ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Allison, a Silicon Valley physicist and computer
designer, said: ``The fact that this warning comes from Intel's
process group is really significant. This says that they see actual
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intel report will be echoed by researchers from the
University of Glasgow in a paper to be presented in December at a
conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Without further advances in the miniaturization of silicon-based
transistors, hopes for continued progress would have to be based on
unproven technologies _ alternative materials, new transistor
designs and advances like molecular computing, in which single
molecules act as the digital on-off switches.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such dire warnings have been made periodically in
the past _ an article in Scientific American in 1987 said Moore's
Law was unlikely to be maintained through the 1990s _ and each time
semiconductor designers have shown remarkable ingenuity to surmount
seemingly impossible barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Moore's Law proved to be understated; Moore had to
revise his initial prediction of 24 months for each doubling of
chip capacity. And while it is not an actual physical law, his
observation has taken on an almost mystical quality as the clearest
expression of the power of human science and engineering and many
industry executives have come to see it as a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the advances described by Moore's Law have
had an accelerating impact on the personal computer industry,
driving the cost of desktop machines down from $3,000 to as low as
$500 while increasing their power.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The inventors of the original semiconductor design technology
are for the most part still bullish about extending that progress,
whatever the immediate hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically the economic incentives to find new methods for
device improvement have regularly overcome the predicted scaling
limits,'' said John Moussouris, a physicist and semiconductor
designer. ``The physical challenges may be getting harder, but the
people and financial resources to surmount them are also growing
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time the global semiconductor industry is
grappling with transistors so small that the placement of
individual atoms will soon become crucial.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the current generation of semiconductors, the
wires that interconnect transistors are etched as fine as 0.18
micron _ 1/500 the width of a human hair _ and the individual
insulating layers that are inside a transistor may be only four or
five atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor factories in Japan plan to begin mass production
of chips based on widths of 0.13 micron early next year, and such
chips should be in widespread use within two years. But beyond that
generation, the industry's leading researchers acknowledge there
remain far more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be widths of 0.1 micron, a milestone that in
the Moore's Law progression would be expected three to five years
from now. But at that scale, Packan writes, transistors will be
composed of fewer than 100 atoms, and statistical variations in
this Lilliputian world are beyond the ability of semiconductor
engineers to control.
</P>
<P>
   Packan said he had written the Science article to challenge the
industry and academia to focus on areas where breakthroughs are
needed. ``For the last 30 years we've been engineering the device,
and now what's required is fundamental science,'' he said in a
telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives cautioned against reading too much gloom into
their technical papers, saying that while they did not yet have
precise engineering solutions for breaking the 0.1 micron barrier,
they were confident that answers would be found.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They suggested that part of the reason for Intel's recent
pessimism might have more to do with the need for corporate secrecy
than the arrival of fundamental technical limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face serious challenges,'' said Mark Bohr, an Intel
technology development director and co-author of an internal Intel
technical paper that enumerates the company's unsolved problems.
``We all have ideas to address some of these problems and
admittedly they are iffy and not fully developed, and you don't
want to tip your cards too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carver Mead, a physicist and a pioneer in semiconductor
design, says he still adheres to what has been the conventional
industry wisdom, suggesting that Moore's Law will continue to
account for the pace of silicon technology advances until at least
2014. ``There are still some open issues,'' he said. ``and so the
Chicken Little sky-is-falling articles are a recurring theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Heath, a chemistry professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles who is a co-inventor of the Carbon 60
molecule known as the Buckyball, said the industry might be overly
optimistic because it has such a vast investment in today's silicon
technology.
</P>
<P>
   With researchers at Hewlett Packard, Heath has developed a
prototype memory cell the size of a single molecule that operates
on different principles than today's semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their optimism for being able to continue until 2014
is not very realistic,'' he said. ``When you get to very, very
small sizes, you are limited by relying on only a handful of
electrons to describe the difference between on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at IBM, which along with Intel and Motorola is one of
the nation's dominant chip makers, conceded that it may be accurate
to warn of an impending limit to the shrinking of today's dominant
chips, known as CMOs, or complimentary metal oxide semiconductors.
But they said they believed they had found an alternative approach,
known as silicon-on-insulator, that held great promise at
dimensions of 0.1 micron and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``This paper is quite consistent with work we've published,''
said Randall Isaac, vice president for systems technology and
science at IBM's Watson Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. ``But
when a given technology saturates, it is usually replaced by a new
one.''

BACK AT WORK BUT NEVER FAR FROM FAMILY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill.)  (af) 
Patrice D. Samuels is a freelance writer who lives in New York
City. 
 By PATRICE D. SAMUELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, I closed my old black-and-white
laptop. My intention was to back off from my job as a freelance
financial writer for a few months so I could spend more time with
my children.
</P>
<P>
   Those few months stretched into a few years. Only now am I
returning to work.
</P>
<P>
   For some moms, the decision to leave the working life is the
hard part. For me, the hard part is going back. And I'm not alone.
``Increasingly, moms, and more dads, are facing re-entering the
work force,'' said Janet Chan, editor in chief of Parenting
magazine. ``The nature of two-career couples' lives is changing so
rapidly that these traumas occur almost regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after I stopped work, my husband accepted a job near New
York City and left us in Chicago until our first-born, a son now 8,
finished his first semester of kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   I never did re-open my computer that fall. Instead, I sorted
through the huge accumulation of toys, clothes and equipment that
three children in three years had brought, packing some and getting
rid of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, we moved five times, shuttling among a
hotel, my in-laws' house in New Jersey and a temporary apartment in
New York City before finally moving into our permanent Manhattan
home.
</P>
<P>
   As the months rolled by, it became clear that returning to work
was not an option. I lived from day to day, grappling with problems
like getting our then 2-year-old twins onto a bus with one hand
while holding their double stroller with the other. Occasionally, a
magazine or newspaper editor would call. I would always insist that
I would be back in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, things came together. I found a part-time baby sitter
and, for my son, a piano teacher and a neighborhood soccer league.
My daughters began nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   But my computer stayed shut. One day, a lawyer who was also a
mother asked me what I did for a living. As casually as I could, I
replied that I wasn't working at the moment. ``I keep hearing about
people not working,'' she said, as if she were pondering a puzzling
new form of body piercing.
</P>
<P>
   And so I started thinking about that space in my life where work
used to fit. But it seemed that that space had been swallowed up by
class plays, science projects and baseball practice.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like my son does digging at the beach. He loves to dig
near the tide where he can create a reservoir for the sand crabs
and tiny clams he finds. But the incoming tide always brings sand,
filling the opening as quickly as he can excavate. When I urge him
to move, he resists. He wants the water and the crabs.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the reservoir is the opportunity for work, while the
tide is my family and life, filling the space as quickly as I can
dig.
</P>
<P>
   I have become obsessed with finding out how working parents deal
with sick children, early dismissals from school and everyday
scheduling conflicts, like the time a birthday party for one twin
on the East Side of Manhattan overlapped with her sister's ballet
class and her brother's soccer practice on the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   My unassuming pediatrician confessed that she was forever
begging other parents to fetch one or another of her three
children. The woman in the waiting room with two of her three
children said she often ducked out of her office to pick up one of
her brood.
</P>
<P>
   The professional couple upstairs in our apartment building said
they had hired a full-time baby sitter even though their 6-year-old
girl was in school until 3 p.m. ``Sick kid insurance,'' the mother
explained.
</P>
<P>
   But what about things that can't be delegated? I remember a
neighbor in Chicago, a banker who went back to work shortly after
each of her three children was born. ``It gets much harder,'' she
said to me one night after my children, several years younger than
hers, had gone to sleep. ``Now I have to go upstairs and work on a
science project.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself: Harder? How could a science project
possibly be harder than spending the day with three children under
5? Now I understand. It's one of those items that can't be assigned
to a baby sitter. The sitter can cart the child to speech therapy,
but you wouldn't have her hire the therapist _ or go to the book
fair or be class parent. Those tasks are part of the very reason we
have children; they are what we want to share with them.
</P>
<P>
   Now my twins are starting kindergarten and I have a new iMac. My
children look puzzled as I try to explain the new rules: You can't
interrupt me on the phone anymore, the baby sitter will be picking
you up more often and, by the way, you are going to Grammy's for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   But in my misery over having to set new limits, I remember
something that Janet Jackson, a Manhattan psychologist and friend,
once told me: My children may benefit from my going back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children learn to become more resourceful,'' she said. ``They
start to think of themselves as a family unit that can play
together. They have to rearrange how they relate to each other
because now they can't rely on mom to always come in and pull apart
a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she added, they may actually value their time with me
more.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chan, a working mother herself, suggested that parents
develop survival strategies. These include collecting phone numbers
of restaurants that deliver and being less high-minded about how
much television the children watch.
</P>
<P>
   My husband is supportive but nervous as I beg him to come home
``a little early tonight.'' He is bracing himself for lunch-hour
rushes to the school science fair that I can't attend because I am
on deadline. I am trying to find a space above the tide line where
I can create a reservoir of my own for work. But the tide always
beckons and my family will always draw me back.

THE INDEX MONSTER IN YOUR CLOSET

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 10) 
(af) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft. General Electric. IBM. Wal-Mart Stores. Cisco
Systems. These are the companies that have led this decade's bull
market. The next time a shareholder report for your stock mutual
fund comes in the mail, take a look at its top holdings: You may
find a lot of these big names.
</P>
<P>
   If your fund has held such stocks for a long time, chances are
that it has beaten most other funds in performance. And that may
lead you to believe that you have lucked into a superior fund
manager.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone may come to that conclusion. Some will tell you
that instead, you are actually a victim of an increasingly common
and expensive trend toward ``closet indexing,'' in which mutual
fund managers essentially mimic a benchmark index. And it is a
practice that provokes some strong responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big rip-off,'' said Robert Sanborn, who manages the Oakmark
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, calls the
practice ``horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Closet indexing works like this: A fund manager invests most of
a fund's assets in stocks that comprise the bulk of a particular
index. The manager invests the rest in other stocks _ or to double
up on a few from the index. Despite the lack of significant
stock-picking, the fund still charges fees that are 3 to 10 times
as high as those of a basic index fund, which simply tracks a
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Though shareholders pay a lot extra for such ``active
management,'' the fund, over time, is unlikely to beat the index by
any significant margin. More likely, it will lag behind it _
largely because of the higher fees. And it will bring higher taxes,
because it trades stocks more often. That is not good for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But because so much of the actively managed fund is tied to an
index, it will probably not trail the benchmark by much, thus
avoiding the huge underperformance _ say 10 percent or more _ that
prompts investors to withdraw their money. That is good news for
the fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Closet indexing is not new. But new figures crunched by
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, show just how
strong the trend has become.
</P>
<P>
   To get your arms around the idea, it helps to understand a
measure called ``R-squared,'' which gauges the correlation between
a fund and whatever index _ usually the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index _ it is measured against. If a fund has an R-squared of, say,
90, that means that 90 percent of the fund's movement can be
explained by movements in the component stocks of the index.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar found that for the three years ended in August, the
R-squared of the average actively managed United States stock fund
was more than 74, up from 58 in the three years ended in December
1994.
</P>
<P>
   And among large-capitalization funds _ where stock fund
investors keep $2 out of every $3 _ the average offering had an
R-squared of more than 86, up from 71. Over all, the numbers mean
that more and more of the return of United States stock funds is
tied to changes in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, five years ago, only one in 12 large-cap funds had an
R-squared of 90 or higher; that compares with two out of five
today. As of August, the percentage of such funds had declined
somewhat from year-end 1998, but researchers say that there is a
strong seasonal factor to the R-squared phenomenon, with managers
making their portfolios more like those of their indexes as the
year comes to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, one of every seven large-cap funds _ including a number
of the biggest funds in the country _ still score 95 or higher.
Most of these are virtually indexed portfolios but with far higher
expenses than an index fund, Bogle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a
duck, it's probably a duck,'' Bogle said. ``You're paying a ton
more, and you're getting more turnover, which is a horrible tax
expense, and you're getting fees that are extremely difficult to
justify.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you might expect Bogle to cry foul, because it is his
company's flagship offering _ the Vanguard Index 500 fund _ that is
the subject of the rampant imitation.
</P>
<P>
   The mimicry springs from a number of factors, according to fund
managers, executives and recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies used to be far more willing to tolerate swings in
performance, allowing managers to act on their convictions. Now,
more fund families are single-mindedly focused on the bottom line _
and have found that hewing closely to a predictable investing style
is a good way to attract new customers and to retain old ones.
</P>
<P>
   And in corporate America, the executives who choose funds for
their employees' 401(k) plans, which now account for one-third to
one-half of fund sales at many larger fund families, put a high
premium on performance that is consistent with popular benchmarks.
Such consistency means that corporate officers, often human
resources executives, can avoid the embarrassment of trying to
explain why the large-cap growth fund they selected for the 401(k)
is badly trailing the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   But individual investors have helped to spur the development,
too. Increasingly, they want to make their own decisions on market
timing and asset allocation, and so resent managers who take these
decisions out of their hands. They don't want to wake up and find,
for example, that their large-cap equity fund has put its assets
into cash, bonds or small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many fund managers have stopped swinging for
the fences, because they know the penalties for severely
underperforming an index are now much greater than the rewards for
strongly outperforming it. Nor does it help that the S&AMP;P 500 has
clobbered most funds the last half-dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation packages of fund managers also feed the trend
toward closet indexing, executive recruiters and industry officials
say. A recent survey found that the average manager of a big United
States stock fund makes most of his money through bonuses. Looking
at all portfolio managers, the survey found that their firm's
bottom-line performance matters almost as much as their own
stock-picking records in figuring bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Fund industry officials and recruiters say pay packages are most
often structured in ways that encourage managers to beat their
peers but discourage them from taking the risks necessary to
significantly outperform their benchmarks. For instance, a manager
might get a much higher bonus for finishing in the top 20 percent
of his peer group, but not much more for finishing in the top few
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many funds have become so big and unwieldy that it has
become more difficult to buy and sell large stakes in companies, or
to make big sector bets that can make substantial differences in
performance. Indeed, the difficulty of managing large pools of
money actively has long been an argument in favor of indexing.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this signify for investors? In short, it means
that they may be paying for active management but actually getting
something that may closely resemble an index fund but has little
chance of beating one.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some industry analysts say that the time has long passed
when investors could simply choose between an index fund and one
that sought to beat the market through smart stock-picking. Now, if
they pick the actively managed route, they must choose between
funds that hang close to the index or those that theoretically
could significantly outperform it _ or, of course, lag behind it by
a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of the five largest actively managed
stock funds with R-squareds of 95 or higher for the three years
ended Aug. 31. They returned 21 percent to 26.9 percent annually
over that period. Adjusted for the taxes an investor would have
paid on dividends and capital gains distributions, the five
returned 18 percent to 24.6 percent, according to Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds did better than any of those, with Vanguard's Index
500, the largest S&AMP;P 500 index fund, returning 28.5 percent (27.5
percent, adjusted for taxes).
</P>
<P>
   And of the 80 largest actively managed funds with scores of 95
or higher for the three years, only three _ Vanguard Growth and
Income, Goldman Sachs Capital Growth class A and Pioneer class A,
beat the index fund _ but not by much. And none were able to do so
on a tax-adjusted basis. These 80 funds control nearly $400 billion
of investors' money.
</P>
<P>
   After repeatedly trailing the S&AMP;P 500 in recent years, active
managers have a shot at outperforming the index in 1999. But that
doesn't mean that funds with high R-squareds will necessarily do
better.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three quarters this year, the performance of the
five largest funds with R-squareds of at least 95 ranged from a 0.3
percent loss to a 5 percent gain, compared with a gain of 5.4
percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that investors should opt for a fund simply
because its performance is unlikely to resemble S&AMP;P 500 returns? Of
course not. By and large, you would have been better off in a
closet index fund during the last few years than one that truly
sought to beat the market _ as most of those failed miserably in
that goal. You might say closet indexing is the next best thing to
an actual index fund.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is more complicated than that. Many investors
subscribe to the widely held notion that portfolios should be
divided among indexed and actively managed funds, as a way to
reduce risk. To avoid costly duplication, however, they may want to
stay away from keeping a combination of index funds and actively
managed funds with high R-squared numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the list of large funds with low R-squareds has lately
read like the roster of an underachievers' club. Among them are
some lauded value and growth funds, that despite strong long-term
records, have endured extraordinary rough patches over the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   They include the Mutual Series funds, the Brandywine Fund,
Vanguard Windsor, C.G.M. Capital Development, Sequoia Fund and
Sanborn's Oakmark Fund, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say none have succeeded, even in the late '90s,
when just a very small group of stocks have led the S&AMP;P 500 higher.
Most notable, perhaps, are the funds of Janus Capital, several of
which have easily beaten the S&AMP;P 500 over the last few years. As a
result, Janus has attracted $22 billion in new cash into its funds
in the first eight months of the year, ranking it No. 2 in terms of
cash flow among fund families, after Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of Janus' family, the $32 billion Janus Fund, has a
three-year R-squared of 78, with top holdings as of July 31 that
include American Express, Charles Schwab, Cisco Systems, Comcast
and Enron. The second-largest, Janus 20, scored a 68 and lately has
made its biggest bets on America Online, American International
Group, Cisco, Dell Computer and GE. (While all of these stocks are
in the S&AMP;P 500, their weightings in the funds are far different
than they are in the index.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The lesson is that big rewards still remain for managers who can
shoot the lights out. But the unfaithful flow of investor cash
punishes those who try and fail.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Sanborn of Oakmark, a standout performer in the early
'90s. His huge bets on companies like First U.S.A. and Liberty
Media paid off with a 35 percent annual return during the three
years after its inception in August 1991, compared with about 10
percent for the S&AMP;P 500. But the last three years have been a
different story: Oakmark has returned 12.9 percent annualized for
the three years through Sept. 30, or less than half the index's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in the last year, investors have pulled more than
$2 billion out of his fund, which now has $5.6 billion in assets,
according to AMG Data Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad about it,'' Sanborn said, ``but I wouldn't
necessarily do anything different.'' That is seen in his recent
stock picks, which have included no technology, energy or utilities
stocks _ sectors that comprise more than a third of the S&AMP;P 500.
But he does have big stakes in companies with strong consumer
franchises like Philip Morris, H&AMP;R Block, Nike, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet,
Knight Ridder, Mattel and Black &AMP; Decker.
</P>
<P>
   Sanborn is even willing to suggest that some investors may be
better off indexing. ``Most fund investors are grossly
overdiversified. They should sell everything and have a portfolio
of index funds, or truly try to outperform,'' he said, adding that
``having a guy manage a closet index fund, charging active fees, is
a very poor value.''
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of thinking is harder to find at many fund
companies. That can be attributed in part to the ``style police'' _
fund company executives, fund analysts, consultants, customers,
journalists and other assorted critics who lambaste those fund
managers who suffer poor performance because they stray from the
sort of stocks that people expect them to hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fund managers are under greater pressure to toe the line,''
said Nancy Miller, director of client services at the Mark Elzweig
Co., a New York investment management executive search firm. ``They
will get slapped down for not staying within their discipline, with
customers and 401(k) plans breathing down their neck. They can't
afford to be cowboys any more.''
</P>
<P>
   One oft-cited example of this kind of pressure is the case of
Jeffrey N. Vinik, the former Magellan manager, who left Fidelity in
1996 after putting 35 percent of the fund's assets into cash and
bonds, thus missing out on continued strong performance in the
stock market. (At the time, Vinik said he was ``absolutely not''
asked to leave and that Fidelity's chairman, Edward C. Johnson III,
had recently given him a vote of confidence.)
</P>
<P>
   Another example is Brandywine's Foster S. Friess, who went
heavily into cash in early 1998 while the market continued to rise,
then plowed his money back into stocks later in the year, a few
months before the market suffered a 20 percent decline _ moves that
prompted investors to pull more than $3 billion from the fund that
year, according to AMG.
</P>
<P>
   Vinik's market-timing skills have since been revalidated _ he
now runs a top-performing hedge fund, Vinik Asset Management in
Boston _ while Brandywine is beating the S&AMP;P 500 by 12.9 percentage
points this year through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, after seeing poor performance at a number of its big
funds, began emphasizing quarterly audits of managers in 1997, when
Robert C. Pozen was appointed to oversee Fidelity's fund family.
Some analysts say these audits, called ``quarterly fund reviews,''
may lessen the odds that a big Fidelity fund will ever make another
Vinik-style sector bet or market call.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews examine how a manager performs compared with his
peers and benchmark. Poor returns can thus be explained by looking
at what poorly performing stocks and sectors they owned _ or what
rising stocks and sectors they did not own.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity says the reviews do not encourage closet indexing,
although data from Morningstar suggest that most of Fidelity's
biggest funds have not recently strayed far from the S&AMP;P. 500. In
fact, eight of Fidelity's 11 largest actively managed funds have
three-year R-squareds of 94 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   A number of big Fidelity funds have had ``correlation creep''
with regard to the S&AMP;P. 500, said Jim Lowell, editor of Fidelity
Investor, an independent newsletter based in Potomac, Md. But he
says that is not because of closet indexing, noting that many large
Fidelity funds beat the index last year. Fidelity managers have
``recognized that the leadership stocks basically exist within the
S&AMP;P 500, so it's not too surprising to look at their top 10
holdings and find a lot of familiar names.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity also uses performance fees, meaning that the amount it
charges investors rises or falls depending on whether a fund beats
or trails its benchmark. This pay-for-performance is rare in the
industry: Lipper Inc. calculates that such fees are used by only
150 of the 12,000 United States funds, including Fidelity's.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity dismisses the notion that it is a closet indexer. A
spokeswoman, Anne Crowley, noted that some of Fidelity's biggest
funds beat the S&AMP;P 500 by a wide margin for the year ended Sept.
30, including the $94 billion Magellan, which topped the index by
8.3 percentage points. With such a difference in performance, Ms.
Crowley said, ``to say that it's highly correlated with the S&AMP;P
doesn't seem that relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   She also noted that because Fidelity is one of the few fund
companies that uses performance fees, it stands to lose or gain
hundreds of millions of dollars every year depending on whether its
funds beat their benchmark indexes _ providing a strong incentive
not to closet-index.
</P>
<P>
   But as Morningstar's numbers demonstrate, index mimicry is
occurring across the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've had a change in the fund management industry,'' said
Richard S. Lannamann, who oversees investment management recruiting
at Russell Reynolds Associates, an executive search firm based in
New York. ``People used to trust their money to the fund with the
expectation that the fund manager would do what he thought best for
shareholders,'' including raising cash or making big sector or
capitalization bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now most fund management companies are running with the
assumption than an investor bought a particular product because
they want to be exposed to that asset class, and they don't want a
fund manager to time the market and make big bets,'' Lannamann
said. ``A lot of value is placed on style consistency and risk
control, reflecting the dominance of the pension markets,''
including 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look to fund company executives to try to change that
anytime soon. Chief executives of investment management companies
are roughly twice as likely to be awarded bonuses based on their
company's bottom-line performance as on how well their funds
perform, according to a recent survey by Russell Reynolds and the
Association for Investment Management and Research, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   You might say investors get what their fund executives are paid
for.

CLEMENS READY TO MESS WITH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Roger Clemens does not compete like other
pitchers, it has been said. Rather, the University of Texas alumnus
treats each outing like a football game against the hated
University of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will take the linebacker mentality to the mound in Game
3 of the division series Saturday night. Clemens will be making his
first postseason start in a Yankee uniform, watched in his home
state by his ailing mother, other family and friends, with a chance
to close out the Texas Rangers in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be pumped up,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankee
manager. ``You'll see him talking to himself, yelling at the
umpire, yelling at the catcher. But that's what drives him.
Hopefully, he'll be able to keep his stuff focused and be able to
channel all that energy in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be Clemens' challenge in Game 3, particularly in the
first and second innings. His emotions may be tougher to harness
than the Rangers' offense, which has batted .148 and scored a
single run in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Having won the first two games of the division series in Yankee
Stadium, the Yankees need only win one of the next three to advance
to the American League Championship Series and face either the
Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, was forced to leave
Thursday's game because of bruised ribs that have affected his
breathing since he ran into a fence last weekend. If Game 3 had
been played early Friday, O'Neill most likely would have been
unable to participate, but the Yankees believe he will be in the
lineup Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has been getting messages from college buddies all week,
leading to the right-hander's start in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens forced his trade from the Toronto Blue Jays last
spring, he spoke of how those closest to him encouraged him to go
to the Yankees and pursue a championship. This is what they have
been waiting for, the messages have said.
</P>
<P>
   Cognizant of his tendency to let his energy overcome his
command, Clemens threw three times since his last start on Sept.
30. The standard is to throw about 50 pitches in these bullpen
sessions. Clemens threw about 85 pitches in his last session
Thursday, according to Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching
coach, along with two standard-length sessions and all the jogging
and lifting he does.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will take one last look at the scouting reports,
including those notes highlighted in yellow. He will talk aloud,
using a language all his own. ``It's a Texas drawl, with a little
Boston thrown in there,'' David Cone said. ``He talks real funny. A
lot of times I think he could use an interpreter.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens will review the tendencies of the home plate umpire _
John Hirschbeck, in this case, who usually calls a wide strike
zone. Clemens will do his sit-ups, about 200 in the estimation of
teammates. He will go through a series of stretches and sprints,
power his way through his warm-up pitches. And then he will stalk
purposefully to the Yankees' dugout and wait to pitch his half of
the first inning, a linebacker masquerading as a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's different when he pitches,'' Ricky Ledee said. ``He's
mean. Not toward us _ but just mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clemens: ``I just hope to be able to definitely channel a
lot of the adrenalin I'm going to have and settle in and throw
strikes and play our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, the Yankee catcher, agreed that it will be
important to get Clemens through the first two or three innings,
when his emotions are peaking.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens tends to rush his pitching mechanics when he is excited.
When his front shoulder opens too soon, his fastball will fly high
and outside to left-handed batters, and his split-fingered
fastball, which usually has a north-south trajectory when it
reaches the plate, will move east to west.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed 20 runs in the first inning in his 30 starts, and 52
of the 101 runs he allowed this season were scored in the first
three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens comes into the game with a 1-2 record in the postseason,
a mark that does not reflect how well Clemens has pitched at times
in October. But as Bill Buckner learned, you can have a great
career obscured by bottom-line failure in the postseason. ``In some
respects, the postseason rap is a little unfair,'' Cone said.
``With that being said, I think he still feels this is a big
opportunity for him. I think this is a missing link for his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens walked into the visitors' clubhouse Friday evening,
there already was an edge to his voice. Clemens asked about the
starting time for Game 3, his voice conveying frustration while he
mentioned that he had heard four or five start times.
</P>
<P>
   A clubhouse attendant went to call the Rangers' front office for
the precise schedule, and Clemens suddenly ticked off the forecast,
as if he was in constant contact with the National Weather Center.
``We're supposed to get rain tonight, and then it'll get clear, and
it's going to be 74 degrees and calm,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Clemens' first postseason game in four years, and
perhaps his best shot at obtaining that elusive championship he
craves. There can be nothing left to chance.

FAMED CUBAN BAND IS SET TO PERFORM IN MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (Eds: Spelling of ``Issac'' in 4th graf is correct.) 
(lb) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In presenting the Cuban singer-songwriter Carlos Varela
to a group of listeners in Miami Beach last year, Maria Romeu said
she had bouts of panic during which she worried about his safety.
One of the first artists from Cuba to perform in hostile exile
territory, Varela tested the waters by singing then for select,
word-of-mouth-only audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small venues, out-of-the-way obscure locations, no
advertising,'' said Ms. Romeu, who has a marketing company here and
who promoted those appearances. ``That's not exactly how a promoter
generates revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Varela was a hit, and after he appeared here, more than a
dozen Cuban solo artists and bands trickled in to play more openly
to bigger crowds and dwindling groups of protesters, prompting the
occasional bomb threat _ and in at least one instance a Molotov
cocktail thrown at a club's front door _ but no major controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Headliners like Issac Delgado, NG La Banda, Chucho Valdes and
Francisco Repilado, the guitarist from the ``Buena Vista Social
Club'' documentary who is better known as Compay Segundo, helped
usher in what seemed like a new era of tolerance in an area where
bombings, assaults on concertgoers and public scorn had dissuaded
many Cuban performers from visiting.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, hostilities are at a peak once again with the
announcement that Los Van Van, Cuba's most popular dance band,
which has performed all over the United States but never in Miami,
is coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   The band is to play the Miami Arena on Saturday night, in what
promises to be a test for both freedom of expression in this city
and the shifting views within Cuban Miami, which, after successive
waves of immigration, encompasses people who vary in social class,
race, generation, politics and indeed musical taste.
</P>
<P>
   Los Van Van, arriving here for the next-to-last stop of a
28-city tour of the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, have
stirred up passions partly because they are booked in a venue of
8,000 seats, which would allow by far the biggest audience yet for
Cuban artists here.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the concert is set within Miami, the seat of power
for conservative Cuban exiles, rather than the more liberal Miami
Beach, where almost all the Cuban artists performing in the area
have appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the band itself is a 30-year-old institution regarded
as Cuba's foremost cultural ambassador, which to detractors means
Fidel Castro's handpicked proxy. Even the name Van Van, derived
from a revolutionary slogan, grates on critics.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the concert first prompted Miami city officials to
impose requirements on the local promoter that led to two changes
of date and the moving of the event from one city-owned center to
another.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter, Debbie Ohanian, who said only city-owned arenas
were large enough to meet the expected demand for tickets, sought
help from the American Civil Liberties Union, which threatened to
sue if Los Van Van were in any way prevented from performing.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the band has cleared bureaucratic hurdles, exile
organizations are planning a large protest outside the Miami Arena
on Saturday night. Some callers to Spanish-language radio stations
have even vowed to videotape concertgoers as they enter the arena
so that the city's ``Communists'' can be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last straw,'' Juan Perez Franco, president of
Brigade 2506, a group of Bay of Pigs veterans that is organizing
the protest, said of the concert. ``This is a provocation to exiles
and an insult to the memory of our martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   But while older exiles shun Los Van Van as political envoys, a
growing population of more recent arrivals from Cuba, and many
young Cuban-Americans, welcome them as cultural envoys who help
satisfy yearnings for the homeland or for a connection with Cuban
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami Herald poll of Miamians last month confirmed a sharp
generational split on the issue among Hispanic respondents: Those
older than 50 opposed performances by musical groups from Cuba in
city-owned centers, 65 percent to 24 percent, while those under 50
supported such shows by 50 percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The members of Los Van Van themselves say that denunciation by
conservatives here kept them from trying to perform in Miami
earlier, but that on visits to family and friends, they have found
an increasingly welcome climate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These are different times,'' Cesar Pedroso, the band's pianist
and co-founder, said in a telephone interview. ``Everything
changes. This concert will be an encounter with fans of many years
who have not seen us since they left Cuba, and with the generations
who don't know Los Van Van personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the children of exiles supporting the band is the
42-year-old Ms. Romeu, who was brought to the United States as a
child, was reared in Chicago and became one of a handful of
promoters who have created the Cuban music scene here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about Cuba or Los Van Van,'' Ms. Romeu insisted.
``It's about a glorious music tradition. We talk about the First
Amendment and the extreme Cuban right wing, and nobody is talking
about the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Romeu's fervor for Cuban culture got her fired once, after a
leading Cuban exile group complained in 1994 to her employer, the
Spanish-language network of MTV, that she was using her office
there to help organize a private tour to Havana for a concert by
Varela. The network, MTV Latino, where Ms. Romeu was an assistant
to the managing director, said at the time that she had been
dismissed for using company resources for a personal matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Romeu, who has helped promote and produce Cuban artists'
performances around the United States since the late 1970s, says
she has no regrets. ``That was the beginning of a beautiful
thing,'' she said of her early support for Varela, whose Miami
Beach shows last year she describes as ``unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 250 sobbing people who knew every word of the songs,''
she said. ``Nobody said, `I hate you because you left.' Nobody
said, `I hate you because you're still there.' There was
unconditional reconciliation, and that is the single most important
thing that can happen to our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Cuban-Americans, including some younger ones, say that
even culture must be governed by the rule of law, in this case the
United States' economic embargo of Cuba. Miami's 44-year-old
Cuban-born mayor, Joe Carollo, said in an interview that he
personally opposed Los Van Van as ``Castro's premier band'' but
that in any event the city's interest in the concert was that there
be compliance with the embargo, which requires financial
restrictions on any cultural exchanges with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, city officials demanded that the concert's promoter
produce documentation from the U.S. Treasury Department certifying
that none of the money generated by the concert would go to the
government of Cuba. That documentation was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   The promoter, Ms. Ohanian, a Miami Beach nightclub owner who has
presented half a dozen Cuban artists over the last year without
incident, has been called a ``Castro agent'' on Spanish-language
radio stations here and picketed by small groups of protesters who
have shown up outside her club.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the concert by Los Van Van, she is planning
to present Ibrahim Ferrer and Ruben Gonzalez, two stars from the
Grammy-winning ``Buena Vista Social Club'' album, at the Jackie
Gleason Theater in Miami Beach in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to be the voice of the people who are tired of
all this,'' she said of the protests against Cuban performers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Romeu, she said she was ready to bring Varela back
for a concert tour next year. ``I'm really committed to
disseminating this art,'' she said. ``Why can't I have a right to
it? We grow up hearing, `Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.' How can we not want to
hear Cuban music?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The scope of the conspiracy boggles the mind. For a full decade,
top executives at some of the world's largest drug companies met
secretly in hotel suites and at conferences. When federal
investigators were closing in, they moved to the homes of
high-level European executives.
</P>
<P>
   Working together in a coalition they brazenly called ``Vitamins
Inc.,'' they carved up world markets and carefully orchestrated
price increases, in the process defrauding some of the world's
biggest food companies, including Kellogg, Coca-Cola and Nestle.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in the words of Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice
Department's antitrust division, ``the most pervasive and harmful
criminal antitrust conspiracy ever uncovered.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, after the conspiracy collapsed, those involved agreed to
pay nearly $1 billion to settle federal antitrust charges, by far
the largest criminal fines in American history. Further penalties
could come in Europe and elsewhere. The companies involved have
pleaded guilty to the government's charges, but they have refused
to discuss details of the case beyond what the authorities
originally charged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, virtually every big vitamin maker in the world is on the
brink of agreeing to pay an additional $1.1 billion to resolve a
consolidated class-action suit brought by purchasers of bulk
vitamins _ the raw vitamin ingredients that go into everything from
cereal and orange juice to vitamin pills and chicken feed. The suit
alleges a wide variety of anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   How could a conspiracy on this scale ever be born, much less
survive a decade? How, in a global marketplace filled with
sophisticated buyers and sellers, could a group of multinational
corporations, largely from Europe and Asia, avoid detection for so
long?
</P>
<P>
   They did it, interviews with investigators and a review of court
documents show, with a sly mixture of corporate panache and tight
discipline _ nourished by a European tradition that encouraged such
anti-competitive practices. The big vitamin makers aren't talking,
except to say that they regret fixing prices and are working to
keep it from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't dispute the facts and we've decided it is of no value
to unravel it. The situation is behind us,'' said Carolyn R. Glynn,
a spokeswoman at &UR;  &LR; Roche AG, which is based in Basel, Switzerland.
``We've paid dearly for it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even lacking chapter-and-verse corporate confessions, it is
still possible to piece together the outlines of this historic
swindle.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1989, when executives at Roche and BASF AG of
Germany began holding secret talks about price-fixing, government
investigators said. At the time, both companies faced pressure from
rivals and from the prospect of falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was to agree, in secret, to carve up the vitamin
market and to recruit other big vitamin makers to come in on the
arrangement, like Rhone-Poulenc of France and Takeda Chemical
Industries, Japan's largest pharmaceutical company. Because these
companies have operations in the United States, this was a blatant
violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies seemed to be indifferent to the possibility
that the antitrust laws would be enforced,'' said Robert Silver, a
lawyer at Boies &AMP; Schiller, of Armonk, N.Y., who filed the first
class-action suit against the vitamin makers in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Roche was the ringleader. Its executives, federal investigators
say, organized the meetings, coordinated the price-fixing and
ordered documents destroyed. It wasn't just one Roche officer but a
succession of high-level executives who carried out the details of
the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The company had gone this route before. Roche's antitrust
problems date to the early 1970s, when it was fined by antitrust
officials in Europe for engaging in anticompetitive behavior in the
sale of two tranquilizers, Librium and Valium.
</P>
<P>
   Roche also faced litigation over the vitamin market in 1973
after Stanley Adams, a high-level executive in its vitamins and
fine chemicals division, sent a confidential letter to antitrust
officials at the European Commission in Brussels detailing what he
said was Roche's violation of European law in its dominance of the
bulk vitamin market.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Roche Versus Adams,'' his 1984 book, Adams said the company
regularly fixed prices. Roche would ``get together the major
vitamin and chemical producers and talk prices with them,'' he
wrote. ``Meetings were held, often in Basel. The manufacturers
discussed world prices for different vitamins and chemicals and set
a price which they all agreed to keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the vitamin price-fixing accusations were never proved,
and Adams himself turned out to be less than a savory character _
he was jailed in 1994 for plotting to murder his wife for the
insurance payoff _ the story he outlined turned out to be eerily
similar to the one government investigators described in the more
recent vitamin case.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, there were said to be meetings in Basel,
coordinated price increases and threats to smaller competitors. By
the 1990s, Roche, BASF and Rhone-Poulenc, which together controlled
more than 60 percent of the world's vitamin supply, formed a giant
price-fixing phalanx, the government said in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Roche alone had revenues of $3.3 billion in the United States
while the conspiracy was running, and during that time, Justice
Department investigators say the conspirators gradually and
artfully raised the prices of raw vitamins, so as not to attract
notice. They also rigged the bidding process. The average price of
bulk vitamin A was $11.59 a pound in February 1990; in November
1998, it was $19.84 a pound, according to a study by the lawyers.
The Justice Department says that $5 billion to $6 billion in United
States commerce was affected.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamin conspiracy wouldn't be just a European operation for
long. In 1991, three Japanese vitamin makers _ Takeda, Eisai and
Daiichi Pharmaceutical _ joined in. A year later, prosecutors say,
the cartel included Lonza AG of Switzerland, Chinook of Canada and
as many as 10 other vitamin makers, including Ducoa. There are few
American companies involved in the production of vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   As the operation went global, there were regular meetings in
Switzerland, Germany and elsewhere with a varying circle of
participants, investigators said. The companies exchanged sales and
market-share data, illegally coordinated price increases and
decided, region by region, who would get what share of the market,
right down to the half percentage point, and even the penny, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also efforts to prevent cheating and regular ``budget
meetings'' to make sure everyone was on the same page, according to
the government's court documents. ``This was a very elaborate and
effective conspiracy,'' one high-level Justice Department official
said. ``The companies operated as if they were a single entity. And
they were very precise. It was greed, pure greed.'' &QL;

<P>
   The vitamin business is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, federal prosecutors have broken up three
international food and agriculture cartels that lasted for more
than a decade. The Justice Department says there are now 35 federal
grand juries hearing evidence about the possibility of other global
cartels operating in this country, affecting billions of dollars in
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a number of large mergers in food and
agriculture, as well as criminal price-fixing convictions earlier
this year against executives at the Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
some of the nation's leading antitrust lawyers say the legal
remedies now available may not be enough to thwart price-fixing
cartels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a one-time thing that has been rooted out,'' said
Kenneth J. Adams, an antitrust lawyer who joined the class-action
suit against most of the large vitamin makers. ``There's no reason
to believe this won't happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although Justice Department officials say they have smashed the
cartel, even government prosecutors say they are astonished at what
took place over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the reign of I.G. Farben, the German chemical giant
that operated as a state-sponsored conglomerate in the 1930s and
1940s, has an international cartel so effectively and
systematically manipulated a world market.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the secret vitamin pact may have grown out of a
corporate culture that encouraged collusion, and legal systems in
Europe and Asia that were then far more accommodating to
price-fixing than the American legal environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recent times, European countries didn't have laws that
stopped cartels; in fact, they had laws that encouraged cartels,''
said George L. Priest, a professor of law and economics at Yale
University. ``But today, virtually every country is coming around
to the view that the more competition, the better the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What the vitamin conspirators controlled was most of the world's
bulk vitamin production _ vitamins A, C and E, niacin and other
B-complex vitamins _ a $1 billion-a-year industry in raw vitamin
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The big companies sell the raw vitamins to animal feed
operations, food and beverage makers, and pharmaceutical and
cosmetics companies, which turn the raw products into vitamin
tablets and even skin cream.
</P>
<P>
   America's largest food companies, which blend raw vitamins into
things like bread, rice and juice, said they were unaware of any
unusual pricing practices. ``They saw the price increases and
inquired about them,'' said Jonathan D. Schiller, another lawyer at
Boies &AMP; Schiller, which sued vitamin makers on behalf of big food
companies like Land o' Lakes, the butter maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the vitamin makers justified the increases by saying that
it was exchange rates or production cost increases,'' Schiller
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the animal feed industry, which bought huge amounts of bulk
vitamins, was more alert to the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamin producers shipped raw vitamins, often in powder form, to
a vitamin blender, or pre-mix operator, who then created a special
blend of vitamins that was sold to large farms and animal feed
operations, like the huge chicken farms of Tyson Foods, the world's
largest poultry producer.
</P>
<P>
   It had worked that way for decades, until the 1980s, when
vitamin makers saw the American pre-mix industry as a source of
additional revenue _ a way, some lawyers said, for the companies to
strengthen their hold on the world's biggest market for bulk
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   BASF entered the blender market in 1986. According to lawyers
for the independent blenders, BASF and Roche later tried to destroy
small mixers with what the lawyers called predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   BASF executives declined to comment, but small pre-mix blenders
say BASF charged them high prices for raw vitamins while selling
blended vitamins directly to animal feed operators below cost, in
the hope of snuffing out their independent rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threatened us,'' said Eugene E. Reed, a former vitamin
blender in Little Rock, Ark., who told investigators that in 1997
he sat in on a meeting in Atlanta with a BASF executive who made
threats against an American blender.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told a friend of mine: `You need to remove yourself or
you'll be forced out of the business.'''
</P>
<P>
   There were logical reasons for combining production and
blending, like getting to market faster. But lawyers involved in
the class action say the larger economic reason was simple:
eliminating competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You squeeze out the guy in the middle,'' said Adams, the
lawyer for the pre-mix blenders. ``You vertically integrate, and
then you control both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, blenders and animal feed producers had grown
increasingly suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Among themselves, they repeated tales of threats to small
blenders, and some vitamin customers complained about a lack of
competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did notice that the bids seemed to be unusually
consistent,'' said Les Baledge at Tyson in Springdale, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you went to a competing company they said the supply
wasn't available.''
</P>
<P>
   For the vitamin cartel, the beginning of the end may have been
signaled by the scandal at Archer Daniels Midland. In 1996, the
company agreed to pay $100 million to settle federal charges that
in the early 1990s executives had conspired with European and
Japanese companies to fix the prices of feed additives.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was the biggest international cartel ever
uncovered by federal prosecutors. One key Archer partner was Roche,
which agreed in 1997 to pay $14 million to settle criminal charges
that it helped fix prices for one additive, citric acid.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer case cracked open because of Mark E. Whitacre, an
Archer executive who secretly tape-recorded company executives
discussing price-fixing with rivals. Then came confessions from
other executives. During the investigation, Justice Department
officials heard Roche might have also been fixing prices in the
vitamin market.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no immediate confession on vitamins, partly
because there was no tape and no mole. When Kuno Sommer, head of
marketing in the vitamins and fine chemicals division of Roche, a
key participant in the meetings on citric acid, was questioned by
federal agents in March 1997, he denied that there was any
price-fixing in vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents later discovered, according to the government's
settlement documents, that before the 1997 interview, Sommer had
``met separately with at least two other high-level Roche
executives. At the end of those meetings, it was understood by the
individuals that if Sommer was asked about Roche's participation in
a vitamins cartel, Sommer would lie and deny that such a cartel
existed.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, private antitrust lawyers had begun their own
investigation in hopes of winning a huge settlement. Among their
findings was a memo Sommer had written in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good experience with citric acid,'' Sommer wrote before a
meeting with Archer executives. ``Next opportunity B2. We think
it's worth that we explore all possibilities of cooperation. Let's
explore cooperation product-by-product.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, some of the nation's leading law fims joined the fray.
Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &AMP; Toll was investigating the case.
Lawyers at Boise &AMP; Schiller _ headed by David Boies, who is
prosecuting Microsoft for the government _ filed suit on behalf of
J &AMP; R Feed Services in Cullman, Ala., accusing large vitamin makers
of conspiring to fix prices. A year later, the Justice Department
brought its first price-fixing charges against Lonza of
Switzerland. Then the department turned to the biggest players.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the big three vitamin makers _ Roche, BASF and
Rhone-Poulenc _ denied the charges. Even when lawyers working at
Roche learned about the conspiracy in late 1997 or early 1998 and
directed that it be stopped, according to other lawyers involved in
the case, the cartel continued to operate. Meetings were moved to
executives' homes to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, Rhone-Poulenc broke ranks. It came
forward as part of an amnesty program, begun in 1994, that offers
leniency to the first company to cooperate in a federal antitrust
investigation. Some lawyers involved in the case say Rhone-Poulenc
was eager to appease regulators scrutinizing its pending merger
with Hoechst AG, the German pharmaceutical giant, which earlier
this year paid $36 million to settle federal charges that it had
conspired to fix prices on food preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   After Rhone-Poulenc's confession, the cartel's wall of silence
crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and BASF stepped forward. So did a large group of Japanese
companies, which agreed last month to pay $137 million to settle
vitamin price-fixing charges. Roche was hit the hardest, though,
agreeing to pay $500 million to settle charges, equivalent to about
one year's revenue from its vitamin business in the United States.
Two Roche executives have been sentenced by federal courts to
prison terms of a few months. BASF paid $225 million and
Rhone-Poulenc avoided any fine.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of those payments, the Justice Department's
antitrust division has already recovered $1 billion in all cases
this year, more than in the previous 30 years combined.
</P>
<P>
   Archer Daniels Midland ``was not the iceberg.'' said Klein, of
the Justice Department, ``it was the tip.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What was it about vitamins that nourished a conspiracy?
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts say international cartels develop because the
right dynamics are in place. Most operate in concentrated markets
with few players, making it easy to coordinate pricing. They also
operate in businesses that require a big investment to enter.
Price-fixing commonly involves commodities, like paper or
chemicals, because generic products are harder to differentiate,
allowing conspirators to price uniformly. Vitamins were a perfect
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there have been huge sanctions against the
conspirators, some experts worry that the penalties may not be
enough to prevent cartels from reappearing. Adams, the lawyer, said
the Justice Department ought to compel the breakup of the cartel's
American subsidiaries, because they have already killed off many of
their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department could have imposed structural relief to
inject competition,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The vitamin cartel made billions of dollars, he said, often with
price mark-ups of 20 percent, far more than the cartel will repay
in criminal fines. ``That made it worthwhile,'' he said. ``Their
thinking was, A: You might not get caught. B: If you get caught,
you pay the ticket. Is this simply an expensive license to keep
stealing?''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department doesn't think so. Officials say the
agency has fulfilled its legal duty. They add that the antitrust
division does not have the authority to restructure foreign
companies and does not want to force them to break up American
subsidiaries. ``The penalties coupled with the jail time I think is
a far greater deterrent than structural relief,'' Klein said. ``I'm
confident that we've nuked this cartel.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, questions remain about whether the big vitamin makers,
which dominate the world market, will try again to raise profits
artificially. Even after the Archer Daniels Midland scandal and
government investigations into the vitamin market, investigators
say Roche continued to operate at the head of the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically kept perpetuating it, basically saying it's
worth it,'' one Justice Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Roche was hit with big fines for being a repeat offender,
Roche executives say the conspiracy was carried out by a small
group of rogue executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will understand that this was not part of our
responsibility,'' Franz Humer, the chief executive, said at a news
conference in Basel after the settlement. ``It is certainly not
easy to understand the reasons for actions of employees who in
secrecy organized a conspiracy of this kind.''
</P>
<P>
   BASF executives said something similar, arguing that there is no
foolproof way to prevent another cartel from developing. ``There
will be no 100 percent guarantee that even with audits, everything
will be legal,'' Eggert Voscherau, a BASF board member, said in an
interview with The Chemical Markets Reporter in July. ``We cannot
set up a police state.''

 STOP AND SMELL THE SOURDOUGH  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Money magazine has named San Francisco the
country's most livable city, which will come as startling news to
the people who die here.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine apparently is willing to overlook the fact that
we're in the middle of a thrilling race to see who can shut down
and destroy the city first _ the developers, Muni, the landlords,
the slumlords, the yuppies, the drifters, the junkies, the FBI, the
SUV warriors, the mayor, the mayoral wannabes, the meter maids, the
greedy, the needy, the undecideds, the triple-parkers or the
terminally cranky.
</P>
<P>
   But before you mock Money for its naivete, please consider the
possibility that the magazine got it right.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if the livable-cities competition was the Miss
America pageant, all of the contestants would be pregnant, divorced
and chewing gum. Big cities have big problems.
</P>
<P>
   If San Francisco is falling apart, maybe it's falling apart more
slowly and more charmingly than other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, a glut of wealthy, successful people with too many
big cars want desperately to move to San Francisco and learn
humility at the hands of our four-star maitre d's. While this
invasion creates problems, it's also a sign that the city has some
redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you're hurrying to the protest rally, stop and smell
the sourdough, the tortillas, the garlic, the tempura, the fish,
the fog and the roses.

   THE GRATE-ingness of the Raid-uhs: Stop me if you've heard this,

   Davis says his team needs a full stadium in order to win.
Usually it's the other way around, but Al makes his own rules.
</P>
<P>
   If he needs a full stadium to inspire his gladiators, Davis
should give one of the Oakland high schools a call.
</P>
<P>
   They'd be glad to rent out one of their fields every Sunday. The
rental fee will help offset the cash shortage caused by the drain
from city coffers caused by the ludicrous deal the city cut to
bring back the Raiders four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Really, though, Al needs to take the Raiders back to Los
Angeles, where, dripping with diamond-and-silver jewelry, Davis can
be limo'd to the city's hippest restaurants, where he kicks back
with his Beverly Hills pals and bemoans the fact that his players
have gone Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner Davis can get the Raiders back to Los Angeles, the
sooner the Oakland politicians can get to work on a new scheme to
bankrupt the city by luring the Raiders back to Oakland.
</P>

 _ SF CHRON  
 Genentech Stock Plunges  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shares of Genentech, the South San Francisco biotech leader, took a
pounding yesterday after the firm's Swiss parent said it would sell
as much as 17 percent of its stake to provide investors with a
greater supply of the much-in-demand stock.
<P>
   The surprise move sent Genentech's share price down $15.06 to
close at $157.75, a nearly 9 percent decline from $172.81 on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Roche Holding AG, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant that in June
scooped up the 35 percent of Genentech it didn't already own, will
turn a profit of about $3.4 billion when it sells as many 22
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roche's chief executive, Franz Humer, said in a
statement that the move is intended only ``to provide more
liquidity in Genentech shares requested by the market,'' analysts
see the company having a somewhat more selfish motive.
</P>
<P>
   Roche simply may be seeking to cash in on a 65-percent gain in
Genentech's share price since the stock was offered to the public
in July.
</P>
<P>
   Or the company may be adding to its war chest amid a slew of
lawsuits and fines related to a price-fixing scandal in the vitamin
market. Roche already has agreed to pay a $500 million fine to U.S.
authorities, and is facing a similar probe by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   A third scenario envisions Roche using proceeds from the stock
sale to acquire other biotech or pharmaceutical firms. In any case,
the European conglomerate will maintain a controlling 65 percent
stake in Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts weren't startled that Genentech's stock would lose some
ground after its big run-up in value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genentech is the granddaddy of biotech,'' said Alan Auerbach,
an analyst with First Security Van Kasper in Southern California.
``You've got a huge demand and a limited supply of shares.
Typically, when someone announces a (big sale of shares), you see a
drop in the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Genentech also reported third-quarter earnings yesterday, but
the results were overshadowed by the Roche announcement and it's
not clear what impact they had on the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech posted a net loss of $62.8 million (49 cents per
share) compared to net income of $63.4 million (49 cents) a year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding special charges and taxes related to Roche's
acquisition of Genentech stock, Genentech earned $66.9 million (51
cents) in the most recent quarter. That was way ahead of analysts'
average estimate of 40 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue in the quarter rose 10 percent, to $345.3 million, from
$313.9 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a two-for-one stock split, effective
after Roche sells its shares. The two moves will effectively
quadruple the number of Genentech shares in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   While such developments should be catnip to investors, Robert
Toth, an analyst with Prudential Securities in San Francisco, said
the earnings news was offset by concerns about a pair of cancer
drugs that have largely fueled Genentech's recent advance.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes remain high that Herceptin, for treating breast cancer,
and Rituxan, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, will result in an eventual
windfall for the firm. But Toth said investors may be skittish
about product sales released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Herceptin totaled $40 million in the first quarter and
jumped to $46 million in the second quarter, but registered slower
growth, to $47.9 million, in the most recent three-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Rituxan sales, meanwhile, came in at $57 million in the first
quarter and jumped to $74 million in the second quarter, but dipped
to $72.4 million in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech CEO Art Levinson thinks investors were overreacting to
the quarterly sales numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thinks we're going to be growing sales of any
product at 50 percent every year, they're nuts,'' he said. ``At
some point, you can only be so fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson speculated that investors were more worried yesterday
about Roche's stock sale than about the prospects for Genentech's
top two drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just asking themselves questions about the ability
of the public to take up the new shares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson added that the quadrupling of available shares likely
will have a ``neutral to positive'' impact on Genentech's stock
over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the company has a healthy flow of products in its
pipeline. According to Levinson, Genentech now has three drugs (or
new applications for existing drugs) in Phase II trials, eight
ready for or in Phase III trials, and two others awaiting
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Phase I is when low-dose testing begins on a small group of
human subjects. Phase II involves a larger group and larger doses.
Phase III is the last round of testing prior to seeking a green
light from the government for commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech was founded in 1976 and has remained a dominant player
in the biotech industry. It makes drugs to treat a variety of
conditions, including cancer, heart disease and growth
deficiencies.

   HOUSTON _ Batting heroics from Brian Jordan, fielding heroics
from Walt Weiss and managing heroics from Bobby Cox combined Friday
to help the Atlanta Braves beat Houston, 5-3, in 12 innings and
move one victory away from eliminating the Astros in the division
series.
</P>
<P>
   Driving in all five Atlanta runs, with a three-run homer in the
sixth and a two-run double in the 12th, Jordan was the star of Game
3 at the Astrodome. But Weiss saved the day for Atlanta with a
nifty play at shortstop in the 10th, and Cox resorted to using Greg
Maddux in relief and Kevin Millwood as a closer in order to put his
team up by 2-1 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by the Braves here in game four Saturday _ with John
Smoltz opposing Shane Reynolds, Houston's first-game winner _ would
advance Atlanta to the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's tie-breaking double came off Jeff Powell in the 12th.
The rally began with one out, when Otis Nixon singled to left
field. Bret Boone singled Nixon to second base. Chipper Jones
chopped out to third base, while Nixon and Boone advanced.
</P>
<P>
   With first base open, manager Larry Dierker of the Astros
elected to pitch to Jordan, rather than giving him an intentional
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk him, you load the bases and you still get a pretty
good hitter up there in Andruw Jones,'' Dierker explained after the
game. ``If I'm pitching,'' the former 20-game winner went on,
``that's what I want to do _ pitch to him and make him hit a tough
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   So Powell pitched and Jordan hit a line drive down the right
field line that scored both runners. Cox then turned to Millwood,
who pitched a one-hitter in Game 2 on Wednesday, and the
right-hander retired Houston in order to end a memorable game.

   S&AMP;P 500 GAINS 18 POINTS ON BARGAIN-HUNTING SPREE
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.38 points, or 1.39
percent, to 1,336.02, in reaction to a buying spree by bargain
hunters. The market was also responding to the mixed jobless report
for September. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2 percent last
month, but the report signaled that wages are rising at a
faster-than-expected clip.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 112.71 points, or 1.07
percent, to 10,649.76. The Nasdaq composite index increased 25.87
points, to 2,886.57.

   A LIMIT FOR COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY?
</P>
<P>
   A researcher at Intel contends in the journal Science that
computer technology is reaching a limit for how small silicon chips
can become. The limit would end a phenomenon known as Moore's law,
which says that every 18 months, the number of transistors that
will fit on a silicon chip doubles.
</P>
<P>
   FCC LOOSENS RULES FOR CABLE
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has substantially loosened
the rules that have limited one company from controlling too much
of the cable industry. The decision clears the way for AT&AMP;T to own
more than a third of the United States' franchises offering
subscribers television, telephone and high-speed Internet services,
as well as own major interests in a number of major video producers
and television programmers.
</P>
<P>
   STATE FARM MUST PAY DAMAGES
</P>
<P>
   A state judge in Illinois has decided that State Farm defrauded
policyholders by requiring that damages from auto accidents be
repaired with lower-priced generic parts, and ordered the insurer
to pay $730 million in actual and punitive damages. Earlier in the
week a jury said the insurer breached its contracts with
policyholders by having repair shops use parts that were not
authorized by auto manufacturers. The new verdict brought the total
damages from the case to $1.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ROCHE TO CUT STAKE IN GENENTECH
</P>
<P>
   Genentech said Roche Holdings would reduce its stake in the
company to 65 percent from 82 percent by selling 20 million shares.
Investors sold on the news, driving Genentech's stock down
$15.0625, to $157.75.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZILIAN PRIVATIZATION DISRUPTED
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Minas Gerais state in Brazil, Itamar Franco, who
caused a currency crisis for the country in January, is trying to
sabotage a federal program to privatize state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   NATWEST DISMISSES CHIEF EXECUTIVE
</P>
<P>
   National Westminster dismissed its chief executive, Derek
Wanless, to try to regain investor confidence and thwart a takeover
bid by the Bank of Scotland. The move was expected because
investors had lost confidence in him after several failed attempts
to acquire other companies, including the British insurer Legal and
General Group.
</P>
<P>
   CRUDE-OIL PRICE FALLS ON SUPPLY DATA
</P>
<P>
   The price of crude oil fell $1.55, to $20.90 a barrel, capping a
15 percent decline for the week, following reports of small
increases in oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   IBM SET TO CUT ABOUT 1,000 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   IBM plans to cut up to 10 percent of its personal-computer work
force, or up to 1,000 workers, in a cost-cutting effort to turn
around the division, which lost nearly $1 billion last year. The 5
percent to 10 percent reduction in the work force of 10,000 will
mostly affect marketing employees as the company consolidates its
staff for different brands.
</P>
<P>
   CANADIAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Canada's unemployment rate fell 0.3 percent, to 7.5 percent in
September, the lowest level in over nine years. It is the latest
piece of evidence that suggests Canada's economy is heating up.

 _ SF CHRON  
 California's First Gay Chamber of Commerce Forms
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Loren Stein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Special to the Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Like any entrepreneur starting from scratch, Larry Rosen knew he
needed contacts to build his Redwood City law practice.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosen, who is gay, didn't want to go through the established
networking channels. ``As a gay businessman, I didn't feel
comfortable signing up with the Rotary Club, there's not a lot
there I can relate to,'` he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, who specializes in business litigation, had only
limited success jump-starting his business by putting ads in the
Lavendar pages _ the gay equivalent of the Yellow pages _ and
tapping a gay business organization for leads.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, he hit on the idea for a networking organization to
help gay and lesbian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a few other business owners, he founded the
Rainbow Chamber of Commerce, the first gay chamber of commerce in
California and one of only a handful in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Chamber of Commerce officially opened its doors last
June to gay and lesbian businesses in Santa Clara, San Mateo,
Alameda and Santa Cruz counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is, we're a substantial business community,
we're here, and we want to be strong and effective,'' Rosen said,
the group's president. ``When we asked ourselves what type of
business group does the job best, the answer was a chamber of
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes the chamber designation will give it the
credibility it wants to improve business conditions for its members
as well as clout with public agencies. Such groups can be quite
effective. In San Francisco, for example, the gay business
community is well-represented by the 25-year-old Golden Gate
Business Association, the first professional organization founded
for gay, lesbian and gay-friendly businesses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, there have been mixed opinions about the South
Bay's new gay chamber of commerce. Steve Tedesco, president of the
San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, which represents 2,000
members, has a hard time with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little irritating that three people can get together
and call themselves a chamber of commerce,'' he noted. ``In my
opinion, it's really a trade association (with) like-minded people
coming together to solve their problems and not the problems of the
community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that people aren't loyal to businesses because
they are gay-owned, but because they provide the best products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   Others don't see a problem with it. ``The traditional chamber is
more geographically based,'' said Dave Kilby, vice president of the
California Chamber of Commerce, which represents some 450 chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, name your favorite ethnic or minority group and there's
probably a chamber of commerce out there. It's the way of the
world. We've no problem with it and moreover, we've no authority
over it,'' said Kilby, noting the chamber name is not trademarked
and chambers are not required to belong to an umbrella
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly O'Brien, a Rainbow chamber member who owns Silicon Valley
Appraisal in San Jose, said the organization is definitely needed
to help build a professional community among gay and lesbian
business owners. She said that she personally feels less
self-conscious at gay-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to play the pronoun game,'' she said. ``It's
easier for people who are not completely out of the closet to
patronize gay and lesbian businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   With 17 businesses signed up so far, Rainbow chamber officials
are working to get the word out about their group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of gay business people sitting on the sidelines
asking, `What are you going to do for us?''' Rosen said. '`Once
they join, and we reach critical mass, they'll see the results of
working together cooperatively.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber, which is also open to supportive businesses and the
general public, hopes to get the backing of prominent local
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to go out and sign up the big players in Silicon
Valley: Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Sun,'' said Rosen. ``They need our
business and we need their support.''
</P>
<P>
   There's general agreement in the business community in the South
Bay that there is a large potential market for gay businesses.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, gay business owners and local activists believe the
time is ripe for the South Bay's gay community to begin flexing its
economic and political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike San Francisco's gay community, which is
well-organized, highly visible and concentrated in a relatively
small geographic location, the South Bay gay community is diffused,
lacking a unified voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gay and lesbian business community has been invisible in
terms of political clout, which is really an arena chambers operate
in,'' said Barbara Jones, executive director of the Billy DeFrank
Lesbian &AMP; Gay Community Center in San Jose. ``The best thing about
the chamber starting is that it opens another door for building
alliances across many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gate Business Association, which has 300 members,
including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Pacific Bell and PG&AMP;E, is
encouraging the efforts of the Rainbow Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   '`It'll help gay and lesbian business owners show mainstream
corporations that they're a viable part of the business
community,'' said Golden Gate president Thomas Ray.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the emergence of the South Bay's first gay chamber is
especially important because the region has traditionally been more
conservative. ``Gays and lesbians who work there are more afraid to
come out of the closet for fear of retaliation, against their own
jobs or their clients.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray and other supporters of the chamber say that
conservative sentiment has shifted these days to a more tolerant
climate. They say young Internet and high-tech companies in the
region encourage creativity and tend to be more interested in an
employee's talents than his or her sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gillard, a chamber member and publisher of Out Now News
Magazine and Pipers Vision Marketing and Design in San Jose, said
that along with the group's more traditional functions, the new
group will be a forum to discuss problems of the gay business
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all share in the challenges facing gay business owners,
such as do we come out to our clients or not?'' Gillard said. ``We
need an environment that supports a dialogue on these kinds of
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Chamber of Commerce joins six other official gay and
lesbian chambers in the United States. Three are in Texas; the
others are in Chicago, Phoenix, and Minneapolis. (The Greater San
Diego Business Association also refers to itself as the city's gay
chamber of commerce.) According to the heads of both the Houston
and Chicago chambers, there has been virtually no backlash or
opposition to their work.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Houston Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce was one
of the first chambers ``brave enough to use the name,'' said
founding president Coy Tow. ``We've had an overwhelmingly
supportive response,'' he said. Started in 1995, it now has 350
members, including Chase Bank, Shell Oil, and Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Boyer, co-chair of the 300-member Chicago Area Gay &AMP;
Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber name ``has been a
huge benefit to us, it's immeasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other chamber presidents in the South Bay warn that there's hard
work ahead for the Rainbow chamber not so much because of its
novelty, but because it covers four counties.
</P>
<P>
   '`They'll have their work cut out for them, like any chamber,
but particularly because of their broad reach geographically,''
says Susan Frank, president of the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce.
'`I wish them well.''  &QL;

BEYOND TESTING: FIVE SENATORS' VIEWS ON U.S. ROLE IN WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Del., Miss., Okla., N.Y.)   (with TEST-BAN-TREATY)  
(editors: selected excerpts may be used as sidebars) 
(bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are comments from five senators during
the arguments presented Friday for and against the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEN. JON KYL, R-ARIZ. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to talk a little bit about a common thread of many of
the people who are in opposition to the treaty here, a common
thread of their remarks here this morning. And that is that it is
difficult for the United States to sustain our position as the
world leader, and many in the international community would find it
objectionable if the United States rejected the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, and that this would hurt our ability to lead with
respect to proliferation of nuclear weapons. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The world community, which does not want the United States to
develop a ballistic missile defense, which doesn't want the United
States to do anything that would require an amendment to the A.B.M.
Treaty, and some of which is very much in favor of total nuclear
disarmament and has agreed to participate in this treaty only after
leaders promised them that this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would
be one of several key steps toward nuclear disarmament _ all of
those people in the world, I submit, are not people that we want to
make United States national defense policy. Their goals are not the
same as our goals.
</P>
<P>
   We have an obligation, as the leader of the free world, to
insure that our nuclear deterrent is safe and reliable. They don't.
</P>
<P>
   We may have to do things that they could never dream of doing,
including nuclear testing to insure the safety and reliability of
our nuclear stockpile. They don't have to worry about that. But we
do. . . .
</P>
<P>
   So I frankly don't care much if people around the world who
don't want us to defend ourselves against ballistic missile attack
are going to criticize us for rejecting a flawed, unverifiable,
ineffective C.T.B.T. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Just close with this point: The whole world thought that Ronald
Reagan was wrong, that he had left his senses when he said ``No''
to Mikhail Gorbachev at Reykjavik. They both talked about trying to
rid the world of nuclear weapons. But when Gorbachev said the price
of that agreement was that the United States would have to forego
the development of the Strategic Defense Initiative, Reagan said
no. All of the world leaders gasped except Margaret Thatcher. But
the rest of the world leaders gasped. They said, Mr. President, you
should reconsider that. And all of the arms control advocates said
this was a bad mistake for President Reagan to have said no.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it later transpires, George Shultz mentions the fact
that Mikhail Gorbachev told him that that was the turning point in
the cold war. That's when Gorbachev concluded that he could not win
the cold war. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, in calling the Soviet Union the Evil Empire,
upset a lot of the world leaders. But he stood his ground. And
history has proven him correct. . . .
</P>
<P>
   SEN. TRENT LOTT, R-MISS.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last two days, in hearings before the Armed Services
Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, it's become apparent
that this treaty is flawed _ should not be ratified, now or in the
foreseeable future. When you look at the testimony of the country's
three nuclear weapons laboratories' leaders yesterday, it makes it
very clear that as far as safety and reliability without testing,
at this time we do not have the ability to make sure that they are
safe and that it should be, would be reliable if there was a need
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The headline even in The New York Times says, ``Experts Say Test
Ban May Impair Nuclear-Arms Safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. President, that is a fact, and that is a scary fact. Do the
American people want us to have nuclear arms that are not tested,
that are not safe? I don't think so. And so I think we need to be
very careful about going forward with a treaty that has the
problems that this treaty has now in terms of what it would do, the
fact that we don't have the ability to detect or verify what other
countries may be doing.
</P>
<P>
   Just this past week the C.I.A. said, you know, they couldn't
guarantee that they could detect low-level testing in Russia. And
then you add to that the testimony of the labs' experts. So we
should _ we should defeat this treaty. . . .
</P>
<P>
   SEN. JOSEPH BIDEN, D-DEL.
</P>
<P>
   I have real questions about my colleagues' concern about the
stockpile stewardship _ that it cannot work. Our scientists are the
best in the world. They know what they're doing. They define
scientific challenges that must meet the military performance and
reliability standards. And after defining these challenges, they
believe they can meet them.
</P>
<P>
   I believe they know what they're talking about. But I see one
problem. The one problem the stockpile stewardship faces _ now and
in the future _ that's the problem that some may not fund it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I find it kind of interesting: the very people who stand up here
and say, as I happen to believe, that they have confidence that our
scientists in the future are going to be able to shoot out of the
sky, like a bullet meeting a bullet, incoming nuclear weapons over
the ocean traveling at multi-thousand miles per hour. And do it
with certainty and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   They have faith in the ability of that to occur, but they don't
have faith in the ability of our scientists at the three
laboratories who say they are well on their way to doing that, to
be able to do what they say they need. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Let's be fair. You can't have it both ways. I would respectfully
submit: the ability to guarantee that MIRV nuclear warheads fired
in the hundreds or the thousands at the United States could be
blown out of the sky with impunity by a missile defense initiative
on our part is (a) greater scientific feat than what the stockpile
requires. . . .
</P>
<P>
   SEN. JAMES INHOFE, R-OKLA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senator from Delaware was talking about our allies. And I am
very sensitive to our allies. And our allies have signed this
treaty. ``So if our allies have signed this treaty, we've got to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm not concerned about our allies. I'm concerned about
our adversaries. I'm not at all concerned that Great Britain's
going to send a missile over the United States. I am concerned
about China and Russia and now North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   You know, right now, as we speak, the President is sending money
and making promises to North Korea so that they will not test a
missile that they have called a Taepodong 2 that will reach
Washington, D.C., from any place in the world, take 35 minutes to
get over here, and we don't have any defense against this thing.
And so those are the ones I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Have they ratified this treaty? No.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not China, not Russia, not North Korea. . . .
</P>
<P>
   During one of the hearings, we had Secretary Cohen _ and let me
start off by saying there's no one I respect more highly than
Secretary Bill Cohen, our Secretary of Defense. . . . But I do have
to say this: That he has certainly changed his story since he was
in the United States Senate. I'm going to quote what Secretary
Cohen said in 1992, when at that time he was the most vigorous
opponent of a ban on nuclear testing that we had in the United
States Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This is Secretary Bill Cohen when he was a Senator: ``Many of
these nuclear weapons which we intend to keep in our stockpile for
the indefinite future are dangerously unsafe'' _ you want to put
that chart up _ ``are dangerously unsafe. Equally relevant is the
fact that we can make these weapons much safer if limited testing
is allowed to be conducted. So when crafting our policy regarding
nuclear testing, this should be our principal objective: to make
the weapons we retain safe. The amendment that was adopted last
week'' _ I'm speaking 1992 _ ``the amendment banning testing does
not meet this test because it would not permit the Department of
Energy to conduct the necessary testing to make our weapons safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, when I ask that question, there is some suggestion that
maybe we're talking about different weapons. But we're not talking
about different weapons. These are the nine weapons we're talking
about today. These same nine weapons were there in 1992, the same
ones that Secretary Cohen had alluded to. . . .
</P>
<P>
   SEN. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   I was Ambassador to India in 1974 when the Indians set off what
they called a peaceful nuclear explosion. And they intended it as
such. In conversations with Prime Minister (Indira) Gandhi, she was
persuasive that they were not going to build a bomb. They simply
wanted to establish that they had the capacity to do so.
</P>
<P>
   It was a matter of prestige. It was a matter of reminding
Westerners that Indian physicists had been as much a part of the
great era of discovery at the turn of the century as had any
Europeans, and more than any Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades go by, a quarter century goes by, the Congress Party
with its universalist tendencies and professions has gone into a
minority. A new party, a Hindu party as it would call itself, the
B.J.P., came to power in March of 1998 and two months later, Mr.
President, India set off five, a series of five nuclear explosions.
That was followed almost instantly with Pakistan doing the same. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   Here an important distinction is to be made: In India, to its
great credit, the nuclear development is a matter directly under
the control of the Prime Minister and is not under the control of
the military. The Indian military have been very apolitical, kept
out of politics and have followed the civilian command from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Not so Pakistan. The Pakistan bomb is in the armaments of the
Pakistan military.
</P>
<P>
   And here, sir, if I could make a point, in which I do not assert
absolute confidence but I believe this is a shared judgment: It's
not clear that Indian tests last year were successful. They
probably did not achieve a hydrogen bomb that they proclaimed. . .
. They want to test more. . . . They need to, as it were, show the
Pakistanis that they have the weapons that they've claimed to have.
</P>

   And in turn the Pakistanis will respond, and you have this
ratcheting up at the same time. Pakistan, not a stable country, not
a country with civil authority very secure, and an impoverished
country _ that country will be selling nuclear weapons. And sir,
they will be selling them to the Middle East. A Saudi prince who
has most recently visited Pakistan was shown nuclear facilities. We

MAYBE FISHER'S PLAY WILL GROW ON JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Patience and three years of
dive-across-the-court dedication have put Derek Fisher in position
to be the Los Angeles Lakers' starting point guard. Three inches
might deny him that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers' most experienced point man and one of the team's
hardest workers, Fisher seems an obvious choice. It's why he was
given a seven-year, $24 million contract this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Phil Jackson prefers his guards be about 6-4 or taller
to avoid having to switch defensive assignments or give up height
against the Gary Paytons of the league. Fisher and second-year
guard Tyronn Lue (6-0) could be, ahem, sold short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tyronn and I were joking around about it yesterday, that we
won't grow four inches before the season starts,'' Fisher said
Friday at training camp. ``The only thing we can control is how
hard we play and what we go out there and do, and that's all we're
going to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it seems, so good. Jackson has singled out Fisher for
praise and remains noncommittal about the lineup. And for what it's
worth, during a halfcourt scrimmage earlier this week, Fisher
played on a unit with the other starters.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is considering a backcourt of 6-7 Kobe Bryant and
6-7 Rick Fox and still hopes to have former Chicago Bulls guard Ron
Harper, who is 6-6, signed by the time camp ends Monday.
</P>
<P>
   History shows Jackson is open-minded. He played 6-2 B.J.
Armstrong in Chicago. And he said playing full-court defense can
balance out any height issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the coach asks me to do or needs from me that's what
I'm willing to do,'' Fisher said. ``That's just the way I've always
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher began last season as the starter, but coach Del Harris
had Derek Harper finish games, then made him the starter. Fisher
regained the starting job by the end of the season and showed
promise in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   All he wants now is a clear role, whatever it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that, over the years, the team's success is most
important, and wherever my role fits into that, I'm cool with,'' he
said. ``If they feel like with Ron (Harper)'s height and his
experience and knowing the offense, he needs to start, I'm fine
with that. I'll play behind this guy, he's got championship
experience. I'll continue to learn. This is only my fourth year. I
don't concern myself with all those things. As long as I know where
I stand.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Time to play: For the first time this week, the Lakers held a
fullcourt scrimmage, with referees, Friday night. As with all
practices, it was closed to the media, but the scrimmage promised
to be the best test yet of how proficient the Lakers have become at
running the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be kind of crazy,'' Robert Horry said earlier in
the day. ``It's going to be kind of hectic. We're still getting it.
There's still things they're trying to get us to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster reduced: Rookie guard Melvin Levett, acquired from
Detroit in the Derek Harper trade, was released Friday at his own
request. Levett, a long shot to make the roster, wanted a chance to
win a job elsewhere, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Levett made the team, the Lakers would have owed the Pistons
a second-round draft choice because Derek Harper is expected to
retire rather than play for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' roster now stands at 18 players.

 &HT;    Koch lawsuit: Unlawful business practices or family squabbling?
 &HT;    By Fred Cohen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ The latest courtroom battle between America's Cup
champion yacht racer William I. Koch and his brothers' $35 billion
company began here this week with testimony by former employees who
said they had systematically cheated producers that sold oil to
Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   William Koch, 59, filed the suit a decade ago against the
Wichita, Kan.-based company led by his two billionaire brothers on
behalf of the federal government and Indian tribes. The trial is
expected to last until December.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges Koch Industries falsified measurements during
the 1980s in 13 states to skim oil it bought from independent
producers.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement Monday, Plaintiffs' lawyer Roy Morrow
Bell of San Diego said Koch Industries stole a total of $230
million in oil over 10 years. A small part of that was produced
under federal and Indian leases, the only oil at issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief trial lawyer, Clyde Muchmore of Oklahoma
City, said company's maximum damages are ``a few hundred thousand
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the company faces possible civil penalties of
$5,000 to $10,000 per month, per lease, for each time the jury
finds that the company wrongfully reported production to the
government. More than 2,000 leases and at least a three-year period
are involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   William Koch, already worth about $650 million, according to
Forbes magazine, sued under a whistle blower-type law that allows
him to collect as much as a third of any award to the plaintiffs.
Both sides deny the case is primarily about money.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is about the process of determining how much
oil was in the tanks of producers the company bought oil from. On
another level, the parties say, it's about the reputation of the
nation's second-largest privately-held company and the family n

</P>
<P>
   William Koch, already worth about $650 million, according to
Forbes magazine, sued under a whistle blower-type law that allows
him to collect as much as a third of any award to the plaintiffs.
Both sides deny the case is primarily about money.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is about the process of determining how much
oil was in the tanks of producers the company bought oil from. On
another level, the parties say, it's about the reputation of the
nation's second-largest privately-held company and the family name
of its founder.
</P>
<P>
   But to many observers within the industry, it is little more
than ``sibling rivalry on a very high financial level,'' said
Mickey Thompson, executive vice president of the Oklahoma
Independent Petroleum Association, a producers' group.
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries calls the case part of an ``ongoing vendetta
against our company'' by William Koch, who was fired after a failed
attempt to wrest control from his brother Charles in 1980. William
sold back his shares, then filed a barrage of mostly futile
lawsuits against the company and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``William Koch's history of unsuccessful litigation against Koch
Industries has thus far occupied the time of 27 state and federal
judges,'' the company said in a June press release.
</P>
<P>
   What gives the two sides room to continue arguing in this latest
case is the complicated and indirect way the amount of the oil in a
producer's tank is determined. An employee of the company buying
the oil takes about a half-dozen readings and measurements. The
information goes into a computer, which calculates the amount of
the oil and its value.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses who testified for William Koch's side said they
routinely recorded measurements rounded or inflated to favor Koch
Industries _ unless someone was watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (would) intentionally write down something other than
what they see,'' plaintiffs' lawyer Bell said in his opening. ``And
they will tell you in their case that they call that adjustments.
(T)he adjustments is the skimming. They're taking oil off the top,
keeping it and are not paying for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries' Muchmore agreed company employees made
adjustments. But he said the employees _ called ``gaugers'' _ who
took the readings always worked out any adjustments with the
``pumpers'' who managed the wells for producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the joint responsibility of the gauger and the pumper to
see to it that the measurements are acceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the gauger were to cheat, Muchmore said, the pumper would
catch him. ``He can check the oil before the gauger comes. He will
always check it after. He has the right to be there if he's
concerned about any problem with the oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bell downplayed the amount of protection pumpers
provide. The opportunity to cheat ``is ever-present in the gas and
oil business because it's impractical, not economical, perhaps not
even reasonable, to check all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association's Thompson said,
``There is a lot of trust in the way oil is bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson agrees with Koch Industries that producers and
their pumpers would have caught any widespread cheating, and he
called William Koch's case a farce. ``If he's got a case, where are
the aggrieved producers lined up on his side? Where's the beef?''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson echoed Koch Industries' line that any producer who
thought Koch Industries was cheating had many other potential
buyers. ``There is huge, intense competition'' among oil
purchasers, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Koch Industries remains a major purchaser nationally,
buying half a million barrels of day, it sold its pipeline
operations in Oklahoma and no longer buys crude oil in the state.
The plaintiffs acknowledge that any cheating by Koch Industries on
measurement ended in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Both those factors have diminished interest in the case here,
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The four Koch brothers inherited a fortune generated by the
second-biggest privately held company in the United States, after
grain giant Cargill. The low-profile conglomerate operates oil
refineries in Texas and Minnesota and pipelines and engages in
numerous other businesses, from cattle to asphalt to specialty
chemicals used in the manufacture of microchips.
</P>
<P>
   The last time William Koch squared off against the company, in a
federal case tried in Topeka, Kan., last year the amount at issue
was $2 billion. William and his older brother Frederick lost their
claim that the company had cheated them and other shareholders when
it bought their stock in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In a story this summer, The New York Times shed new light on the
scope of that battle, reporting that investigators working for
William Koch had ``infiltrated'' the press corps to try to
influence coverage and posed as journalists to try to obtain
confidential information about Koch Industries.
</P>
<P>
   The story also reported that people working for William Koch
said they were followed and harassed by investigators on the
company's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   William's fraternal twin brother, David, is an executive vice
president of the company. He is closely allied with Charles, 63,
who lives quietly in Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   Though on opposite sides of the family fault line, both twins
have oceanfront estates in Palm Beach, Fla. William heads the West
Palm Beach-based Oxbow Corp., a privately held group of
international energy, engineering and real estate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   William is perhaps best known for winning the America's Cup
yacht race in 1992, at a cost to him of $68 million. He later sold
his three International America's Cup Class yachts and used the
proceeds to fund a foundation that provides grants to sailing
training programs.
</P>
<P>
   William has been active in politics, attending a 1998
fund-raiser for Vice President Al Gore and hosting this month a
$1,000-a-plate fund raiser for Ted Kennedy. That no doubt would
have horrified his father, Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, who
was a founding member of the John Birch Society.
</P>
<P>
   David, a supporter of conservative think tanks and foundations,
ran for vice president of the United States in 1980 on the
Libertarian Party ticket. Koch Industries was a major contributor
to the 1998 presidential campaign of Robert Dole, the Kansas
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Charles, who lives in Wichita, William and David appear

OIL PRICES DROP MORE, BUT TREND IS SEEN AS TEMPORARY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Crude-oil prices fell nearly 7 percent Friday, registering a 15
percent decline for the week, after hitting a 33-month high the
previous week. The volatile performance reflected reports of small
increases in oil supply.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts cautioned, however, that the price drop appeared
to be premature and did not indicate fundamental changes in supply
or any lack of resolve by major oil-producing countries to keep
their cutbacks in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't find a fundamental reason why crude oil has dropped
like this,'' said Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was no evidence that the major oil producers were
easing up on their cuts, even though several surveys showed this
week that production among major countries of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries showed a small increase in output for
September.
</P>
<P>
   The increases were so minor, he said, that they could not be
considered evidence that producers were cheating on the cutback
plan.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that crude-oil prices would recover and could be as
high as $30 a barrel by the end of the year, because growth in
demand was strong while supplies have not been increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for November delivery dropped 6.9 percent Friday in
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, falling $1.55, to
$20.90 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Brent crude oil for November delivery fell $1.38, or
6.3 percent, to $20.70 a barrel on the International Petroleum
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, Leuffer said, was related to concerns by oil
traders who have been looking for reasons to take profits, and thus
reacted to the failure of oil prices to go above the $25 level.
</P>
<P>
   Selling by speculative commodity funds has been a major reason
prices have dropped so suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   In such an atmosphere even the small increase in production by
OPEC nations last month had a big effect on the futures market.
</P>
<P>
   There was also concern among traders that Mexico, Saudi Arabia
and Venezuela, in their meeting next month in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
might decide to increase crude-oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Tellez, the energy minister for Mexico, said Friday,
however, that the group would reaffirm its agreement of earlier
this year to cut crude-oil output by about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That cutback and the recovery of demand, particularly in Asia,
have been leading factors in the doubling of crude-oil prices since
early last year.
</P>
<P>
   World inventories of oil have also fallen considerably while
demand has continued to be robust.

GEN. BRUCE K. HOLLOWAY, 87, HEAD OF STRATEGIC AIR COMMAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Tenn.)  (ko) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Bruce K. Holloway, who shot down 13 Japanese planes in
World War II flying a propeller fighter, then oversaw the giant jet
bombers of the Strategic Air Command, America's nuclear strike
force, a quarter-century later, died on Sept. 30 at his home in
Orlando, Fla. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway flew against the Japanese in China as commander of the
23rd Fighter Group, the successor unit to Gen. Claire L.
Chennault's Flying Tiger volunteer force. Soon after World War II
ended, Holloway commanded the Air Force's first jet-fighter outfit.
In the Vietnam War, he was commander in chief of the Strategic Air
Command, whose eight-engine B-52s, equipped to carry nuclear bombs,
flew conventional bombing missions in support of U.S. and South
Vietnamese troops.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Keener Holloway, a native of Knoxville, Tenn., studied
engineering for two years at the University of Tennessee before
entering West Point. He graduated in 1937, received his pilot's
wings a year later, then served with a fighter unit in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1942, he went to China for fighter missions with the
Flying Tigers, Americans who flew P-40s with distinctive
tigershark-teeth markings in missions against the Japanese while
under contract to the government of Chiang Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway was formally an observer on his missions until the
Flying Tigers were absorbed into the 14th Air Force in July 1942.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 27, 1942, Holloway, then a major, flew in support of a
bombing raid on Canton, China, in which 23 Japanese planes were
shot down without the loss of a single U.S. plane.
</P>
<P>
   He downed a Japanese Zero fighter with his first burst of fire
that day, was thought to have shot down another fighter in a
dogfight and then destroyed a Japanese bomber.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1943, he replaced Gen. Robert L. Scott Jr.,
remembered for his wartime memoir, ``God Is My Co-Pilot,'' as
commander of the 23rd Fighter Group. Scott, one of America's most
celebrated fighter pilots, said later that ``General Holloway did
an even better job leading the group into combat and shot down just
as many planes as I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway returned to the United States in 1944 after being shot
down on a mission and making his way back to his base. In New York
in March 1945, he said he had been ``almost killed'' by the Chinese
``with hospitality.'' He recalled how, on his trek back to his
base, the mayor of every town he passed through had insisted on
dining with him. ``What with the wine I drank, I was careful to
pick the broadest horse available to ride away on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II ended, Holloway became commander of the 412th
Fighter Group at March Field, Calif., America's first jet-fighter
outfit, flying Lockheed Shooting Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who received his first star in 1953, was named deputy
commander of the U.S. Strike Command, at MacDill Air Force Base in
Florida, in 1961, assumed command of the U.S. Air Forces in Europe
in 1965 and became vice chief of staff of the Air Force in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the Strategic Air Command from 1968 to 1972,
Holloway oversaw more than 1,000 intercontinental ballistic
missiles and 500 long-range jet bombers, which by 1971 provided 85
percent of the American strategic nuclear strength. Holloway was
also head of a multiservice staff that provided the president with
war plans by listing potential targets and suggesting what weapons
might be used for each.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, who retired from military service in 1972, received
the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, the Legion of
Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Frances; three daughters, Candace
Boyce and Amy Bunger, both of Memphis, and Taylor McMaster of
Lincoln, Neb., and four grandchildren.

 N.J. LEGISLATORS SEEK GREATER DISASTER RELIEF FOR REGION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In short order, a summer drought and a
late-summer tropical storm dealt a punishing one-two punch to the
Northeast. Now they are challenging the federal government's
traditional ways of responding to disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., has complained in Congress that
Northeastern farmers are not getting their fair share of drought
relief, compared with aid that other parts of the country have
received for past catastrophes. Two New Jersey colleagues, Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, also a Democrat, and Rep. Marge Roukema, a
Republican, have taken up the cause of small-business owners, wiped
out by the floods after Tropical Storm Floyd, who say that the
system has a blind spot for their problems.
</P>
<P>
   But these calls for greater and more focused help come as
federal officials are trying to get a tighter rein on disaster
spending, which has grown exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has generally been very supportive,'' said Jane
Bullock, staff director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
which coordinates disaster aid. ``But we have seen a growing
concern about spending in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaints from New Jersey lawmakers join a growing chorus
of need that federal disaster officials and congressional sources
say they have heard in recent years after each new disaster, from
the Midwestern floods in 1993 and the Northridge, Calif.,
earthquake in 1994, to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and
Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico and on the Gulf Coast last year.
These emergencies have swelled the need for the package of cash
grants, business loans and emergency cleanup assistance that the
agency offers local and state governments when the president
declares a disaster, Ms. Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has received $19.1 billion in supplemental
appropriations to respond to an array of disasters since 1993. In
the previous 19 years, according to the Congressional Research
Service, supplemental disaster relief totaled just $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by the research service this year said that because
such spending has contributed to Congress' exceeding the
discretionary spending caps that it set for itself, it has also
started a debate over just how to define an emergency in a way that
would stabilize spending. Efforts in the last four sessions of
Congress have failed to put the brakes on the willingness to
appropriate more and more for disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   And now New Jersey lawmakers are proposing what Ms. Bullock
calls the first real expansion of FEMA's role since the agency was
organized in 1979. Next week they plan to introduce a bill that
would authorize FEMA to offer cash grants of up to $50,000 to small
businesses trying to rebuild after the September storm. Under
federal law the businesses are eligible only for low-interest
loans; grants are available only to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``FEMA should be able to make the same grants to help get small
businesses back on their feet as they do for homeowners,'' Ms.
Roukema said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's prime sponsors include Ms. Roukema and Rep. Eva
Clayton, D-N.C. They describe the measure as ``one-time grants for
this one-time disaster'' _ in the same spirit, they say, as the
appropriations for other disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the storm, business owners in central New Jersey
communities like Bound Brook and Manville have staged angry
protests, saying that loans are inadequate for merchants who are
already too far in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would offer grants to replace up to
half of the uninsured contents or inventory of a business, and
would require recipients to maintain flood insurance. Recipients
would not be eligible for any future disaster grant program, and
businesses could not use grants to relocate outside the community.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Torricelli and other lawmakers are seeking money
specially earmarked for farmers in the Northeastern and Middle
Atlantic states, many of whom were hit by both the drought and the
floods.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers are threatening a filibuster to derail a House and
Senate leadership agreement that would allocate $1.2 billion in
direct aid to farmers across the country. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture estimates that New Jersey farmers suffered $2 billion
in losses and damage from the drought alone.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said he sees a ``geographical bias'' that has steered
aid to other states.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, he recited a litany of emergency
appropriations for crop losses that he and other lawmakers had
voted for over the years, sending hundreds of millions of dollars
to Texas, Illinois, North Dakota, Iowa and Missouri. In each case,
he said, his state and region only received tiny fractions of those
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I voted for the package nonetheless,'' he said. ``Because
farmers in the Midwest needed it, and it was right to provide them
with adequate relief.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For more than three decades, Moore's Law has
been an unshakable principle for the computer industry: every 18
months, the number of transistors that will fit on a silicon chip
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Named for semiconductor pioneer and Intel co-founder Gordon
Moore, who first stated it in 1965, the phenomenon has been the
foundation of the computer revolution and the rise of the Internet.
As transistors have been scaled ever smaller, computing performance
has risen exponentially while the cost of that power has been
driven down. And it has been assumed in the industry that the rate
of progress would hold for at least another 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But now a researcher at Intel, the world's leading chip company,
has reported glimpsing a potentially insurmountable barrier to the
advance of Moore's Law much closer at hand, perhaps early in the
coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the journal Science, the Intel scientist, Paul
A. Packan, says it is not clear whether the most common type of
silicon transistor can be scaled down beyond the generation of
chips that will begin to appear next year, because semiconductor
engineers have not found ways around basic physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fundamental issues have not previously limited the
scaling of transistors,'' he wrote in the Sept. 24 issue. ``There
are currently no known solutions to these problems,'' he added,
calling it ``the most difficult challenge the semiconductor
industry has ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Allison, a Silicon Valley physicist and computer
designer, said: ``The fact that this warning comes from Intel's
process group is really significant. This says that they see actual
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Intel scientist will be echoed by researchers
from the University of Glasgow in a paper to be presented in
December at a conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Without further advances in the miniaturization of silicon-based
transistors, hopes for continued progress would have to be based on
technologies that are promising but unproved: new materials, new
transistor designs and advances like molecular computing, in which
single molecules act as digital on-off switches.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such dire warnings have been made periodically in
the past _ an article in Scientific American in 1987 said Moore's
Law was unlikely to be maintained through the 1990s _ and each time
semiconductor designers have shown remarkable ingenuity to surmount
seemingly impossible barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Moore's Law proved to be understated; Moore had to
revise his initial prediction of 24 months for each doubling of
chip capacity. And while it is not an actual physical law, his
observation has taken on an almost mystical quality as the clearest
expression of the power of human science and engineering and many
industry executives have come to see it as a self-fulfilling
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the advances described by Moore's Law have
had an accelerating impact on the personal computer industry,
driving the cost of desktop machines down from $3,000 to as low as
$500 while increasing their power.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The inventors of the original semiconductor design technology
are for the most part still bullish about extending that progress,
whatever the immediate hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically the economic incentives to find new methods for
device improvement have regularly overcome the predicted scaling
limits,'' said John Moussouris, a physicist and semiconductor
designer. ``The physical challenges may be getting harder, but the
people and financial resources to surmount them are also growing
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time the global semiconductor industry is
grappling with transistors so small that the placement of
individual atoms will soon become crucial.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the current generation of semiconductors, the
wires that interconnect transistors are etched as fine as 0.18
micron _ 1/500 the width of a human hair _ and the individual
insulating layers that are inside a transistor may be only four or
five atoms thick.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor factories in Japan plan to begin mass production
of chips based on widths of 0.13 micron early next year, and such
chips should be in widespread use within two years. But beyond that
generation, the industry's leading researchers acknowledge there
remain far more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be widths of 0.1 micron, a milestone that in
the Moore's Law progression would be expected three to five years
from now. But at that scale, Packan writes, transistors will be
composed of fewer than 100 atoms, and statistical variations in
this Lilliputian world are beyond the ability of semiconductor
engineers to control.
</P>
<P>
   Packan said he had written the Science article to challenge the
industry and academia to focus on areas where breakthroughs are
needed. ``For the last 30 years we've been engineering the device,
and now what's required is fundamental science,'' he said in a
telephone interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Intel executives cautioned against reading too much gloom into
their technical papers, saying that while they did not yet have
precise engineering solutions for breaking the 0.1 micron barrier,
they were confident that answers would be found.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They suggested that part of the reason for Intel's recent
pessimism might have more to do with the need for corporate secrecy
than the arrival of fundamental technical limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face serious challenges,'' said Mark Bohr, an Intel
technology development director and co-author of an internal Intel
technical paper that enumerates the company's unsolved problems.
``We all have ideas to address some of these problems and
admittedly they are iffy and not fully developed, and you don't
want to tip your cards too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And Carver Mead, a physicist and a pioneer in semiconductor
design, says he still adheres to what has been the conventional
industry wisdom, suggesting that Moore's Law will continue to
account for the pace of silicon technology advances until at least
2014. ``There are still some open issues,'' he said. ``and so the
Chicken Little sky-is-falling articles are a recurring theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Heath, a chemistry professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles who is a co-inventor of the Carbon 60
molecule known as the Buckyball, said the industry might be overly
optimistic because it has such a vast investment in today's silicon
technology.
</P>
<P>
   With researchers at Hewlett Packard, Heath has developed a
prototype memory cell the size of a single molecule that operates
on different principles than today's semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their optimism for being able to continue until 2014
is not very realistic,'' he said. ``When you get to very, very
small sizes, you are limited by relying on only a handful of
electrons to describe the difference between on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at IBM, which along with Intel and Motorola is one of
the nation's dominant chip makers, conceded that it may be accurate
to warn of an impending limit to the shrinking of today's dominant
chips, known as CMOs, or complimentary metal oxide semiconductors.
But they said they believed they had found an alternative approach,
known as silicon-on-insulator, that held great promise at
dimensions of 0.1 micron and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``This paper is quite consistent with work we've published,''
said Randall Isaac, vice president for systems technology and
science at IBM's Watson Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. ``But
when a given technology saturates, it is usually replaced by a new
one.''

CLINTON ADMITS DEFEAT, ASKS DELAY ON TEST BAN TREATY VOTE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ President Clinton conceded temporary defeat Friday for
a global nuclear test ban treaty and condemned Senate Republicans
for playing politics on a critical issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton formally asked the Senate to postpone a ratification
vote just hours after the Senate opened debate on the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A vote was set for Tuesday, but supporters remained far short of
the 67 votes needed for ratification. They remained hopeful,
however, that final consideration would be postponed either through
parliamentary delaying tactics or &UR;  &LR; with the consent of Republican
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The votes, said Clinton, ``are simply not there.'' The treaty
has the support of all 45 Democrats but only two of 55 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the first of 154 world leaders to sign the treaty two
years ago, faced a major foreign policy setback by withdrawing the
test ban. Administration officials also fear the lack of
endorsement from the Senate will stymie ratification by other
nations, especially new nuclear powers India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, trying to keep the treaty alive, called on the Senate
to ``reach an agreement to delay the vote and to establish an
orderly process _ a nonpolitical, orderly process, to
systematically deal with all the issues that are out there and to
take whatever time is necessary to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president adamantly rejected demands by conservative
Republicans, led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that Clinton in writing request
the withdrawal of the treaty from the Senate calendar and pledge
not to seek another vote until Clinton steps down in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they want me to give them a letter to cover the political
decision they have made that this does severe damage to the
interest of the United States and the interest of nonproliferation
in the world? I don't think so,'' Clinton retorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't tie the Senate up or themselves up in knots
thinking that some letter from me will somehow obscure from the
American people next year the reality that they have run the risk
of putting America on the wrong side of the proliferation issue for
the first time in 50 years,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart later tried to soften
Clinton's statement, saying ``his intention was not to rule out
sending a letter.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In Washington, meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., who was still negotiating a possible postponement of the
vote late Friday with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
suggested that Clinton efforts to delay a vote might be better
served if he would simply ``pipe down.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Joining the debate on the Senate floor, Lott said he found it
ironic that the president ``has been demanding (a vote on the
treaty) for two years'' and has now suddenly discovered ``that the
votes aren't there'' to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's right,'' said Lott, who opposes it. ``This treaty is
not going to happen. It's not going to be ratified.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lott said he was ``very worried'' that a postponement of the
vote would allow Clinton to use it for ``political purposes'' in
next year's elections against Republicans. Nonetheless, Lott told
reporters later that he was still willing to listen to arguments in
favor of a delay. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Daschle, calling the move toward a vote next week
``pigheaded,'' said if Lott refuses to put it off Democrats will
try to force a postponement by moving for a vote to put it aside.
Such a move would require the support of 51 senators to prevail,
but Daschle said he believes at least six Republicans will join
with the Senate's 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's comments on the floor sparked an angry outburst from Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations
Committee. Biden accused Lott of playing politics with the treaty
by scheduling a vote on it before the foreign relations panel ``has
even held one hearing on it.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; There have been limited hearings on the treaty before other
Senate committees in recent days. But foreign relations, Biden
pointed out, is supposed to have jurisdiction over arms control
matters. He suggested that Republican leaders had sought to avoid
hearings and a vote on the treaty until they were certain it would
not pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break ... Come on,'' Biden shouted. ``This is a
stacked deck.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton: ``This whole thing is about politics. It's about:
`Burn us (supporters) in 1999, because we (GOP) are against a
treaty that 80 percent of the American people support; but please
don't burn us (GOP) again in 2000.' It's political,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is intended to eliminate nuclear test explosions
worldwide. But opponents fear the United States would be unable to
adequately monitor low-level test ban violations by other nations
and would also be prevented from improving and modernizing its own
nuclear arsenal without the benefit of tests. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But supporters contend the treaty requires on-site inspections
and establishes 321 new monitoring stations around the world. They
also contend current technology &UR;  &LR;  allows the U.S. stockpile to be
tested through computer simulation instead of actual tests. The
United States has operated under a self-imposed test moratorium
since 1992. &UR;

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore assembled his political
high command for a meeting at his residence at the Naval
Observatory last April 23, prospects for his presidential campaign
were looking good. Fund raising was on target. Polls showed him
comfortably ahead of former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Gore's advisers, noting that Bradley seemed to be
making headway with disaffected Democrats and independents, urged
the vice president to take on the challenger before he gained
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   White House pollster Mark Penn wrote in a memorandum distributed
at the meeting and reviewed by The New York Times: ``Stop the free
ride for Bradley. His favorability is growing. And we are letting
him get his message out. The campaign must attack everything he
says and does.''
</P>
<P>
   When the group reassembled May 11, there was another memo from
Penn, this one recommending that campaign officials _ not surrogate
speakers _ attack Bradley directly. The suggested theme: ``All talk
_ no leadership. Big talk _ no ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   But after intense debates, Gore concluded that any mention of
Bradley would only give his rival more attention. Even Penn went
along with the consensus, according to many participants, persuaded
that Gore was safely ahead of Bradley in the horse-race polls. So
the vice president ignored Bradley for several months. Behaving as
if he were already the Democratic nominee, Gore saved his critiques
for the Republican front runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until last week that Gore uttered Bradley's name and
refocused his campaign on beating back Bradley. He replaced Penn
and other advisers. And now, several people who played influential
roles in the Gore operation say the failure to engage Bradley
sooner was a fundamental misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   Several Gore advisers point to that as one of a string of
miscalculations, missed opportunities and simple misfortune that
resulted in a plight that they never anticipated: After entering
the presidential competition with the vast resources of the White
House and Democratic establishment behind him _ and more
institutional advantages than any candidate in modern times _ Gore
now finds himself in a harrowing battle for his party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier on, the differences between the two could have been
painted in bright lights,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, one of
Gore's leading supporters in Congress, ``and it would have been
much harder for Bradley to have gotten any traction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has cast himself as the ``underdog,'' a maneuver that his
aides said was designed to diminish expectations even further.
Nevertheless, many of Gore's aides and advisers said they were
unnerved, if not panicked, by the state of the campaign. They
expressed hope that despite the fast-moving competition for the
nomination, there was still time for Gore, in the words of Roy
Neel, a confidant, ``to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dogfight for the nomination,'' said Neel, Gore's
first chief of staff in the White House. ``All campaigns go through
cycles of upheaval, dislocation and turmoil. It happens to the
best. But I would never have predicted this. I never did. I don't
even think Bill Bradley would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gore has time to recover. He is still viewed by
Democratic leaders as the favorite for the nomination and enjoys
the aggressive support of President Clinton. Although Bradley is
pulling ahead in polls in crucial states like New Hampshire and New
York, Gore is still ahead in other important states like Iowa and
in national surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined to be interviewed for this article. But in more
than a dozen extensive interviews, people in the highest echelons
of his operation _ including current and former aides, outside
advisers as well as workers in the field _ described the internal
deliberations that led to his predicament.
</P>
<P>
   Past and present campaign officials are engaging in a frenzy of
post-mortems and recriminations; some are blaming everyone but
themselves for giving Gore inferior advice. But, in the end, they
conceded, a campaign is a reflection of its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to be a great president, but he might not
be a very good campaign manager,'' said Lorraine Voles, Gore's
former communications director. ``That's not where his skills
really lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of reprimands, most of these people agreed on to speak
only if they were not identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   A senior campaign official, worried that Gore might not easily
recover, said, ``The thing that's most heartbreaking to me is he's
a solid, strong candidate who ought to be president for a million
different reasons.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather than one misguided move, the Gore campaign's current
state results from what Neel described as ``a conspiracy of
factors.'' No one will ever know whether different decisions would
have left the vice president in a better position, or a worse one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the interviews, people in the campaign cited several
things that _ in hindsight _ they would have done differently
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most fundamental, they said, was Gore's inclination
to mount a traditional, incumbent-style race from the White House.
Repeatedly, advisers said, he resisted pleas from some advisers to
break free from his formal role and present himself as a candidate.
Instead, Gore and others felt that if they could clear the field of
his most threatening rivals, notably House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, and act as if he were already the nominee, he could stay
above the political fray and easily capture the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's advisers did not consider that the public might
not be eager for a traditional insider's campaign, particularly
after the impeachment and trial of Clinton. They said they had
conversations about locating the campaign headquarters in
Tennessee, but decided it would be too impractical for a vice
president who lives in Washington. And virtually no one, they said,
viewed Bradley as a political menace.
</P>
<P>
   Another miscalculation involved how the candidate was presented,
aides said. Gore was adroit at putting the mechanics in place, like
lining up endorsements and building campaign infrastructures in
Iowa and New Hampshire. But aides said the campaign did not devote
enough attention to explaining Gore and giving people a reason to
support him. ``His schedule became so efficient that it lost its
heart,'' said one ``We were putting out press releases of people
endorsing the vice president. But we didn't say why. It all became
about process.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some aides said, Gore was prone to micro-managing
his own campaign; it was initially run not by one strong manager
but by a series of people with varying responsibilities. As a
result, the operation was rife with disorganization, which led to
excessive spending. The organizational woes also made it harder for
Gore to raise money. Aides said the heavy spending was caused by
the campaign's determination to stage fancy (but costly)
presidential-style events _ and by an original reluctance from the
vice president to shed overpaid consultants. For example, the
campaign did not think twice about spending $800 for lighting at
outdoor events in the middle of the afternoon _ just so there would
be fewer shadows for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With repeated staff reshufflings, the campaign also has been
plagued by turmoil and internal skirmishes. Gore's closest advisers
_ including Ronald Klain, who was chief of staff, and Robert
Squier, a media adviser _ have been supplanted by relative
newcomers. ``There was a long time when everyone was in charge _
and no one was in charge,'' said one top aide. The campaign's two
most important forces now are Tony Coelho, the former congressman
who took charge in May, and Carter Eskew, a media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   While Eskew is an old friend of Gore's, the vice president and
Coelho do not have a particularly deep history. That is a marked
contrast to the tightly-controlled Bradley and Bush operations,
which are run by people who have been close to the candidates for
years, and have been far more disciplined in putting forth campaign
themes and using resources.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the Gore campaign credit Coelho for at least
taking charge and making decisions. And they credit Eskew for
forcing Gore to lace his speeches with gripping biographical
detail. Yet they complain that upheavals in leadership have left a
campaign that is still in turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is Gore's image. Many advisers still recall _ and
they shudder when they do _ the news conference in March 1997 when
Gore defended his fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign,
declaring repeatedly, that there was ``no controlling legal
authority'' that found he violated the law. They said that
performance, and subsequent incidents, have cemented a public
impression of Gore as a plodding, uninspiring politician.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the image problem, Gore's advisers said, was Gore's
self-deprecating stiff jokes. Several aides said they had told the
vice president for months, if not years, that the jokes had run
their course. But Gore continued to make it a constant theme until
the spring. Gore's advisers also said internal polls showed his
that image was damaged by his well-publicized boast in March that
he is the father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems were not of his making. The Lewinsky scandal, for
instance, froze the Gore campaign throughout 1998. Gore's aides
thought it would appear unseemly to start an overt political
campaign for the White House at a time when it would appear that
the vice president was distancing himself from Clinton's travails.
</P>
<P>
   In something of a vice presidential curse, the second in command
often has a tough time emerging from the president's shadow. In the
runup to his election in 1988, Vice President George Bush was also
confronted with discouraging poll numbers. He even pronounced
himself the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign started with this air of inevitability,'' Neel
said. ``But no one would have predicted Monica Lewinsky two years
ago. No one would have predicted that a single Republican would
rise out of a pack of nobodys and raise more than $50 million in
six or eight months.'' Gore has raised raised roughly $24 million;
Bradley, who took in more than Gore in the last last quarter, $18
million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two years ago, Gore seemed perfectly poised to
win the nomination. Month after month, he painstakingly courted
constituencies such as labor and Jewish leaders, and he toiled
behind-the-scenes to demonstrate that he had so much political
muscle that most of his rivals bowed out of the race, from Gephardt
to Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska to Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers eyed Gephardt as its greatest threat because he
could best compete for all of the institutional advantages that the
Vice President wanted, from fund raising to endorsements from
lawmakers and unions. Gore and his advisers were so preoccupied
with denying Gephardt any advantages _ he devoted much of last year
cozying up to the House leader _ that they took steps like hiring
his speech writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became such an obsession,'' said one adviser. Asked about
Bradley, the adviser said, ``I don't think anyone ever thought it
would be a big deal if he ran.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Gephardt announced in February that he would not run,
Gore and his people felt that the campaign was on track. ``When
people dropped out of the race, that kept us feeding on the idea
that Gore's got a good grip on things,'' said another top adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said the campaign lulled itself into a false sense of
security. ``As vice president, you come into the race and you don't
see any real opposition out there,'' he said. ``All your polls are
good. The economy's great. Unemployment's low. The stars look all
lined up. I would fault the campaign for one thing: they put it
into fourth gear before he started out in first gear.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Bradley made clear that he was running for president,
the Gore campaign took months to retool its strategy. The campaign
was in many ways modeled after Clinton's re-election bid: For as
long as possible, appear presidential and do not make it seem like
you are running for president.
</P>
<P>
   That is why when Gore formed a campaign organization and filed
papers with the Federal Election Commission, the move was announced
on New Year's Eve, so few people would notice. The campaign did not
even plan to launch Gore's showy announcement tour until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They legitimately, though incorrectly, thought they could wait
to put a campaign together well into '99,'' Neel said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Bush's momentum _ as well as Bradley's _ led the
Gore campaign to move up its announcement to June. But many of
Gore's advisers now say the announcement tour was completely
fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the campaign was preoccupied with the announcement
for two months and lavished enormous amounts of money on it. Even
so, the tour was marred by production failures. And Gore's decision
to use the occasion to chastise the president for the Lewinsky
scandal further hindered the vice president from establishing his
own identity. Several advisers said they regret that Gore spewed
out too many policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we needed to do was more forcefully give people a sense
of who Al Gore is and what's in his heart as opposed to what's in
his head,'' said one adviser. ``We began a little too cerebral with
issues. That was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gore's aides say the entire announcement tour was a
waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Announcing in June was a mistake _ it was too soon,'' said one
adviser. ``It was an overcompensation for an earlier mistake. He
had spent four months not being a candidate _ the perception was
the the only way to get out as a candidate was to announce. But we
spent the months of May and June doing nothing but getting ready
for the announcement. And we ended up getting mixed press from it
at a critical time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, a Gore supporter, said the
campaign's most daunting challenge now is to overcome its image as
inept. ``Everyone's telling horror stories _ whether they're true
or not, they catch on,'' he said. ``We have to turn this thing
around.''

SMOG ERUPTION IN HOUSTON AREA PROMPTS PROBE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL DAWSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A suspicious eruption of high smog readings Thursday,
including the Houston area's highest in a decade, has prompted a
state investigation of local industries in a search for the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The day's highest measurement, recorded in nearby Deer Park, was
double the national health standard's maximum permissible level for
ground-level ozone, a respiratory irritant and smog's chief
ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   The health standard is a one-hour average reading of 125 parts
per billion (or ppb). The Deer Park reading of 251 ppb was in the
middle of a range deemed ``very unhealthy'' by federal officials.
It was the highest local ozone measurement since a 271 ppb reading
in 1989, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Deer Park reading, six other state and municipal
monitoring stations also measured ground-level ozone above the
health standard Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's readings above the standard on that day pushed it
ahead of Los Angeles as the U.S. metropolitan area with the most
1999 days with one or more ozone violations. In all previous years,
Los Angeles has recorded the highest number of violation days.
</P>
<P>
   In a possible prelude to next year's presidential race, Vice
President Al Gore criticized Gov. George W. Bush's environmental
record Thursday, citing Houston's ozone problem. A Bush spokesman
replied that Gore is an environmental extremist and said Bush has
worked to reduce pollution in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials said Friday that the sequence and
timing of Thursday's high ozone readings prompt them to suspect a
chemical release, possibly from an industrial facility, as the
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Ground-level ozone forms when certain air pollutants _ released
by vehicles, industries and other sources _ react in sunlight.
Varying weather conditions can promote or hamper ozone formation,
with the highest numbers often appearing miles downwind of emission
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has recorded 44 days this year with at least one ozone
reading above the health standard
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just a typical ozone day in Houston, Texas,''
Andy Saenz, spokesman for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission, said of the Thursday readings.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the episode has triggered ``a whole different level
of response'' by state officials, Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find a smoking gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their investigation, TNRCC officials will be checking
industries along the Houston Ship Channel, in the Bayport
industrial complex at LaPorte and in Galveston County to determine
if they were responsible for any major accidental pollution
releases that went unreported, Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
   Most major local industries are outside the city of Houston and
therefore beyond the investigatory jurisdiction of the city's
environmental officials.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for the Houston Health and Human
Services Department, said city officials will press the TNRCC to
conduct a vigorous investigation of the Thursday event.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Houston department's Bureau of Air Quality
Control thought the pattern of high ozone readings Thursday
possibly pointed to pollution from the Bayport complex as a cause,
Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   That complex of plants is located southeast of the state's Deer
Park ozone-monitoring station. Prevailing winds often blow from
that area toward Deer Park.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's high readings started showing up much earlier than
usual, helping prompt officials' suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, high ozone readings don't occur until the afternoon,
after pollutants have had time to react in the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   But Saenz said the first reading above the health standard was
recorded at the Deer Park site at 10 a.m. CST. The excessive
readings continued there for six hours.
</P>
<P>
   The 251 ppb reading easily exceeded the area's previous highest
ozone reading in 1999, which was 211 ppb on Aug. 6 at an
industry-sponsored monitoring station in Texas City.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone levels measured at all city and state monitors on Friday
were below the health standard, according to preliminary readings.
</P>
<P>
   The TNRCC must submit a new ozone-reduction plan to federal
officials for approval later this year that lists new
pollution-control strategies that will bring Houston's ozone levels
below the health standard by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   Although Houston's ozone problem has improved considerably since
the 1970s, government analysts disagree about whether it has
continued to improve more slowly since the early 1990s or is
staying about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Local government and business leaders, including Mayor Lee
Brown, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels and Ned Holmes, chairman
of the Greater Houston Partnership and chairman of the Port of
Houston Authority, have formed a coalition to help plot new
ozone-reducing strategies.

 &HT;    Braves outlast Astros 5-3 in extra-inning thriller
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For all the October drama the Braves have staged this
decade _ from Sid Bream and David Justice, to Tom Glavine and
Lonnie Smith _ they have discovered new ways to muster up more.
</P>
<P>
   It may have only been the Division Series, but the Braves proved
the shortest and the most intense of the playoff series can mean
the most. With their 5-3 win over the Astros in a 12-inning,
four-hour-19-minute gut-wrenching marathon in what may prove to be
the second-to-last game ever in the Astrodome, the Braves redefined
themselves this postseason from nearly-out to a team on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go on and do something special,'' said John Smoltz, who
will pitch today against Shane Reynolds in Game 4, ``this game will
be remembered for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   A win like that had the Braves daring to look into their
postseason future and their postseason past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than `92, the seventh game of the NLCS against
Pittsburgh, all the great games we lost,'' Tom Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   But this one would be different, and the Braves knew it after
the 10th inning when John Rocker gave them a miracle, getting out
of a bases loaded no-out jam. He got an assist on the play of the
year by Walt Weiss on a grounder by Tony Eusebio that he fielded
and fired home for the second out. Brian Jordan took care of the
offense, giving new meaning to the term cleanup hitter by driving
in all five runs on a three-run homer and the game-winning double
in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of plays make you wonder,'' Chipper Jones said,
referring to Weiss. ``That maybe it was meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros and Braves played this game like their lives depended
on it. And in baseball terms, it did. They put on enough excitement
for an entire series for the pleasure and pain of 48,625
towel-waving Texans, just looking for a team to bust out.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was much obliged.
</P>
<P>
   He'd already taken Astros ace and NL Cy Young candidate Mike
Hampton deep on a three-run home run, only his second home run
since Aug. 15, to give the game its first dramatic turn in the form
of a 3-2 Braves lead in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I can start looking for pitches now,'' said Chipper
Jones, who was pitched around to bring Jordan up in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With Larry Dierker holding onto closer Billy Wagner for
something that never came, Jordan drove a 1-2 Jay Powell pitch past
Jeff Bagwell and into the right field corner to score both Nixon
and Bret Boone, who had collected back-to-back one-out hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were facing the best,'' Jordan said. ``I just wanted
to go out and be aggressive and hope for the best. The best was
good enough tonight.''

   NEW YORK _ There were dramas and sub-dramas at Shea Stadium on
Friday night for Game 3 between the Mets and the Diamondbacks.
Before the game, Manager Bobby Valentine revealed that Orel
Hershiser was relegated to the Mets' bullpen. Valentine also
addressed disparaging comments about members of his team and staff
that had been attributed to him in a national magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The most disturbing news for Mets fans was that the slugger Mike
Piazza was out of the game with a bruised thumb and that Todd Pratt
would replace him.
</P>
<P>
   But for one family, the central drama was Shawon Dunston.
Dunston was playing center field for the Mets as the team played
its first playoff game at Shea in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston played a key role in the Mets' victories over Pittsburgh
at the end of the regular season and in Game 1 of this playoff
series against Arizona. He ran down shot after deep shot to help
keep the Mets close until Edgardo Alfonzo won the game with his
ninth-inning grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a playoff game, but I'm going to look at it as
another game where I've got to go play hard and do the best I
can,'' Dunston said. ``I know it's a playoff game, but I let other
people think about that. I know what it is, but I don't focus on it
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Mets played in the playoffs Dunston was
playing his fourth season in the majors with the Chicago Cubs and
was selected to the All-Star team. Life was good.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 Dunston, a 19-year-old infielder from Thomas Jefferson
High School in Brooklyn, became the first player from the New York
area to be the No. 1 selection in baseball's summer free-agent
draft. He was selected by the Cubs. One scout said Dunston was
``the best-looking player I've seen in 30 years of scouting.''
Another called him ``the best overall player I've seen around in 20
or 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He was regarded as such a force: a third baseman with speed and
power. The Mets chose Dwight Gooden two picks later. When Dunston
was assigned to a minor league team in 1982, he predicted he would
make it to the majors in four seasons. He made it in three. ``I
just wanted to play baseball,'' he said. ``My goal was to make
$500,000. I didn't want to be a bonus baby. I just wanted to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 19, Dunston was projected as one of the best players New
York had turned out in 30 years. At age 36 he is a well-respected
player, a player the Mets desperately need to perform, especially
now that Piazza is injured. For 17 years Dunston has lived a dream.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 he played in the National League playoffs with Chicago.
Then came the injuries: a herniated disk in 1992; in 1993 back
rehabilitation reduced his time. He returned for 88 games in 1994
and played his 1,000th major league game that season.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995 he was back full time, but he was traded to San
Francisco after the season. He was stunned, but it was just the
beginning. He was traded back to Chicago in 1997, then was traded
to Pittsburgh near the end of the season, was traded to Cleveland
for the start of the 1998 season and to San Francisco midway
through that season.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston strained his left groin in 1996, had a concussion, two
fractures of the left eye orbit and fractured his cheekbone. He
rebounded in 1997 with the Cubs and had one of his best seasons in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're on one team, you're loyal, you play hard, you do what
you gotta do,'' he said. ``They tell you you can still play, then
they trade you. Then you go back to the same team. Then another
team trades you. You get picked up. They say: `We love you. We
aren't going to trade you.' Then they trade you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're old and you can be replaced. You can be moved out. But
six teams, that kind of bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 1998 he was traded to St. Louis, and the Cardinals
traded Dunston to the Mets for Craig Paquette, a minor league
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I don't like is that I was with one team for 11
straight years and then the last three years I've been on six
teams,'' Dunston said. ``If someone would have told me that I'd
have played with six teams in two years, I would have said no. If
they would have done this to me earlier in my career, they really
would have heartbroken me.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Dunston's salvation has been his
versatility. In high school he was a third baseman. Shortly after
being drafted he was moved to short, where he played for 11
seasons. He has played second base, left field, right and now, for
the Mets in what may be the most critical stint of all, he is
patrolling center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time and place for everything,'' he said. ``This
could be the time and the place.''

LIGHTER TAYLOR MAKES IMPRESSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For his previous training-camp audition, Maurice
Taylor must have thought a waist was a terrible thing to mind.
</P>
<P>
   When the 6-foot-8 Los Angeles Clippers power forward rolled into
College of the Dessert, um, Desert, after the lockout ended, he
dented the scales at 289 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   This season, ``Mini Mo'' _ he registered at a greyhound weight
of 257 _ says only the mind matters.
</P>
<P>
   Example:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the 22-year-old laughed after realizing he'd nailed it _ in
reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, now in his third season since checking out of Michigan a
year early, was referring to his desire to remain a Clipper for 72
additional months and $70.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the contract extension offer didn't happen, encouraging
critics of owner Donald T. Sterling to believe there was little big
thinking involved.
</P>
<P>
   However, his subsequent quest for a trade _ piggybacked with a
solemn promise to leave after his contract expires next June _ has
not prevented Taylor from bringing a big-money game to training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   During night-session scrimmages at L.A. Southwest College,
Taylor, rookie Lamar Odom and newly acquired shooting guard Derek
Anderson have led the conspiracy to embrace coach Chris Ford's
faster-break philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kinda scary, isn't it?'' Taylor said after a typically rousing
demonstration of thrill-ride basketball. ``I love that kind of
tempo.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we'll roll out the C-word _ chemistry. There's something new
in the petri dish, because the Clippers seems to have it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all mostly young guys,'' Taylor said. ``None of us have
gotten caught up in the so-called `Clipper Syndrome.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast breaks: Center Michael Olowokandi has developed a hip
pointer that has kept him on the stationary bike for the last four
workouts. . . . Free-agent point guard Charles Jones, who led the
nation in scoring his last two seasons at Long Island U., has been
impressive through the first three days of camp. . . . Odom has had
several show-stopping moments during the evening scrimmages. As
expected, Odom, a 6-9 small forward, has excelled at snagging a
defensive rebound and leading a stylish-yet-efficient fast break.

   NEW YORK _ Lawrence A. Bossidy spoke of the value of hiring
those who have failed. L. Dennis Kozlowski shook his head at the
``absurd'' valuations of Internet companies, while Charles B. Wang
talked about having dot-com envy. Shelly Lazarus defended the
$80-million-plus pay package that Hewlett-Packard recently awarded
its new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Early one Monday morning in late September, these four chief
executives _ Bossidy of Allied Signal, Kozlowski of Tyco
International, Wang of Computer Associates International and Ms.
Lazarus of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide _ gathered over coffee at The
New York Times to talk about leadership and how they do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All are featured in a recent book, ``Lessons from the Top: The
Search for America's Best Business Leaders,'' (Doubleday/Currency,
1999) written by Thomas J. Neff and James M. Citrin, two executive
recruiting consultants from Spencer Stuart in New York. Neff and
Citrin also joined the discussion, as did Reed Abelson, Alison
Leigh Cowan and Patrick J. Lyons of The Times.
</P>
<P>
   The four chief executives brought different perspectives to the
two-hour discussion. Bossidy, who has more than four decades of
business experience, helped turn around Allied Signal and is
currently merging it with Honeywell to create a company with $25
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlowski has guided Tyco through the purchase of more than 100
companies since he took over as chief executive in 1992. At
Computer Associates, one of the world's largest independent
software concerns, Wang managed the transition from founder to the
leader of a company with more than $5 billion in annual sales. And
while the agency that Ms. Lazarus runs is not an independent or
public company _ the London-based WPP Group acquired it in 1989 _
it has long been one of the most successful advertising agencies in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discussion focused on the challenge of managing
people: the fierce competition for talented employees, the need to
communicate effectively, the growing demand for a healthier balance
between work and life outside the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The four also frankly discussed compensation, and all noted the
importance of their own actions in conveying the values of the
companies they lead.
</P>
<P>
   Following are excerpts of the conversation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Reed Abelson &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Making Their Mark  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What kind of thoughts do you have about the legacy you're
going to leave behind? Is it just to have the biggest company? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY It isn't size that is as important to me as to have the
employee base be convinced that we were always willing to change a
lot of things, that the company had some edge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI We went out and did a reverse acquisition of ADT a
couple of years ago where we had to charge our shareholders capital
gains on the deal. It was a pretty unpopular decision with
shareholders and even with my board. I hope to exemplify leadership
in a way that we're willing to do things that are unpopular. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I don't know if legacy is defined only in business. If I
could be remembered for something, it's probably how I raised my
kids and what (else) I did. As much as we think we're very
important, I think we forget there's probably somebody in our ranks
who thinks they can do it better and probably can do it better. Our
job probably is to make sure that they have the right values. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I inherited a legacy, which came home very much to me
when David Ogilvy died. We had a memorial service, and thousands of
employees returned who hadn't worked for the company in 20 and 30
years because the emotional connection to what David founded was so
remarkable. So I see my job much more is to keep that alive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG Why wouldn't you make your own legacy? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS Well, because it's marvelous, because it's founded on a
set of values. It's not founded on a personality, on an individual.
And it's a set of values that are all about excellent people and
excellent work and all about recognizing individual contribution.
I've stayed for 28 years because I believe in all those things. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Success and Succession
</P>
<P>
   Q: The book ``Lessons from the Top'' is clearly a reflection in
time. As we approach 2000, what qualities and skills will your
successors need? &QL; 
BOSSIDY Trying to stay ahead of the game, trying to work with a
work force which is far more independent than it was when I started
and trying to be responsive and keep those organizations at the
leading edge will be the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, you could be a CEO 10 years ago and never have talked to
your employees. You talk to them every day now.
</P>
<P>
   This notion of CEO and COO (chief operating officer), which I
think is awful, will go in the next 10 years. It's a bad thing
under a set of circumstances that doesn't envision transition
immediately, because it separates two jobs that should be joined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I agree that the COO concept is a dangerous one in
most companies, because it really separates the CEO from the
operating groups. &QL;

MORE BATTLES OVER DATA ACCESS SEEN AT FOI CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In Galveston, it was student test scores. In
Houston, it was government plans affecting the environment. In
Austin, it was closely guarded information about university
investments.
</P>
<P>
   All were official documents that eventually were made public,
but only after protracted and sometimes costly disputes with the
keepers of those records. That was the assessment of panelists
Friday at the annual conference of the Freedom of Information
Foundation of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of battles over open records and open meetings said
they are accustomed to delaying tactics and intransigence by
secretive officials. However, they warned of new challenges posed
by privatizing government services.
</P>
<P>
   While public officials defended legal provisions that keep some
records sealed and meeting doors locked, open government advocates
said they will try again in the 2001 legislative session to improve
citizen access to information, including that from public-private
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's legislative session, the media were again
thwarted in efforts to clarify what records from private companies
may be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was simple _ to follow the public dollar across the
aisle into the public sector,'' said M.J. Nicchio of the Texas
Daily Newspaper Association. The media's legislation was weakened
to include only major state contracts with private companies _
those worth more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   New legislation will be submitted in 2001, some of it sought by
state agencies that want to clarify how open government rules apply
to private contractors, Nicchio said.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of the push for disclosure is that public
meetings have become ``very scripted, very choreographed, often
devoid of any controversial issues,'' said Tom Ricks, president of
the University of Texas Investment Management Co., the entity that
manages the university's multibillion-dollar investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's human nature, and I think it will also apply to our
meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The investment company, which contends that its deliberations
sometimes warrant protection for competitive or proprietary
reasons, recently opened its meetings in response to public
pressure generated by the Houston Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our directors will be much more cautious'' about
discussing managers, audits and other delicate matters because of
the risk of having it misconstrued or sensationalized in the
media,'' Ricks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my view is that (it) is to the detriment of oversight,
because it will drive certain issues _ particularly involving
critical self-evaluation _ underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle reporter R.G. Ratcliffe, whose reporting led
to policy changes at the investment company, said the public
deserves as much information as possible from entities like UTIMCO,
which handle taxpayer money and might be influenced by political
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The controversy that we had here is minor compared to some
that have occurred elsewhere,'' Ratcliffe said.
</P>
<P>
   While some participants were concerned about cutting-edge open
government issues, others said they faced challenges over just
applying established open-records law.
</P>
<P>
   Houston environmental lawyer Jim Blackburn said he struggled to
get information from the Port of Houston about its master plan and
about political advertising for a proposed container facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're running across in some of these governmental
agencies is pure obstructionist tactics. You simply have to
persevere.''

 NEW YORK: operating groups.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WANG You know, maybe by the traditional definition of what the
CEO or COO does, what their job function is, perhaps you can say
that. But maybe I'm fortunate. I know who the next CEO is: He's my
COO. But he doesn't really operate in that traditional sense. We do
things together. He happens to have the unfortunate task of doing
everything I don't like to do.
</P>
<P>
   If you asked him, he'd probably tell you he can run the company
better than I can. And I hope he feels that way, because that's
what makes somebody who should be the CEO.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS The thing that keeps me up at night is the scarcity of
talent. In my industry, we keep recycling the same eight people.
There's so much opportunity for young people now _ the world of the
Internet and start-ups and dot-coms, and 28-year-olds making $50
million overnight. The challenge for us is to figure out how to
keep those people long enough that they are ready to become CEOs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think there's more talent than ever before. The
trouble is, it migrates to narrower places. A few years ago, if you
didn't go to a consulting firm, you weren't essentially in the
main. Now if you're not with a dot-com you're basically not allowed
to the party. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI There are 20-year-olds coming out of college now, and
out of graduate school, that are far brighter and have a far
greater perspective of the world than anybody did in my class. But
there's another thing that's happening, too: Really talented,
bright people are starting to question the life styles that are
involved in this kind of work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS Absolutely. I think we're going to have to get much more
flexible and open-minded about how we _ I don't even say employ
people _ but how we source resources. Because there are people who
are now saying, ``I'll give you X number of hours a week but I am
not signing up as a full-time employee.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you give us an example of the flexible arrangements you
find yourself making? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS Well, we have a man who wants to live in Penelope,
Texas, where he has a ranch. I'd make him a creative leader in my
agency; he doesn't want to do that. He said: ``I will sell you 40
percent of my time. And I will also retain the right to refuse an
assignment if I don't want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has done a brilliant job for us, absolutely brilliant. If I
can get five more of him, if I get a hundred more of him, I would
take them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY You've also got to be careful that the only people you
retain aren't those who are risk-averse and don't want to do the
dot-com situation. So I say to our people: ``Let's go get some
people from the dot-coms right now. They're failing every day. But
at least they showed the interest and the courage to take some
risks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: So failure can be a good thing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I used to hire real estate people. I always hired ones
that had failures. I wanted the person who had lost a lot of money
for somebody else to come work for me. You don't reward _ you don't
praise _ failure. But it can be a wonderful thing in terms of what
you learn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Even if the failure is very public?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think every failure needs to be analyzed. Why? What
happened? And sometimes you've got to stand up, yourself, and say,
``I was a part of that and I have as much responsibility for it as
anybody does. Now, let's make sure we don't make that same mistake
again when we develop another product.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I think what you've got to do is take the blame. I mean,
ultimately you give all the credit to your people and you take all
the blame.
</P>
<P>
   We tell our people we're no smarter than any other company in
the world. The problem with all the other companies seems to be,
they may spend five times the amount of time to make decisions,
spinning about what went wrong: ``It's really not my fault.'' And
all of that time could have been used to make decisions. So if we
could just cut out all the spinning, then we'd have that much more
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI Any time you're going to try something, at whatever
level, there's always a risk of failure. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY And if you study it for three months, or study it for a
day, probably the percentages are about the same. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Embracing the Internet
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: These days, one primary reason that chief executives seem to
fail and are shown the door is the Internet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I don't see the Internet as being the demise of CEOs.
There are a couple of examples, maybe, but CEOs usually trip over
themselves. They make slow decisions or bad decisions or invest the
money in the wrong way or don't have a focus _ aren't quick out of
the box. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I think the healthiest thing that's coming out of this
whole Internet phenomenon is that the good CEOs are rethinking the
whole way they go to the market.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not the Internet per se. I think that becomes sort of
like a distraction. But because you have this new capability _ this
new way to distribute, inform, communicate _ the good companies are
stepping back and saying, ``What does this mean about the whole way
we go to market?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY One of the things I try to do is get everybody in the
company involved on the Net in some way _ manufacturing people,
more outsourcing; purchasing people, more global sourcing. And you
can use it as a way to reinvent the company. You get a whole new
set of excitement; some new people come to the fore. You do some
things experimentally that you would never do otherwise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   E-Communicating Pros and Cons
</P>
<P>
   Q: You all lead large organizations. How do you stay in touch
with your employees? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG Get a good COO! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY There's such a thing as the e-mail now. And you have an
easier time communicating with anybody than ever. You can issue
e-mails, you can get e-mails, all the time. And I think it's
essential that you do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS But I also think there's no substitute for
face-to-face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I agree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS Something happens when you are in the room with people
with whom you work, trying to solve a problem together or just
listening to them. And the e-mail becomes more meaningful after the
trip with the face-to-face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI We have 140,000 employees in 80 countries. And it
takes a lot of face-to-face time, a lot of travel on my part, to be
able to articulate our goals and where we're going.
</P>
<P>
   But I really like showing up. You know, I really like being
there and being able to have a dialogue like this. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY If you aren't willing to communicate and if you're not
good at it, you're at a disadvantage. You have to do even more than
you've ever done before in whatever way you do it, but it's
something that you ought to do every day, someplace. &QL;

 NEW YORK: day, someplace.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI Employees are far more willing to critique _ openly
critique _ the CEO than ever before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY That's better than having it only in chat rooms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I agree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I don't have e-mail. I force my people to get in touch with
me. And it takes an effort. And it must be important, then, too.
</P>
<P>
   And I travel a lot. Once a year we also bring all our field
people together for what we call a kickoff. We spend a week of
basically bringing them all up to date on what's happened. But as
you get bigger, you still have to force the issue of thinking
small, because otherwise you end up in a bureaucracy that can choke
you. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fair Play in the Numbers Game &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about that other constituency: the institutional
investors, the analysts? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG My COO deals with Wall Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I spend 10 percent of my time communicating with
investors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY One of the things I think CEOs do is understand who your
constituents are, and one of them is share owners. You've got
customers, you've got employees, you've got suppliers, you've got
share owners, you've got communities in which you live. You've got
to spend time with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does paying attention to the share owners make you too
short-term at times? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI You absolutely have got to deliver what you promised
in the short term. And you've got to have a strategy in place
worrying about two years from now. I pretty much know what the next
year and a half will look like and have a forecast in place that
I'm very confident in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I'm actually sitting here thinking this is probably the
only benefit of having been acquired hostilely by an English
company.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have seen very good managements run into trouble when they
surprise analysts. But then, maybe truly good managements never
surprise analysts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY You're better off to run it on the basis that you avoid
those surprises to the fullest possible extent.
</P>
<P>
   NEFF You could probably get away with one surprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I don't agree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY No. The price is immediate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI Yeah. You miss earnings by a penny and you can lose $3
billion of market value the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Doesn't that increase the temptation to have a little bit in
the back pocket to make sure you're going to make your numbers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI It increases the temptation of making sure you give
appropriate guidance (to Wall Street) as to where you think you're
coming out.
</P>
<P>
   You can't manage earnings. There are very specific accounting
rules and SEC rules now that preclude one from going that route.
But it really is terribly important to have good communication and
good visibility of your own businesses, so that you can become, and
are, and continue to be a predictable company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I don't know if you really can be that predictable. There
are a lot of things beyond your control. We do so many deals a
year. Some of them can slip by a few days. You don't know until
almost the _ actually, till the last day of the quarter, many
times. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: You see a company that makes its numbers for 15 years in a
row. Do you suspect they're just lucky enough to be in a very
predictable business, or do you suspect that the chief executive is
good at making the numbers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I think they're good. I think companies like GE are
good. They're well-run companies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That Urge to Merge &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: This is a golden age for mergers. Do you see that changing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think it depends on two things: What's the interest
rate environment and what's the stock market going to be?
</P>
<P>
   I think there's benefit to being big. To Charles' point, I think
you want to be as big as you can and run it as small as you can, as
a way to be quick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI When interest rates fluctuate, pricing usually comes
down on companies to be acquired and you're more inclined to use
some combination of stock and cash in those deals. I would expect,
for any horizon I can see, a Tyco that would continue to be quite
active. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY Dennis, let me ask you a question. What's going to
happen to your view if pooling (of interests, a method of
accounting for mergers) is eliminated? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I think what we attempted to do with Raychem _ where
we could have pooled Raychem and shown another penny or two a share
but where we used half stock and half equity _ is the kind of deal
that you're going to see going forward. However, part of the
proposal is showing earnings before the amortization of goodwill.
Then you have the best of all worlds. And there are so many
unintended consequences of poolings, limitations that the SEC puts
on you _ not being able to sell off things that you don't want to
have, on the purchase of your own stock _ I think it's almost a
good thing that poolings will be eliminated. It will protect us
from ourselves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I agree. I think there's going to be a lot of furor
expressed on the potential elimination, but I don't think at the
end of the day it's going to have much impact.
</P>
<P>
   A Brave New World? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does this unprecedented period of prosperity herald a ``new
economy,'' or are you afraid that it's got to end pretty soon? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I think we are in a new economy. I think we've gone through
this kind of industrial age, the marketing age, and now we're
really in an information age. And I think the people we call the
knowledge workers are expected to have more information and make
decisions faster. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI It's a true global economy now, too, that just didn't
exist five years ago, where you're buying and selling on a
worldwide basis, and your competitor now may be in Indiana, or your
competitor may be in Brazil, or your competitor may be in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the information technology that you have available to you
now allows you to see a lot of things on a real-time basis that you
weren't able to see five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the business cycle gone? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI No, probably not. In business, as far as I know it,
the good times get bad and bad times get good. Maybe there are
longer cycles now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think, too, there's another factor, which doesn't mean
that markets won't, over time, change.
</P>
<P>
   I think the U.S. has a big competitive edge now. We have taken a
lead in the information technology. We've taken the lead in
Internet. I don't say that we're destined to always have that
advantage, but I do think in the last number of years we've moved
faster than the Europeans, we've moved faster than the people in
the Far East. &QL;

FUNDING FOR MENTALLY ILL, RETARDED RESOLVED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A $30 million budget shortfall that threatened
to slash services to the mentally ill and retarded in Texas has
been resolved through next August, the agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say that we are deeply pleased and gratified that we
have the funding necessary to ensure that clients continue to
receive services,'' said Laurie Lentz, spokeswoman for the Texas
Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said $6.4 million will be transferred to the agency
from a social services fund overseen by the Texas Health and Human
Services Commission. Along with other steps, such as prepaying
leases and cuts in administrative spending, full funding has now
been restored through the end of August 2000.
</P>
<P>
   News that the budget shortfall had been resolved for the current
fiscal year came as the state auditor's office released a report
confirming the earlier announced shortfall. The audit said the
mistake occurred largely from clerical errors, including a $16.2
million data entry error.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, said Friday the immediate
crisis, which threatened to cut services and highly touted
``new-generation'' anti-psychotic drugs, appears over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can take care of the first fiscal year probably without any
pain,'' he said. ``We still have to deal with the second fiscal
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers familiar with the problem had assumed that an
additional $30 million budget shortfall would occur in the second
year of the two-year funding cycle.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lentz said that's unlikely. She said steps taken this
year to achieve more efficiencies and better collections from
private insurers will go a long way toward resolving the agency's
budget woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really kind of feel like this puts us on pretty solid
ground for next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   MHMR Commissioner Karen Hale said the agency intends to
implement recommendations from the state auditor to ``prevent
future problems.'' She also thanked other state social services
agencies for helping with the mental health agency's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate we can use similar measures to address FY
(fiscal year) 2001 in a way that will not affect client services,''
she said.

 NEW YORK: Far East.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: So higher price-to-earnings ratios are justified? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think on a global basis, yes. You know, markets are
smart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the Internet valuations? Do you all wish you had
dot-com at the end of your company's name? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI No. Some of it is absolutely absurd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I wish we had dot.com.
</P>
<P>
   We do so much business on the Internet, but traditionally, the
perception has been that we are a plumbing company, what's behind
it. Our software manages the largest Web sites in the world, and we
have more security software than any other independent software
company. And yet our valuation is not a dot-com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS Once you relax the profit requirement, you know, it's
very different. And we have clients coming in who are new dot-com
companies who say, ``We have an advertising budget of $70 million,
$80 million,'' and you sort of press them on the economics.
</P>
<P>
   I just saw where Etoys today is going to invest 70 percent of
their sales last year in advertising in the next three months. I
mean, it's madness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY But you know, therefore, that's going to stop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS It's got to stop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY But I do think that the medium will continue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom, what percentage of your placements have been Internet
placements in the last 12 months? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEFF In terms of current assignments in the U.S., it's into the
double digits. It's probably approaching 15 percent, currently. So
we've had over 100 active search assignments for Internet CEOs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Many a brilliant marketing campaign aims to familiarize the
public with these new Internet names. What about the companies that
possess the old great names? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS Well, I think they have an advantage if they use it.
Sears, which is one of our clients, as a name for the old catalog
company, as a place that you trust to get merchandise, is
brilliant. But they've got to get onto it or Amazon.com is going to
become the retailer of the year 2000. I mean, because I don't think
they're stopping at books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I really believe that an established business should look
at a hybrid type model instead of thinking of this as a separate,
distinct silo. Imagine if you could get on line, buy books and at
the end of your whole order, you have a choice: send it to me or go
drive through a drive-through window at Barnes &AMP; Noble and pick up
my package. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY And yet, it's ironic that because of Amazon.com, Barnes
&AMP; Noble's got a better household recognition than ever before. So
the question is: Can you capitalize on that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chief as Superstar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last week George Shaheen surprised all of us by jumping from
Andersen Consulting, which he ran with an iron fist, to the Webvan
Group, the Internet grocery vendor. Out of his mind? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI He has the opportunity to make a whole lot of money
over there, from what I've read. So, you know, it's like the risk
somebody pointed out before: if he has a shot at $100 million or
thereabouts, it's probably a reasonable place to go. And he's
probably a pretty capable executive, so it's a risk worth taking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the media exaggerate the extent to which the CEO is the
company and the company is the CEO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I've thought about that a lot, and I think the
difficulty you have is it's hard to talk about a company _ that
Allied Signal did this or Tyco did that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think you ascribe brilliance too soon. I mean, you
take a Jack Welch (of General Electric) for 20 years _ he deserves
it. He's come through good and bad times and always has done well.
But I don't think you should do it in terms of a year or two. I
mean, you might want to see them season a little. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about CEO compensation? There is some concern that while
the market's been doing wonderfully, CEOs have made out more than
handsomely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY The press had something to do with that. They didn't
like salaries and bonuses, so they said, ``You ought to put more of
your income at risk.'' And so the corporations did, and now they're
complaining about that.
</P>
<P>
   But when I get asked in my own audiences, I say: ``I make a lot
of money. And take on a lot of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   And then I say, ``Our savings plan is up $2.5 billion since I
came.'' That doesn't mean just me _ the whole company has made a
lot. And the people who own the stock in the company make a lot of
money. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I do not receive one single penny of bonus unless my
earnings per share grow over 20 percent a year. However, I do start
accruing restricted shares of stock, and I make an awful lot of
money in the stock. We pay taxes on that, and our compensation is
totally in line with the shareholders. And one could look at it and
say, yeah, we truly are overpaid, but a lot of it's been the
appreciation of the stock market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG It's been noted that I got a $600-and-some million grant.
But people don't realize this was a plan that was approved by 86 or
87 percent of the shareholders. If we brought a value of $18
billion to shareholders, I would think then we'd earned a bonus. It
was a five-year plan with a seven-year tail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI You got a $600 million grant? I'm glad I'm not your
shareholder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I wouldn't mind being your adopted kid. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I had a fascinating conversation last week with someone
who was absolutely outraged by Carly Fiorina's pay package (when
she recently signed on at Hewlett-Packard). And I said, ``Yes, but
why would she have come otherwise?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's often said that at a certain level it no longer matters
how much any of you make, that you would be doing just as good a
job for $100 million less or $20 million less. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI Yeah, all my meals are paid for, for as long as I'm
around. So, I'm not working for that any longer.
</P>
<P>
   But it does make a difference in the charities I ultimately
leave monies behind to, and it's a way of keeping score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY Hewlett-Packard doesn't have a habit of going out and
paying exorbitant salaries, so they wanted her (Ms. Fiorina) to run
the company, and that's what the market was, and she got the market
price. How can you be critical of that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I don't even know her, but I think she would have
considered herself foolish if she left all that money on the table.
Why would she do that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting an Example &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do employees and other stakeholders in the companies look to
activities outside the executive suite as signals about the chief
executive's leadership and values? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG I think charity is a personal thing. We also recognize the
company is also a member of the community and the world at large.
What I try to do is encourage my people to give. If you're an
employee of CA, if you give $1, CA will match $2 for it. So this
way we really push them to give more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I think, though, there is an issue as to how much time a
CEO should spend doing other things.
</P>
<P>
   I think you're hired to run the company. That doesn't mean you
should be ignorant of what's going on in Washington, but you ought
to go down there selectively as opposed to weekly.  &QL;

 NEW YORK: to weekly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't think you can get involved in a whole bunch of
charities. I think you can get involved in a charity and then spend
some time, and influence it, and try to make it better. But the
more I see CEOs fragment their time doing a lot of other things, I
think, the less successful they're going to be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS I'd like to answer your question in a somewhat different
way, because I think I'm always asked these questions about balance
and how do you retain women.
</P>
<P>
   How I spend my time and how I communicate my own values and my
own priorities does have a very significant impact on the employees
in my company. So that when I stay out for three months for
maternity leave, I am well aware that that makes it all right to
take maternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   And if the CEO isn't going to the school play, and the CEO is
canceling his vacation, and the CEO is not coming home to be at his
6-year-old's birthday party, well then, the rest of the company
knows how they're supposed to behave. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: We still haven't seen too many cases of women with small
children running large organizations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG Why is it different for women? I raised my three kids. One
of them is 28 years old. And I raised them while I was building
Computer Associates. Now I have two more kids. One's 6 and one's 1
year old. I go to the school play. I'm the one that goes to the
parent-teacher conference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is a widely cited statistic that two-thirds of the men
who work, are married and have children, have wives who stay at
home, but hardly any working wives with children have stay-at-home
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   WANG My wife works. She works for CA. She has 4,000 people
reporting to her. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI So she is your successor?
</P>
<P>
   WANG No, she's not. She's too nerdy! &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I've had nine children. There's no reason why you can't
be president and do a lot of the things as the kids grow up. I did.
</P>
<P>
   And I do think the hardest deal in the world is for a woman to
have two or three young kids, to work when their spouse works. That
is just physically exhausting. That takes a toll after a while. And
I don't know what we in business have done yet to be able to
resolve that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI We've tackled it a little differently in the last
couple of years, where we've put about 8,000 of our managers
through diversity training, approaching all types of issues, from
creating a culture where a man or a woman can work from the home,
to being much more flexible in their abilities to make
contributions to a company, to being supportive of maternity leaves
before Congress mandated them. And I think you really need to do
that, because if not, you're going to eliminate an awful lot of
talented people out of your pool of resources. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS The smart CEO has to do that. Why would you give up 50
percent of the population when talent's a scarce resource? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIDY I tell people: ``Don't come in here on Saturday and
Sunday unless something special is going on, because all you're
going to do is become a bore. I mean, do something, music or
whatever you like, but for heaven's sake, grow.'' They'll say,
``How many Sundays do you work?'' I work a couple of Sundays a
year, only because something special is happening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the one thing about being a chief executive that you
would change with a wave of your hand, if you could? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KOZLOWSKI I'd probably eliminate the jet plane, so that we
wouldn't be expected to be in so many different places so often.
Jets have really destroyed civilization. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WANG One thing is, don't perceive us CEOs as some kind of higher
order of human beings. I really want to work with people and not
have a meeting where everybody is, ``He's here, so I've got to be
on a different kind of behavior.'' I wish they would just relax.

CLINTON OPENS EMBASSY IN CANADA AS RELATIONS BETWEEN NEIGHBORS
REMAIN WARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 7th graf with Clinton apology) (rk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ Friday, for the first time, an American president
traveled to a foreign nation and inaugurated an American Embassy.
It was fitting that President Clinton broke historical protocol in
Canada, a quiet partner that trades more with the United States
than any other country.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxed outdoor ceremony, with Parliament's landmark
Victorian bell tower mirrored in the glass-and-steel face of the
new embassy, seemed to reflect the easy relations between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 years since a trade agreement was signed, trade
between the United States and Canada has doubled, now running over
$1 billion a day. In the 1990s, Canada has firmly established
itself as the largest source of imported energy for the United
States and the most popular foreign destination for American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In a joking mood on a sunny morning, Clinton cracked that Jean
Chretien, Canada's 65-year-old prime minister, was the only Western
leader ``who could still slalom on water skis with one of his
grandchildren on his shoulders.'' Noting that this was his fifth
visit to Canada as president, Clinton continued ribbing his
Canadian counterpart, saying: ``He also says if I come one more
time I have to start paying taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The laughter faded at the end of his speech, when Clinton
appeared to stray beyond his prepared text, talking about ethnic
strife ``in the land of my forebears in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they make an agreement to do it, they're like a
couple of drunks walking out of the bar for the last time,'' he
said of the on-again, off-again peace process between Protestants
and Catholics in Northern Ireland. ``When they get to the swinging
door, they turn around and go back in, and say, I just can't quite
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   He later said the metaphor was inappropriate, and expressed
``regret for any offense my remarks caused.''
</P>
<P>
   The sparks around the president's joke provided news for
reporters hard pressed to find controversy in a relationship that
Americans take for granted: the world's largest trading
relationship crossing the world's longest undefended border. In
what may also be the world's smoothest relationship, this
cross-border commerce is expected to hit $410 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than one percent of our trade is subject to trade
action,'' said Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the United
States, a career diplomat who is also a nephew of the prime
minister. ``This huge trade goes so smoothly that it is
unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with this quiet, north-south trade explosion, the United
States now exports more to Canada than to all the countries of
Western Europe. More goods cross between Ontario and the United
States than are exchanged between the United States and Japan.
Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's foreign minister, said: ``We do more trade
through Windsor and Detroit than the U.S. does with Japan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Chretien was elected in 1993 on a platform of
skepticism about increasing economic integration with the United
States. Instead, he has presided over the fastest integration in
his country's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade between the U.S. and Canada has doubled in 10 years _
that is quite impressive when you think that we have been doing
business for more than 200 years,'' Gordon D. Giffin, the American
ambassador here, said in an interview. During the same decade,
world trade increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This trade boom has radically opened a country that once reveled
in its northern isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Since an auto pact was signed with the United States in 1965,
the portion of Canada's economy tied to foreign trade has tripled,
hitting 42 percent now. Measuring economic dependence on foreign
trade, Canada has climbed within the Group of Seven industrial
countries to second place, after Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For much of its history Canada has strived to create a cohesion
between east and west. But now each of Canada's 10 provinces trades
more with the United States than with the rest of Canada. In July,
87 percent of Canada's exports went south to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are seeing the Americanization of Canada, no doubt about
it,'' complained Peter S. Bleyer, executive director of the Council
of Canadians, a grass-roots nationalist group based here. ``Canada
is dramatically more integrated _ that is, dramatically more
dependent on the U.S. than we were a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since Wal-Mart opened its first Canadian
store, the American chain has become the Canada's largest retailer.
Noting this march of American franchises across Canada's suburban
landscape, Bleyer lamented: ``We are becoming more and more made in
the image of our elephant neighbor to the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the wishes of economic nationalists, Canada's speeding
economic links with the United States is eroding popular support
for such icons of sovereignty as border posts and a national
currency.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, in a poll of 1,204 Canadian adults, 52 percent said
they were ``optimistic'' about globalization, and 39 percent said
that border posts between Canada and the United States should be
torn down, allowing trade and traffic to flow freely in both
directions. In the poll, conducted by Ekos Research Associates,
only 17 percent were pessimistic about the economic impact of
integration.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, in poll of 1,500 Canadians, half of respondents
predicted that the United States and Canada would have a common
currency in 10 years, 77 percent said in 20 years. In the poll,
conducted by the Angus Reid Group Inc., 37 percent said that
abolition of the Canadian dollar would be good for Canada's
economy. Over the last five years, the Canadian dollar has lost 12
percent of its value, a contraction popular with exporters but
frustrating to Canadian travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's openness is reciprocated on the other side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Americans made almost 15 million overnight visits to
Canada. Last year, the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations
commissioned a survey of 1,507 American adults for a ``feelings
thermometer'' about 25 countries. Respondents had the warmest
feelings for Canada (72 degrees) followed by Britain (69 degrees)
and Italy (62 degrees). Ranking in the mid-50s were Mexico,
Germany, Brazil, Japan, Israel, France and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on these good feelings, academic specialists on
U.S.-Canada relations speculate that the next step toward fuller
integration could be a customs union _a European-style relationship
with common external tariffs and free internal movement of goods
and people.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and diplomats tend to be more cautious on
forecasting the evolution of North America's economic relations in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dialogue is mostly in the press and among academics,''
Giffin said in interview, referring to talk of a North American
currency. ``I don't see it much among policy-makers in the U.S. or
Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Most governmental efforts are concentrated on the mechanics of
maintaining trade relations. In the last six months, disputes over
several trade issues have been eased: restrictions on Canadian
companies advertising in foreign magazines and declining salmon
stocks in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Friday ``an agreement in principle'' was announced over exchange
of defense and aerospace technology. In a move that threatened
Canada's $6 billion a year military industry, the United States
threatened last April to impose a licensing system on defense
exports to Canada if Canada did not tighten its controls. Friday,
Canada promised to tighten its export control system, creating,
with the United States ``a strong North American perimeter for
defense export controls.''

JOHN MCLENDON, 84, STRATEGIST IN COLLEGE AND PRO BASKETBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio) (ko) 
 By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McLendon, a Hall of Fame basketball coach for college and
pro teams who studied under the sport's founder, Dr. James
Naismith, died Friday at his home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He
was 84.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon died of cancer of the pancreas, his wife, Joanna, said.
</P>
<P>
   In a coaching career that spanned almost seven decades, McLendon
became one of the most respected figures in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when few predominantly black schools had achieved
prominence at the national level and black coaches were almost
nonexistent, McLendon's all-black teams at North Carolina Central,
Tennessee State and Kentucky State were recognized for their
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   He was praised for an ability to teach fundamentals, maintain
his composure and devise strategy on the court as if his players
and the opposition were pieces in chess (one of his favorite
games).
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember about Coach McLendon was that he never
cursed, he never shouted,'' Dick Barnett, a player for McLendon at
Tennessee State University who went on to a successful career in
the National Basketball Association, said in a 1993 interview.
``You could just feel the resolution in his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   McLendon found a place in basketball lore with a game on March
12, 1944, in the era of Jim Crow laws, when his once-beaten,
all-black North Carolina Central team defeated an all-white Duke
University medical school team in a game staged in a locked gym,
without spectators, in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade later, McLendon's Tennessee State team,
unable to join the National Collegiate Athletic Association, became
the first school to win three consecutive National Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics titles from 1957 to 1959. Most of the
starters on those teams _ Barnett, John Barnhill, Ben Warley,
Porter Meriwether, Joe Buckhalter and Ron Hamilton _ played
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee State's achievement vindicated McLendon's faith in his
system. In 1951, he and four other representatives from black
institutions were invited to address an NCAA convention but were
told they could not attend the convention banquet or use the
elevators at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   McLendon coached in the National Industrial League, for the
Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League in 1961-62 and
for the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an outstanding basketball technician,'' Yankees' owner
George Steinbrenner, who as a 31-year-old owner of the Pipers hired
McLendon, said Friday. ``He had the respect of all his players and
produced nothing but winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee State's relentless all-court pressure and fast-break
tactics were the result of McLendon's intense conditioning program,
which included having his athletes run three miles every day before
the season and three miles every day before the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Championship miles,'' McLendon called them.
</P>
<P>
   John B. McLendon Jr. was born on April 5, 1915, in Kansas City,
Kan., and went with his brother to live in Colorado with
grandparents after his mother died.
</P>
<P>
   When his father remarried, he returned to Kansas, saw his first
basketball court in junior high school, and became so impressed
that he ran home and told his step-mother, ``I'm going to be a
basketball coach.''
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``No you're not. You're going to be a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But McLendon's future was sealed once he enrolled at the
University of Kansas and asked Naismith, who was retired but still
a member of the faculty at the school, to be his adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Naismith taught me far more than was found in textbooks,''
McLendon wrote three years ago. ``Very often he would put aside his
books and teach us lessons in life from his world experiences. And
that always included how he happened to invent the game of
basketball in 1891.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first black physical education student in the school,
McLendon was also a practice teacher at some segregated and
integrated schools in the area, and he used those experiences, as
well as Dr. Naismith's life lessons, to forge his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that my life would not have been anywhere
near what it has become if I had not had Dr. Naismith as my
adviser,'' McLendon said.
</P>
<P>
   After he left coaching, McLendon served as an athletic adviser
at Cleveland State University and was a frequent guest at
basketball clinics.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his second wife, Joanna, he is survived by a
daughter, Querida Banks of Silver Spring, Md.; two stepchildren,
Nanette Adams and David Bryant, both of Shaker Heights, Ohio; a
brother; two sisters; three grandchildren, and two
great-grandchildren. A son, John McLendon 3d, died two years ago.  &QL;

MEMPHIS MAYOR RE-ELECTED BY SURPRISINGLY WIDE MARGIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EMILY YELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ After one of the most raucous and highly
contested election campaigns in this city's history, voters have
given Mayor Willie Herenton a third term by a surprisingly decisive
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Herenton, who became the first black mayor of Memphis with a
narrow victory in 1991 and was re-elected handily with no serious
competition in 1995, triumphed again on Thursday with 45.7 percent
of the vote, in a field of 14 challengers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a Memphis mayoral election, the top two
contenders were black, with the City Council chairman, Joe Ford,
Herenton's closest competitor, drawing 25.1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of returns from precincts throughout the city suggested
that Herenton's support cut across racial lines in this city of
650,000 people, 55 percent of whom are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this election means in part that the evolution in race
relations in Memphis continues to improve,'' said Marcus Pohlmann,
a political science professor at Rhodes College. ``I don't know
whether we're ready to bury race as a factor in this city. I
suspect not. But this election showed that you continue to have a
significant number of whites who appear to be comfortable voting
for an African-American. And that is a change.''
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Herenton said: ``We must have a spirit of
unity that crosses race, politics and economics. That is what is
going to move Memphis on to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin of Herenton's victory in this election _ a
nonpartisan process, although the winner and the runner-up were
both Democrats _ surprised many here. Ford was considered the
mayor's most formidable opponent throughout the race, not so much
because of his own political record after five years on the City
Council as because of his family name.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ford's brothers, Harold E. Ford Sr., was Tennessee's
first black congressman and served 11 terms in the House before his
son, Harold Jr., replaced him three years ago. Another brother of
Joe Ford serves on the County Commission, and yet another is a
Tennessee state senator.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the mayoral race, Herenton called the Fords a
political machine that was ``not healthy for the body politic.''
But Joe Ford's resounding defeat has some calling into question the
family's longtime hold on power here.
</P>
<P>
   Pohlmann said the Ford family ``might have given the illusion
that they have more clout than they actually do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think many people might have overestimated the Ford family's
control in the black community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Steven Etheridge, a nonpartisan political
pollster, said he did not think the outcome of the election
signaled that the Fords' power had much diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be overstating it,'' Etheridge said. ``It is very
circumstantial. I think the black community did not want to run the
risk of eliminating a strong black mayor by voting for Joe Ford and
so letting a white candidate win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Thursday's result has brought speculation about the
viability of Harold Ford Jr.'s ambition to run next year against
Bill Frist, one of the state's two Republican senators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford, who has already made a preliminary tour of the state, was
involved in one of the nastiest flare-ups of his uncle's mayoral
campaign, in which he and other Ford supporters accused a Herenton
campaign worker of pulling a gun on them when they were putting up
Ford yard signs. Ford also recorded radio commercials attacking
Herenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to understand,'' Pohlmann said, ``why a sitting
congressman would risk alienating Democratic Herenton supporters by
getting himself involved in what was essentially a Democratic
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   In one bright spot for the Fords, yet another member of the
family, Edmund Ford, easily won the City Council seat that his
brother Joe vacated to run for mayor. That seat has been held by a
Ford family member since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lawler, professional wrestler turned politician, finished
a distant third in the mayoral race, with 11.7 percent of the vote.
Lawler had hoped for a Jesse Ventura-style jump from the wrestling
ring to the political arena, but his candidacy faltered, especially
after he was indicted on charges of attacking a police officer this
spring in a dispute over parking at the airport.

BUSH SAYS CASTRO FACES END OF REIGN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, basking in the
embrace of the political organization of his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush
of Florida, on Friday lambasted a favorite bogeyman of the Sunshine
State GOP, Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The two sons of former President Bush put on a warm display of
mutual admiration before the Texas governor dropped a spirited
denunciation of Castro into his regular presidential stump speech
for a crowd of several hundred supporters at the Florida Republican
convention.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, labeled Castro a ``revolutionary relic'' who faces the
end of his 40-year Communist rule. Bush indicated he could not
foresee lifting U.S. economic sanctions on Cuba as long as Castro
remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   After making his standard observation that freedom is the United
States' greatest export, Bush launched what was apparently the most
extensive public comments of his presidential campaign about the
Marxist regime of the island nation 90 miles off the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``This freedom must be spread throughout all the Americas. This
freedom is meant for all of our neighbors. And this freedom is
meant for Cuba,'' Bush said, setting off whoops of approval in a
crowded hotel ballroom where some of his backers stood for more
than an hour to await his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must and we will keep the sanctions against the Castro
regime until there is freedom of speech in Cuba, until there is
freedom of press in Cuba, until there is freedom of religion in
Cuba,'' Bush said. ``We will keep those sanctions until justice is
restored, political prisoners are set free and the exiles are
welcomed home.''
</P>
<P>
   Most foreign policy analysts believe few if any of those
conditions are likely to be met as long as Castro remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Cuba is ruled by a revolutionary relic at war with time
and at war with his people,'' Bush said. ``But history has always
disposed of tyrants, and Castro's day is coming. Cuba will be
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Cuban population has been a relatively reliable
supporter of Republicans since the waves of exiles began fleeing
Castro's regime in the early 1960s. More recently, however, younger
Cuban-Americans have been less faithful to the GOP than their
elders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Florida co-chairmen of the Bush presidential campaign
announced Friday by Jeb Bush was U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of
Miami, a Cuban-American political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the group were Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, Secretary of
State Katherine Harris, Senate President Tony Jennings and House
Speaker John Thrasher.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the lineup of GOP power assembled by the Florida
governor, the Texas governor told reporters before the rally: ``I'm
glad I was such a kind older brother.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed to detail how he would win Florida's primary in
March and carry the state's 25 electoral votes in November 2000 if
he's the nominee, candidate Bush said: ``I'm going to do everything
he tells me to do (pause), for the first time in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texan said _ with a grin _ that he had not even scratched
his brother off the list of prospective vice presidential running
mates, a line-up that almost certainly will include other
Republican governors. Earlier this year, the Bush brothers said
they would not consider being running mates.

Vice President Al Gore speaks with Tony Coehlo, his campaign

command for a meeting last April prospects for his presidential
campaign were looking good. Several people who played influential

LEGANZA A LOT OF CAR FOR THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Daewoo who? For most people, that is the question when it
comes to South Korea's least-known automaker.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least on these shores. In its home country, Daewoo Group is
one of the giants of manufacturing and finance, its automotive
division only part of a domain that includes shipbuilding,
appliances, electronics, credit cards and construction.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, however, mention that you're driving a Daewoo
Leganza and you're likely to get a blank stare. That or a huge
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Really, Daewoo Leganza is a name that doesn't exactly roll off
the tongue. Most people say it the way W.C. Fields might have said
it. Besides, Leganza sounds like some kind of leafy vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   What Leganza is, however, is a nice, conservative, midsize sedan
with an attractive, roomy interior that's loaded with features. It
also drives quite well. Nothing spectacular, but certainly a lot of
car for the money.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is really the story here. Totally dressed out,
with a decent interior, full power accesso ries, a good stereo,
leather seating, modular 16-inch wheels with per formance tires,
sunroof, automatic transmission, climate control and a nice paint
job, the Leganza still hits less than $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's job is to get the word out. The Korean automaker has
had a hard time breaking into the Ameri can market for various
reasons, primarily because of quality concerns about South Korean
cars, notably the first generation of Hyundais. They sold like
hotcakes, until owners discovered that they were highly
self-destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, South Korean companies have established more of a U.S.
presence with Hyundai pretty much redeemed and Kia rapidly selling
its cute Sportage minisport-utility vehicle, among other things.
Financially, they're still in the hopper, but at least their cars
work well.
</P>
<P>
   For Daewoo, establishing a dealer network has been elusive, with
many false starts and disappointments. At one point, the company
was trying to enlist college students to sell cars through word of
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still targeting young buyers, offering a creative
loan pro gram and guaranteed resale value to college students.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Leganza, it feels like a good driver, although I did
have a few concerns. For instance, just as I was beginning to like
this car, I had one lame experience: closing the electric sunroof,
I was startled by a loud ``crack!'' as a plastic piece broke off
and landed on my head.
</P>
<P>
   Probably just a fluke in the test car, but it did give me pause.
There were some chintzy bits in an otherwise handsome interior,
including screws that showed in the armrests and a flimsy feel to
the console and cu pholders.
</P>
<P>
   Leganza is the flagship of a trio of Daewoo cars, with the Lanos
at the budget end of the scale starting at $8,000, and Nubira _ an
all-wheel-drive four-door hatchback _ in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Leganza's styling is elegant, well-pro portioned and enhanced
with a chrome grille that mimics the com pany logo. Smart stuff
when building a brand image.
</P>
<P>
   A four-cylinder is the only engine available for Leganza, which
could present a problem as it tries to break into the mainstream of
a midsize market dominated by powerful V-6s. The Daewoo engine is a
decent performer, particularly smooth and quiet in freeway
cruising, but dis playing a four-banger's harshness under
acceleration. For 131 horse power, pickup is brisk.
</P>
<P>
   The Leganza seems solid and well-built, with decent cornering
ability and good brakes _ disc on all four wheels and with standard
antilock. The steering is responsive and fairly precise.
</P>
<P>
   In purely subjective terms, you won't mistake the Leganza's
driveability for that of a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry, although
it seems like a reasonable compromise consider ing the price.
Another consideration is that Daewoo has no track record for
reliability in the United States, so it's also a gamble on how well
it holds up.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of lingering quality concerns, all Daewoos come
with three-year, 36,000-mile roadside as sistance, a major perk
usually re served for luxury vehicles, and free scheduled
maintenance (including oil changes) and a bumper-to-bumper warranty
for the same time period. There's also a 6-year, 50,000-mile
powertrain warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo is unique among automak ers in the United States, with
all its dealerships owned by the corpora tion. The first and only
dealership in Arizona is Daewoo of Tempe, which opened in August.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Daewoo should be a decent seller, offering a
fairly so phisticated product for less than you'd expect. The
Leganza is one of those ``champagne taste/beer budget'' cars that
might be inexpen sive to own but won't feel cheap to you or your
passengers. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: THE THUMB HURTS, AND SO DO SOME WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Piazza got his left thumb in the way of a baseball; Bobby
Valentine lodged his foot in his mouth _ again. Steve Phillips, the
Mets' general manager, called the latter ``an ill-timed fire,'' but
he declined to compare its potential impact to the Piazza ailment.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the New York Mets playing the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Friday night and trying to win their division
series, Phillips was asked before the game which was the more
ill-timed: the inflammatory reaction Piazza had to a cortisone shot
for his thumb, or Valentine's comments about his players and one of
his coaches as quoted in a Sports Illustrated article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Phillips said, obviously opting not to answer, ``I have
feelings about it. But I don't feel my feelings have to be shared
with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Mets were trying to generate another winning streak
that would catapult them into the National League Championship
Series, they encountered trouble and distraction. Neither could
help.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's thumb and his forced absence from the third game of the
tied series undoubtedly would have a greater impact. A team doesn't
lose its starting catcher and No. 1 home &UR; - &LR; run hitter and run
producer without noticing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' Al Leiter, the Mets' scheduled starting pitcher
for Saturday afternoon's Game 4, said before Friday night's game.
``Crazy stuff like this happens where you don't expect something
from somebody. I hope Todd Pratt is the hero tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, the seldom-used reserve, replaced Piazza in the lineup.
There apparently is no substitute for common sense. Otherwise, why
would a manager say to a reporter for a national, or any,
publication that he has ``about five guys in there right now who
basically are losers''?
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said the article contained two inaccuracies, but he
didn't deny that he made that particular statement. He said he
would talk to his players about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might just say if any shoes fit, wear them,'' he related,
standing at the batting cage during batting practice. ``If not,
don't worry about it. I don't think anybody will worry about it.
It's an issue because it's New York and Bobby Valentine. Otherwise
it's a nonissue. Everything that's said there has been said a
thousand times about teams and players. It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But managers don't usually say it about their players, certainly
not when they're trying to get to the playoffs. ``I'm supposed to
call the editor and tell him when to write the story?'' Valentine
said when he was asked about the timing.
</P>
<P>
   But he has tried to play editor before. In spring training this
year he objected to an article in The New York Times in which Todd
Hundley, the Mets' former catcher, spoke harshly of his former
manager. Valentine complained that there was nothing new in
Hundley's comments and that the only reason for writing it was that
the reporter had a vendetta against him.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine doesn't need anyone raising questions about him; he
does the best job of that himself. For example, a couple of weeks
ago, after he said that he shouldn't return next season if the Mets
didn't reach the playoffs, he described the remark as spontaneous.
His wife said earlier this week that they discussed it the night
before.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips this year has periodically had to put out brush fires
that Valentine lighted. ``We've had a lot of timing issues this
year,'' the general manager said. ``The timing's not great, but at
this point it's irrelevant.'' In other words, the comment was in
print; nothing to be done to delete it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope,'' Phillips said, ``is we can avert a distractive
state from the players and that it won't distract them and they'll
be able to focus on what we're trying to do.'' He added a minute
later: ``I think that Bobby is an emotional person. It's part of
what makes him very good at what he does and at times it's the
thing that gets him in trouble with the things that he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips added that he ``would rather be getting fired up that
Rick Reed's going to pitch a great game tonight and we're going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's presence in the lineup would very likely have aided
that endeavor, though in the first two games he had twice as many
strikeouts (four) as hits (two). Buck Martinez, a former catcher
turned broadcaster, said disclosure of the thumb injury put
Piazza's hitting problems in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Catching pitches with an injured thumb, Martinez explained,
``tears you up,'' adding: ``Now it becomes a factor because it's
your power hand on the bat. You think back on it and it explains
itself. The bad sliders he swung at against Todd Stottlemyre _ you
think about starting the bat because you know it's going to bark a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said he hoped the inflammation would subside sufficiently
so he could play Saturday, but Martinez said catching Leiter would
not be beach volleyball for Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ball sinks so much and you get in between turning it this
way and turning it that way,'' Martinez said, moving his hand back
and forth as if he were catching pitches. ``It's tough to get
over,'' he added about the injury. ``You don't get over it real
quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it takes people time to recover from Valentine's
comments, too.

GRAND CANYON FLIGHT BILL GUTTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX - Noise restrictions at the Grand Canyon, caps on the
number of air-tour flights, and a curfew on flights at sunrise and
sunset could all be gutted under a bill pushed through the Senate
this week by Arizona Sen. John McCain.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aides to the Republican presidential candidate said the bill is
intended as a ``shot across the bow'' of the Clinton
administration, which Mc Cain maintains has dragged its feet in
establishing rules for so-called ``quiet technology'' aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and members of the Clinton administration
believe that industry-backed ``quiet technol ogy'' is not the
answer to restoring periods of silence to the Canyon, but McCain
has supported it as a way to make the skies there less noisy
without banning air flights alto gether.
</P>
<P>
   John Raidt, the McCain campaign's policy director, tried to
reassure critics, saying McCain ``is not going to let something go
into law that would end up making the Canyon noisier.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Arnberger, superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park,
joined environmentalists Oct. 8 in warning that the measure will
have the unintended consequence of gutting years of work toward
establishing McCain's own long-sought goal of returning ``natural
quiet'' to the nation's most popular natural attrac tion.
</P>
<P>
   Late Oct. 5, in an amendment to a bill reauthorizing the Federal
Avia tion Administration, McCain re quired the agency to define
what is a ``quiet aircraft'' within nine months.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure says that if the agency fails to do this, ``any
aircraft shall be considered to be in compli ance.''
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft that are deemed to be ``quiet'' could run an unlimited
number of flights and fly during the sunrise/sunset curfews
established as a result of McCain's landmark 1987 Grand Canyon
Overflights Act.
</P>
<P>
   McCain press secretary Nancy Ives said the amendment would apply
only to aircraft that replaced existing planes and helicopters in
the fleets of the nearly two dozen firms that fly tours over the
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But because all aircraft would be deemed ``quiet,'' both
environmen talists and park officials say, the air-tour industry
could swap out aircraft at random and be in compli ance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a quiet airplane or helicopter,
according to Superintendent Arnberger.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's measure presumes, incorrectly, that quieter
aircraft will reduce noise at the Canyon, Arnber ger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not silent. They're just less noisy, and they are
noisy,'' Arnber ger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment allows a free-for-all for all aircraft over the
Grand Canyon so long as they meet some definition for quiet
aircraft,'' the superintendent said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Bassett, president of the U.S. Air Tour Association, a
Maryland lobbying group that represents 55 air-tour and related
firms, including most that fly over the Grand Can yon, said he was
aware of McCain's amendment, but he refused to dis cuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett's group has worked to ensure that the federal agency
maintains control of the airspace over the nation's 52 national
parks, fearing that the National Park Service would ban all air
tours if given the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Raidt, who has worked as McCain's environmental policy point-man
for more than a decade, said the sena tor's passage of the 1987
Overflights Act, which bans aircraft below the rim and restricts
them to certain flight corridors, ``is the flagship of John
McCain's environmental re cord.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain would do nothing to jeopar dize that legislation, Raidt
said, noting that it was McCain who proded the Justice Department
in recent years to seek fines from air-tour operators who had
refused to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in park-tour fees.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists have called McCain the Canyon's
staunchest defender in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Rob Smith of the Sierra Club wonders why McCain is
pushing the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wording of the amendment virtually eliminates all the
progress made so far since 1987,'' he said. ``The only ones who
would hear a quiet Canyon would be those who hike at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft that employ quiet tech nology simply produce noise for
up to nine miles in every direction, instead of 16 miles, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal in most of the Canyon should be to listen to the
Canyon, and not to airplanes.'' &QL;

<P>
   BALI, China _ In a crumbling mud-brick house, nestled against
the untidy heap that holds her family's entire wardrobe, Zheng
Xingrong defines her life with a series of emphatic negatives.
</P>
<P>
   How often do your children eat eggs or meat? ``Never!'' Do you
have a radio or television? ``No!'' Is your 14-year-old daughter in
school? ``No!'' Does your 8-year-old boy have any toys? ``None!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have no money, we don't dare to have any dreams,''
said the 40-year-old woman, whose family is one of the poorest in a
destitute farming village north of the Yellow River in Shandong
province.
</P>
<P>
   Only three hours away by car, in Hongyuan village, near the city
of Jinan, Li Huazhu, 45, and his wife Chen Xuerong, 39 _ farmers
until a few years ago _ proudly show off the former gas station
site they just bought with cash. It will house their expanding
company, which makes precision-ground granite slabs to export for
industrial use.
</P>
<P>
   Their 17-year-old son has some very big toys _ a videodisc
player and a motorbike _ and their 18-year-old daughter is in
nursing school. Ms. Chen dreams of the day, not so distant, when
they can buy a car and build their own two-story house. ``No,'' her
husband interjects, ``a three-story house!''
</P>
<P>
   Between one family's despair and another family's dreams lies a
serious new problem for China, the rapid growth in economic
disparities. In the booming 1990s, yawning gaps opened between city
and countryside, between the developed coast and the isolated
interior, between upper and lower classes in the cities and, as
these two families illustrate, between richer and poorer villages.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the extent to which popular resentment of
inequality may be a source of unrest in a country that is already
struggling with slowed growth, high unemployment and bitterness
over official corruption. But the trend itself is striking.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   From comparative income equality in the mid-1980s, China in the
last decade has suddenly emerged as one of the most unequal
countries in Asia, surpassing countries like India and Indonesia,
according to reports by the World Bank and others. China's
disparities surpass those of the United States and Western Europe,
though they do not approach the extremes of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mounting inequality and its possible consequences, both for
social and economic stability and for continued growth, have become
central issues of policy debate and scholarly research,'' said Hu
Angang, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wang
Shaoguang, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong
Kong, in their new book, ``The Political Economy of Uneven
Development: The Case of China'' (M.E. Sharpe).
</P>
<P>
   Still, public debate inside China about the growing disparities
remains muted, in part because the official line remains that
economic trailblazers will pull up everyone else and that the
government is fully addressing any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, as China switched from Mao Tse-tung's failed
socialism toward a more open, market-oriented economy, some rise in
inequality was expected and even desired. Deng Xiaoping, mastermind
of the reforms, famously said, ``Let some prosper first, so that
others may follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic loosening produced blistering growth and,
especially in the early years, widely shared improvements. The
climb from penury for hundreds of millions of rural people through
family farming and the spread of rural industry has been one of
modern China's greatest feats.
</P>
<P>
   But few anticipated the surging disparities of the 1990s, as the
top urban and rural groups sped ahead. One study, by Dwayne
Benjamin and Loren Brandt of the University of Toronto, found rural
inequality as great as in the feudal 1930s, although at higher
levels for all.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these scholars found, it is access to nonfarm jobs in
rural and township industries or the cities, rather than grossly
skewed land-holdings, that has allowed some to forge ahead. Rural
areas nearest to cities _ like Hongyuan village, outside Shandong's
capital, Jinan _ have done especially well.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, rural economic growth has fallen far behind
that of the cities _ and is likely to keep sputtering without major
changes in policy, economists say, because agriculture is in a rut
and many rural industries are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, there is evidence that progress against the most severe
poverty slowed during a period of fantastic national growth. Since
the late '80s the reduction of rural poverty ``was far less than it
would have been had the growth in rural income inequality been
avoided,'' conclude Carl Riskin of Columbia University and Azizur
Khan of the University of California in a study being published by
Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Still trapped at rock-bottom today are some 124 million Chinese,
living below the World Bank's poverty standard of $1 a day in per
capita income. According to the government's more stringent
definition, there are 42 million Chinese below the poverty line.
Whatever the definition, China's poorest people are concentrated in
crowded, eroded mountain lands in the south and the north and in
pockets elsewhere, like the region of poor soils and little
industry around Bali.
</P>
<P>
   Now, too, an urban underclass is emerging for the first time in
recent history, mainly unemployed workers and elderly people with
minimal pensions and no prosperous relatives to help out.
</P>
<P>
   The government has special policies to aid the poor and reduce
inequality, including small welfare payments for destitute city
dwellers, rural anti-poverty projects and incentives for investment
in inland provinces.
</P>
<P>
   But harming the rural areas in particular are two policies that
seem unlikely to be reversed any time soon: the tight controls on
the ability of villagers to move to cities and compete for jobs,
and a national policy of self-sufficiency in grain, under which
farmers are forced to grow grains when they often could make far
more growing fruits and vegetables.

VAN RAAPHORSE SICK OF BEING HOT TOPIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst has not
always fared well in hot weather but expects to change that trend
today.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Van Raaphorst experienced flu-like symptoms before
the season opener with Purdue, when the field temperature reached
118 degrees. He also experienced nausea and was forced to sit out
most of the Florida State game.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst said he's sure he won't suffer a relapse today
against Arizona, because his family doctor said anti-cramping pills
caused his nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. USC does not endorse the use of
anti-cramping pills except in extreme cases, which would not
include Van Raaphorst. There is still speculation that Van
Raaphorst's problems were psychological.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Van Raaphorst is confident he will be healthy
against the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of that stuff, I'm good to go,'' Van Raaphorst said.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said he plans to use more players today
because the kickoff temperature is expected to reach 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to play some guys and give guys a break,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the expected changes is to use freshman tailback Sultan
McCullough more to keep starter Chad Morton fresh.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hostile crowd: USC linebacker Zeke Moreno has never played in
Arizona Stadium, but that doesn't mean he isn't familiar with the
atmosphere on game days. Moreno came here to watch his brother,
Moses, play quarterback for Colorado State against the Wildcats in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the way the fans can be because we had on Colorado
State shirts and stuff. It's a hostile place,'' Moreno said. ``The
only memory I have is my brother playing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State won 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   __ Seeking help: Because Hackett has never faced Arizona, he
asked his assistants for even more input than usual this week.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Hue Jackson coached at Arizona State and
California before coming to USC in 1997. Offensive line coach Steve
Greatwood spent most of his career at Oregon, and tight ends coach
Steve Morton was at Washington before being hired by Hackett last
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very fortunate that we've got three people that have
played against this defense many times before,'' Hackett said. ``So
I'm sitting back and listening to them. I'm going to rely heavily
on them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Controversial call: Washington State is bitter about losing
to Arizona two weeks ago 30-24 on a clearly botched call on the
last play of the game, when wide receiver Bobby Wade ``caught'' a
42-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   What made the play particularly galling to Washington State is
that side judge Jerry Gastellum, who made the call, is from Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   __ Some weaknesses: Arizona's unimpressive start can be
explained by one key stat: The Wildcats' defense is allowing 5
yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, Texas Christian and Stanford exposed this weakness,
rushing for 262, 224 and 214 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear about missed tackles,'' Hackett said. ``I don't know
how a great defense starts missing tackles, but I don't buy that.''

 BALI: and vegetables.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bali, a village of 300 families and 1,300 people, is in a county
that authorities only last year declared to have been lifted above
the official government poverty line, set at a per-person income of
about $220 a year.
</P>
<P>
   A large group of residents, gathered in front of Ms. Zheng's
home, laughed on hearing about that official milestone. ``An entire
family here doesn't earn $220,'' one man said, and that includes
money brought home by migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   In all the village, just three people have bought motor scooters
and about 70 percent of families have small black-and-white
televisions. The mud and straw homes have floors of packed earth.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that perhaps the farmers do not fully calculate the
value of their subsistence crops, but other signs point to an
insecure, nearly hand-to-mouth existence. Each family has less than
an acre of land to farm, and the soils, cropped with wheat and then
corn every year, are salty and low-yielding.
</P>
<P>
   Each year every family must hand over 100 kilograms _ about 220
pounds _ of grain, close to half their produce, to the local
government, residents said, in payment of obligations they are not
sure about. For most families, the remaining grain provides just
enough to eat through the year, with some of the wheat traded for a
paste made from freshwater shrimp. There is rarely any surplus left
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Families owe another $15 in various fees each year, residents
said, and must also pay other fees for every child in school.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that keeps families here going is the money
earned by men who spend a few months each summer _ leaving when the
corn is knee-high and returning at harvest time _ working in
highway construction around the city of Tianjin or along Shandong's
prosperous coast. There, they can save about $60 each month.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why Ms. Zheng's family is especially bad off is that
her husband has asthma and has not been able to earn much in
distant labor. He does not go to the clinic, she said, ``unless he
has really serious trouble breathing,'' because it costs $5 a
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The family keeps six chickens and a pig in the front yard, but
all eggs and meat must be sold, and day after day they eat either
bread and shrimp paste or boiled turnips.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zheng's brother-in-law, 34-year-old Luo Huicheng, thought he
had a way to break through last year when he saw low prices for
feed grains and good prices for pork. Encouraged by county
agricultural agents, in July of 1998 he borrowed $2,100 to build
concrete sties and buy 30 pigs.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of other farmers around
China had the same idea and in a classic cycle, overproduction
caused pork prices to plummet. In front of his empty sty, Luo
described his feelings earlier this year, as he watched prices fall
below his costs, and then fall more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so helpless,'' he recalled. ``I'd built the sty. I'd
bought the pigs. I just wished they would hurry up and grow!'' He
sold the pigs for $600, and worked at construction jobs to start
repaying his loan.

TROJANS CAN'T AFFORD TO GET LOST IN DESERT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; TUCSON, Ariz. _ The loss to Oregon was devastating. The victory
over Oregon State somewhat embarrassing. But through those two
less-than-desired results, USC is surviving and clinging to its
preseason goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long way to go to get to the Rose Bowl, but we're
making small steps at this point,'' USC tailback Chad Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 22-ranked Trojans will take a giant leap today when they
face Arizona at 12:30 p.m. The only mystery is whether it will be a
step forward or backward?
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot lose again if we want to go to the Rose Bowl,''
Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   A couple weeks removed from their triple-overtime loss to
Oregon, the Trojans (3-1, 1-1) are hitting the road again, needing
an elusive victory in a hostile stadium to keep their aspirations
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to explain what kind of game this is. We've
played on the road, played our hearts and (thrown) it away,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Trojans need to finally earn a road victory
instead of collectively shaking their heads afterwards, which
usually happens on these excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point of the year where a team should take
shape,'' Hackett said. ``For the most part, we're getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all that is left is to prove it. Morton, who gained a
career-high 153 yards last weekend, believes he has figured out
where the Trojans' fortunes rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the (offensive) line that will determine how far the team
goes,'' Morton said. ``I think it's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a key area, all right, because the line remains in flux.
A finally healthy Trevor Roberts is gaining ground on starter Brent
McCaffrey at left tackle, and left guard is being filled by
sophomore Faasea Mailo because starter Donta Kendrick has a badly
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   At center, senior Matt McShane is expected to play an entire
game because starter Eric Denmon has been slowed by tendinitis in
his knees. Denmon returns today, but McShane will get most of the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the offensive line to pick up where it left off last
year, but it took a while to get going and that's just the
process,'' Hackett said. ``We saw a spark in the (Oregon State)
game where we're going to be a pretty good running team &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . If
we can get the running game going, I'm going to be very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say excited? That's something few people have been
in Tucson since late August, when Arizona took a 41-7 thumping from
Penn State and saw its national-championship hopes evaporate.
Nearly everything else was lost following a stunning 50-22 setback
to Stanford three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, (the expectations) probably weren't realistic,''
Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. ``I knew we were overrated a little
bit, but I hoped we would rise to the occasion and play over our
heads, and we haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (3-2, 1-1) still have a chance to make it to the
Rose Bowl, which is why this game is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had a week off, they've worked on fundamentals and
they'll probably play like gangbusters,'' Hackett said. ``I think
we're going to play the best team we've played this year. They were
slated as the favorites and I don't think that information was too
far off.''
</P>

 &HT;    Web may be found in tiny places
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The technology driving the Internet's next big growth
spurt may be as tiny as the tip of a match.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fall 1999 Internet World conference, which wrapped up
here Friday, a handful of companies pushed what they believe is the
next big advance in Internet computing _ tiny World Wide Web
servers embedded in clothing, jewelry and even household
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the post-PC age,'' proclaimed Jack Powers of the
International Informatics Institute, an Internet-related research
company. ``The Internet is expanding off the desktop and leaking
into the fabric of our lives. We'll be immersed in connectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   And that full Internet integration can happen without the
clutter of clunky servers. Powers described a minute,
matchtip-sized Web server that, when built into any device, can
create smarter appliances empowered by the rich content available
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The IPic technology, designed and used by University of
Massachusetts researchers, is just a piece of the puzzle. Powers
described a future in which the processors already present in
things such as cars, watches and security systems connect to the
Net. Service providers such as GoAmerica are giving Web access to
wireless phones and tiny handheld computers, and researchers say
home appliances are a logical next step in using the power of
information to enhance functionality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make these devices smarter,'' said Michael Nelson,
chief executive of emWare Inc., which makes software that runs
Internet-enabled devices. ``We just need a server that can talk to
the Web _ we don't need to cram a Pentium in there.''
</P>
<P>
   At a forum showcasing so-called smart appliances, Powers
introduced a prototype of a Web-enabled microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   A scanner lets the oven read barcodes, which it uses to
recognize a product and download cooking instructions. On a 10-inch
touch-screen on the microwave door, the computer chip creates a
shopping list, helps create recipes or lets the user navigate the
Web. It also performs limited online banking functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These appliances have to be simple, with an application that's
appropriate to the context in which they exist,'' said Stephen
Emmott of NCR Knowledge Labs, which designed the prototype. ``The
kitchen is a hub of activity and information, but people don't want
a whole PC in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegro Software Development Corp. used a small Lego house to
show what Internet connectivity could do for home security.
</P>
<P>
   By embedding Web servers in motion detectors and other home
security features, a homeowner who is traveling can use any PC to
alter the frequency and times that lights turn on and off, and
track any motion inside their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone's really watching a house, they notice if the same
lights come on like clockwork every night,'' said Edward Steinfeld,
who handles Allegro's marketing.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a growing core of interest in Internet-embedded
appliances and other systems.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 million Americans would buy Internet-enabled devices if
they were available today, up 31 percent from last year, according
to online market research company Cyber Dialogue Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Of that 27 million, a surprising 54 percent log onto the
Internet only rarely, if ever, the study showed _ something
researcher Thomas Miller said stems more from a fascination with
gadgets than with the Web itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want things that are cool but easy to use,'' Miller
said. ``That poses new challenges for the industry. People want
fun, not complexity or big, heavy Web servers.'' During futuristic
fashion shows during Internet World, InfoCharm Inc. showcased
prototypes for badges and headsets that offer hands-free Internet
and e-mail access. Some sets included Web viewing tools that attach
to glasses, one-handed keyboards and keypads built into the fabric
of a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, InfoCharm wants to create a wireless, wearable Web
device that's as much an afterthought as jewelry and watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at clocks _ they used to fill buildings until someone
started making them smaller and smaller,'' said Russ Hoffman, an
InfoCharm hardware engineer. ``At first people balked at wearing a
clock, a machine, on their arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, everyone wears them as necessary accessories.''

ALI WINS, BUT FIGHT ISN'T THE GREATEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, N.Y. _ With her father sitting ringside on Friday night
at the Turning Stone Casino ballroom, Laila Ali, the youngest
daughter of Muhammad Ali, stepped into the ring to continue the
legacy. And just like her father, Laila Ali made quick work of her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Ali, making her boxing debut, knocked out April
Fowler with a left-right combination at 31 seconds of the first
round and then stood over Fowler, yelling for her to get up and
fight.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same pose that her father struck when he stood over a
fallen Sonny Liston in their rematch in 1965 in Lewiston, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Laila Ali posed for pictures and then leaned through
the ropes and got a kiss from her father, who smiled proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali entered the ballroom about 45 minutes before his
daughter stepped into the ring. He arrived to a great ovation. He
walked slowly to his seat at ringside, the tremors from Parkinson's
disease making his gait unsteady. He was accompanied by his wife,
Lonnie, and Laila's sister Hana.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica, Laila's mother and Ali's third wife, sat on the
opposite side of the ring. Veronica and Muhammad Ali were divorced
when Laila was 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali's presence created a huge buzz in the building and
overshadowed his daughter's ring debut. But it also indicated that
he was throwing his support behind her, even though he does not
agree with her desire to box.
</P>
<P>
   Ali sat expressionless as his daughter entered the ring draped
in a long white robe. He kept eyeing her opponent warily. But there
was no reason to.
</P>
<P>
   When she is not training, Laila Ali runs a nail salon in Los
Angeles. She hit upon the idea of boxing for a living a year ago
when she went to the L.A. Boxing Gym to work out.
</P>
<P>
   Ali said she was not athletic as a child. She never played
sports, although she said she believed she had inherited her
father's boxing ability. But she said she was tough, and frequently
fought to protect herself and her older sister, Hana. She said she
was not worried about getting popped in the face or having her nose
bloodied.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed she had very little to fear in that regard, heading
into her debut bout against Fowler. Fowler, 27, is a divorced
mother of two from Michigan City, Ind. She doesn't have an amateur
background, but she had three fights in the Tough Woman contest.
</P>
<P>
   In her first professional bout Fowler was stopped in first round
on a technical knockout. She was knocked down twice before the bout
was stopped. That was 18 months ago. She said she kept training,
waiting for a fight. But she appeared to be pudgy around the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fight Ali had said that her opponents would be
surprised by her power and her boxing ability. She said the most
frustrating thing at this early stage of her boxing career is that
she is unable to execute the things that she wants to do in the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to tell exactly what skill level Ali has, based
on her performance against Fowler, who closed her eyes when she
threw a punch and turned her head when Ali was throwing jabs at
her. Ali managed to land a couple of stiff jabs as Fowler ran
around the ring. But Fowler flopped so fast that it was pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no tapes of her,'' said Michael Acri, the promoter,
who admitted that Fowler was bad. ``There was no way of knowing.
All I knew is that she had one pro fight and three Tough Woman
fights.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors in New York charged a Tanzanian
man Friday with helping to carry out the bombing of the U.S.
Embassy in his country last year, which along with a nearly
simultaneous attack in Nairobi, Kenya, killed more than 200 people
and injured thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Khalfan Khamis Mohamed, 26, was arrested in Cape
Town, South Africa, this week and flown to New York, where he was
arraigned Friday before a U.S. district judge in Manhattan.

   Mohamed entered a plea of not guilty to the charges, which also
accuse him of conspiring with others in an international terrorist
organization led by Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden is the Saudi exile
who is suspected by authorities of masterminding the embassy
attacks. He remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed is the first of the nine fugitives indicted in the case
to be arrested, and the first defendant in custody in New York to
be accused of a direct operational role in planning and carrying
out the attack in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 11. Others
in custody in New York are accused of carrying out the attack in
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to the bombings of Aug. 7, 1998, the
indictments charge, Mohamed rented a house in Dar es Salaam that
the conspirators used as their base of operations and also as a
bomb factory.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes after the explosion, Mohamed photographed the
embassy ruins from inside a Suzuki Samurai, which he had rented for
use in the plot, the indictment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said Mohamed had
been living in Cape Town under an assumed name, and that his arrest
should serve as ``a stark reminder to all of those who played any
role in the horrific terrorist bombings of our embassies'' that
authorities ``literally around the world will not stop
investigating, searching, capturing, and prosecuting until all
responsible are brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the New York office of the FBI, Lewis Schiliro,
said that the investigation leading to the arrest of Mohamed
included months of ``old-fashioned, persistent and dogged police
work'' by agents of the FBI and New York police detectives who had
gone to Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Mohamed might be in Cape Town, the
investigators did an exhaustive records check, and confirmed his
identity and location. Although the officials refused to say how
they had learned Mohamed was in the country, a South African
official said that the suspect had fled to the country a few days
after the bombings, and had entered illegally under the false name
Zahran Nassor Maulid.
</P>
<P>
   Sipho Ngwema, a spokesman for South Africa's Office of the
National Director of Public Prosecutions, said in a phone interview
Friday night that Mohamed had applied for political asylum in South
Africa under pretenses, and was granted a temporary permit.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested on Tuesday after he went for a scheduled visit
to an immigration office to extend his temporary permit, Ngwema
said, and was then turned over to American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ngwema said that Mohamed had stayed out of trouble in Cape Town
as he sought to ``assume his new identity.'' He kept a low profile
and was apparently working in a fast-food restaurant in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   Ngwema said that South African authorities had turned up no
evidence linking Mohamed to the bombing of a Planet Hollywood
restaurant in Cape Town in August 1998, shortly after the United
States shot missiles into Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for
the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In court Friday, Mohamed sat quietly in blue prison clothes,
speaking softly in English when Judge Leonard Sand asked whether he
had understood the nature of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual exchange, Mohamed twice said no, that he did
not understand the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sand asked, ``What is it that you don't understand, Mr.
Mohamed?''
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed replied, ``No, I do understand _ things which used to
make a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment drew raised eyebrows around the courtroom, but it
was not clear whether he was admitting that he had knowledge of how
to make a bomb, or merely understood that it was one of the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Mohamed appeared relaxed, at times resting
his face in his hands, and smiling occasionally at his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the government, Sand ordered Mohamed held
without bail and under the same strict jail conditions as the five
other defendants in custody in the Metropolitan Correctional
Institution in lower Manhattan, who are barred from communicating
with virtually all outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   If Mohamed is convicted of the charges, he could face the death
penalty, Ms. White said Friday. The lawyer appointed to represent
Mohamed, Jeremy Schneider, said by phone Friday night that he had
no comment on the case.

SPECIAL PLANS FOR ENGLISH

<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, Mont. _ Mark this down: If the Cal State Northridge
football team upsets Montana today, Kwasi English's first trip here
will be memorable.
</P>
<P>
   English, a reserve cornerback, promised Friday to scale the hill
behind Montana's Washington-Grizzly Stadium, up to where there is a
large ``M'' imprinted in white letters.
</P>
<P>
   English, a senior, might as well make the most of his second
road game this season. He didn't travel to CSUN's Big Sky
Conference opener at Eastern Washington on Sept. 25 but might have
earned this trip because of his fourth-quarter blocked punt against
Idaho State last week at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sweating right now,'' English said after practice Friday
night at Washington-Grizzly Stadium. ``I'm just trying to control
my adrenaline, so I can have some (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, said English provides
depth in a secondary depleted by injuries to Hassan Abdul-Malik and
Dwan Vance. But English's special-teams ability is also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proven he can block a kick,'' Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Decision time: Kearin has a decision to make today who will
return punts: Terrence Jones, who is averaging 9.5 yards per return
but has a bad hamstring, or Steve Forte, who hasn't returned one
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Forte) is not as good at catching the ball,'' Kearin said.
``We'll mix it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte is CSUN's starting strong safety. He is third on the team
with 26 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Making the call: Freshman wide receiver Greg Orlando, who
hasn't caught a pass this season, has a sore right wrist and might
redshirt. Orlando has broken the wrist three times.
</P>
<P>
   __ Weather report: It sprinkled at the end of CSUN's practice at
Washington-Grizzly Stadium on Friday night, but the forecast for
today is a high in the mid-60s and clear skies.

 &HT;    Mets pound Diamondbacks 9-2
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ The New York Mets blew open the League Division
Friday night with an unproven and delicate maneuver: park Mike
Piazza's pantaloons on the pine.
</P>
<P>
   Weird science. With their catcher sidelined by a sore left
thumb, the Mets turned merciless, strafing Arizona for 11 hits and
a 9-2 victory on the kind of night that breaks a lesser club's
spirit. The Diamondbacks responded by committing three errors and
walking eight. With a two games-to-one lead, New York sends out Al
Leiter this afternoon to nail down an NLCS berth for a wild card
team most left for dead two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   New York salted it away with a six-run sixth, which reliever
Darren Holmes set into motion with a pair of walks. Rickey
Henderson dropped an RBI single into shallow right and after
Edgardo Alfonzo was intentionally walked to load the bases, John
Olerud greeted reliever Dan Plesac with a two-run single for a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton, the ninth man to bat in the inning finished it
off with a two-run single off Dan Plesac as the Diamondback bullpen
allowed seven base runners and four hits for the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets made such big noise without Piazza, who was scratched
earlier in the day after his sore left thumb ballooned from a
cortisone injection. Piazza, who hits 40 homers with 124 remains
questionable for today's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona starter Omar Daal was lifted after giving up six hits
and three runs in four innings and the move paid an immediate
dividend. Pinch-hitter Turner Ward made the first postseason hit of
his 10-year career count with a two-run homer in the fifth to close
the gap to 3-2. The runs represented the first Mets starter Rick
had surrendered in 14 innings, dating back to Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   New York increased its lead to 3-0 in the third, which Edgardo
Alfonzo fueled with a lead-off double. John Olerud then dumped an
opposite-field single into left to bring in Alfonzo. Two batters
later with runners on first and third, Robin Ventura beat out a
potential double-play ball with the aid of an Andy Fox throwing
error, bringing Olerud in from third for the third run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' first response to missing Piazza was this: Benny
Agbayani, hitting fourth in Piazza's place. walked to lead off the
second. Two hitters later, Pratt, starting at Piazza's catcher's
spot, milked a walk after being down 1-2 in the count to keep the
inning alive. Then No. 8 hitter Rey Ordonez recorded his second RBI
of the LDS sent a grounder through shortstop for a 1-0 New York
lead.

RANGERS' TOP LINE FINDS ITS OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To Ranger fans, it was starting to seem like an
eternity. To Theo Fleury it was just a three-game drought.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury, the Rangers' new 5-foot-6-inch sparkplug, who scored 40
goals last season for Calgary and Colorado, was confident he would
score more this season. Plenty more.
</P>
<P>
   But through his first three games as a Ranger, he did not have
even a point. On Friday night Fleury scored his first goal and set
up two others, and the Rangers blew past the Carolina Hurricanes,
3-1, at Madison Square Garden for their first victory of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury scored the Rangers' final goal at 10 minutes 43 seconds
of the final period; Petr Nedved (three assists) and Adam Graves
(one goal, one assist) combined for eight points, as the Rangers
outshot the Hurricanes, 37-17. Goaltender Kirk McLean, playing for
the injured Mike Richter (back), turned in his second consecutive
solid performance.
</P>
<P>
   But the more encouraging news was the emergence of the Rangers'
top line. That news was tempered, however, by an apparent right
heel injury to Nedved, who was hit by a Mathieu Schneider slap shot
with just over eight minutes remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved skated off, and then attempted to skate during the next
two breaks in action. Finally, Nedved retreated to the Rangers'
dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are already without Richter (who has a slightly
protruding disc), left wing Valery Kamensky (stress fracture, right
forearm) and Tim Taylor (concussion). Their offense is fragile, and
without Nedved, it might become punchless, even with Fleury, who
chopped a loose puck over Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe for a 3-0
lead Friday night, out on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes' style is that of a counterpuncher, but they
never punched back Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina _ which was playing without left wing Gary Roberts, who
has a left shoulder strain, and without unsigned center Keith
Primeau _ opened in its trademark defensive shell. The trap is
intended to lull an opponent and produce a mistake. It had worked
for the Hurricanes, who came into the Garden 2-0-0 after shutting
out the Philadelphia Flyers, 2-0, on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers, who came in without a victory, played like the
much hungrier team.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes did not record their first shot on goal against
McLean until 5 1-2 minutes had been played. By the end of the first
period, the Rangers had 18 shots to Carolina's four. Halfway
through that period, the Rangers' top line of Fleury, Nedved and
Graves became a strong unit on each shift.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury, Nedved and Graves had not recorded a point through the
Rangers' first three games. The drought ended 17 minutes 28 seconds
into the first period, when Fleury and Nedved set up defenseman
Stephane Quintal for the game's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   The play started in the Rangers' zone. After a long battle for
the puck along the boards, Quintal flipped the puck over Carolina's
Jeff O'Neill to trigger a Rangers' rush. Fleury and Nedved moved
through the neutral zone, creating a 4-on-3 situation. Moving along
the left-wing boards, Fleury carried the puck into the offensive
zone as Nedved hustled down right wing to set up a screen. Fleury
caught Quintal, who was the trailer along the right wing, and hit
him with a pass through the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Quintal sent a wrist shot from the right faceoff circle over
Irbe's right shoulder. The goalie, who was screened by Nedved,
never saw the puck until it was in the net. Quintal had his first
goal as a Ranger, Nedved his first point of the season and Fleury
his first point as a member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers had a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was more of the same. Even the Rangers'
dormant power play contributed something, with Fleury acting as the
catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   With Marek Malik in the penalty box serving a double-minor for a
high stick that caught John MacLean in the face, the
Fleury-Nedved-Graves line clicked less than a minute into the
penalty. Nedved carried the puck through the neutral zone before
hitting Fleury on right wing at the blue line. Fleury skated down
the wing and fired a pass through the right circle for Graves, who
was cruising down the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Graves knocked a modified one-timer _ it was more of a shovel
motion than a swing _ past a helpless Irbe at 13:36 of the second
period for his first goal of the season. Fleury and Nedved each had
their second assist. The Rangers had scored more than one goal for
the first time this season. They outshot the overmatched Hurricanes
by 31-10 over the first two periods.

SPREWELL LANDS IN NEW YORK AS KNICKS ISSUE A FINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ On the same day the New York Knicks took
disciplinary action against Latrell Sprewell for his mysterious and
unexplained absence from training camp, the unpredictable guard
surfaced in the New York area Friday afternoon when he checked into
the same hotel he lived in last season.
</P>
<P>
   He had apparently spent the previous three days on the road,
driving from Oakland, Calif., to his hometown, Milwaukee, and on to
Westchester County, N.Y., according to two people close to Sprewell
with knowledge of his travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   If so, this partly explains why the Knicks had been unable to
reach him this week. On Friday they began to fine Sprewell for each
of his unexcused absences from practice.
</P>
<P>
   After almost 48 hours of no word from anyone associated with the
player, the two people close to Sprewell said that his agent,
Robert Gist, called late Friday. But as of Friday night, it was
unclear whether Sprewell would attend the final day of camp on
Saturday. The Knicks return home after a workout here in the
morning and resume training on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, the Knicks' tolerance for Sprewell's behavior
was continuing to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you have to take disciplinary action,'' general
manager Scott Layden said. ``And so I'm just going to leave it at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, Sprewell was excused from practice to be
in court for a civil lawsuit that had been filed against him in
California. After the jury awarded the plaintiffs $105,000 on
Tuesday _ an amount far short of the $3.5 million they had
reportedly been seeking _ Sprewell's agent told Layden on Wednesday
afternoon that his client was on his way to Milwaukee but would be
in camp by Wednesday night or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As day five of camp passed on Friday, Sprewell was still a
no-show. If the Knicks decide to fine Sprewell from Wednesday on,
his wallet could be as much as $25,000 lighter, according to league
rules. Last April, when the Madison Square Garden president, Dave
Checketts, fined Sprewell $25,000 for the critical remarks of his
agent, the apparel company that Sprewell endorses, And 1, picked up
the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Sprewell's reason for failing to communicate with the
Knicks this week, it is doubtful it will appease a team that grew
weary of the distraction his disappearance caused. But, as coach
Jeff Van Gundy pointed out, pro athletes are not your average
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few employees, except on Wall Street and in professional
sports, make more money than the people they supposedly work for,''
Van Gundy said. ``I'm just saying we can't apply real-world logic
to the NBA. I'm not going to get into a war of words. Discipline is
important. He's important to our team. Disciplinary actions are
obviously going to take place. What I want to do more than anything
is to get it resolved so we can get on with the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks would like to get on with the sleek style of play
Sprewell was such a big part of last season. But in his absence,
the team has been unable to experiment with Sprewell and Allan
Houston in a big backcourt. The team also has not had a chance to
get in the same comfort zone it had as it made its run to the
finals last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing much different than last year,'' said Van
Gundy, whose team's first exhibition game is Tuesday. ``But in
preparation for the season, we have to start strong. Our guys have
to be focused on the first 13 games where 10 of them are on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are already going to be undermanned without Patrick
Ewing and, potentially, Chris Dudley. Ewing has said he will not
play until the tendinitis in his Achilles' tendon has eased, and
Dudley cannot run, because of a knee he sprained this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really thinking in terms of lineups,'' Van Gundy said.
``I'm just thinking about how to put our team together so we can
play well right off the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell is an integral part of that plan. But his disappearance
this week has left the team in a bad position. He was always a bit
eccentric in his ways, but Sprewell's recent behavior has left some
question about whether the team wants to invest up to $70 million
in him with a contract extension. Throughout this week, his
commitment to the organization has been suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline is an important part of any team,'' Van Gundy said.
``It's really an important part of this team. This is not about
making an example of anyone. But you do the right thing. You do
what you're supposed to do.''

GIULIANI QUIETLY BUILDS AN APPARATUS FOR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For months, Rudolph Giuliani has said that the best
way to run for U.S. Senate is to be a good mayor, without
distractions from a campaign apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks since Labor Day, Giuliani's unannounced race
against Hillary Rodham Clinton has entered a new stage, as City
Hall and the mayor's closest aides quietly build the foundation of
an aggressive, very Republican campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Powers, the friend of four decades who ran Giuliani's
three campaigns for mayor, is once again playing the central role
as Giuliani's chief political adviser. Other key figures, many of
them veterans of the mayor's campaigns, have already begun the
political trench work, from filming footage for future commercials
to sizing up Mrs. Clinton's stump style.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani's Senate exploratory committee is
continuing to raise the $15 million to $20 million he needs for the
race, although as his expected Senate announcement date of early
2000 draws closer, several aides have privately expressed concern
about the pace of his fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't realize the juggernaut that's about to hit him,''
said one adviser, referring to the first lady's all-but-certain
Senate campaign. ``This is not Ruth Messinger. This is not David
Dinkins.'' Giuliani trounced Messinger in the 1997 mayoral race and
defeated Dinkins, the incumbent, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   This adviser, like nearly everyone interviewed for this article,
requested anonymity, because the mayor has told his aides not to
talk about the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser complained that it was like ``pulling teeth'' to get
the mayor to attend fund-raisers outside the city, and that it was
impossible to raise $20 million in the city alone. But aides still
say they are confident that Giuliani can raise $7 million by the
end of the year. They also say, in part with the defensive
intention of lowering expectations, that they know that Mrs.
Clinton will raise as much as $25 million in all, and $10 million
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Giuliani _ who endorsed Gov. Mario Cuomo, the soul of
the liberal establishment, for re-election in 1994, and then barely
endorsed Bob Dole for president in 1996 _ has begun to cloak
himself in what aides are suddenly calling his ``core philosophy''
of Republicanism as he seeks his party's votes in the suburbs and
upstate. In past years, Giuliani has allied himself not only with
Cuomo but also the Liberal Party to win in an overwhelmingly
Democratic city.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
in Simi Valley, Calif., Giuliani called the man he served as
associate attorney general ``a force for good in the world,'' and
concluded, ``Let us be thankful that he was born, and that the
human family can reap the countless benefits that his life has
brought us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani still needs Democratic votes to win in a
Democratic state, his aides point out that Reagan carried New York
in 1980 and 1984, and that Giuliani still embraces typically
Democratic issues like gun control and choice in abortion. ``He's
running as a George Pataki Republican,'' an adviser said. ``That's
a pretty smart thing to do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor and the Republican governor have feuded for years, but
the two recently reached a truce. The public end to their quarrel
seems to be driven, at least on Giuliani's part, by his need to
have the governor on his side in the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This week the new alliance was on extravagant display, as
Giuliani and Pataki nearly fell over each other with praise during
a three-day presidential campaign trip to New York by Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani eagerly took Bush on a tour of the city
he says he has revived, and he used the opportunity to cite his
welfare-to-work program as an example of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' Bush's credo.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official position at City Hall is that there is no
campaign yet, Giuliani's political ambitions spill over into nearly
every aspect of city government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing we do here that doesn't have a political
impact,'' said Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations,
who runs the city while Giuliani is away on political trips.
</P>
<P>
   Lhota, like all other advisers at City Hall, said Giuliani's
fierce assault on the Brooklyn Museum of Art for an exhibition that
the mayor has declared offensive and anti-Catholic was not
politically motivated, but came from his true beliefs. But several
advisers nonetheless said they thought that Giuliani's position
could help him with upstate voters who are distrustful of what they
consider the sinful city.
</P>
<P>
   Other aides, while insisting that the campaign has not yet
begun, are thinking ahead in strategic detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the challenge is to identify where outside
the city you're going to get out the vote,'' one adviser said this
week. ``We lost in 1989 because we didn't get out the vote. So who
out there in the Republican Party really brings his county out? Who
talks about getting his county out, and then doesn't do it? Where
do you have to fill in with your own people?''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, there are no campaign meetings at City Hall, not
least because city laws prohibit Giuliani's senior appointed
officials from raising money and also restrict their political
activity on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say the election does not come up at the mayor's 8 a.m.
staff meeting, or at a much smaller 9 a.m. meeting in the mayor's
office. But Giuliani's inner circle regularly gets together with
cigars late in the evening on the porch of Gracie Mansion,
overlooking the East River, and discusses the campaign there, or in
the mansion's library when the weather is bad.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the key roles are already taking shape. Randy Levine,
the deputy mayor for economic development, is in charge of the
mayor's relationships with upstate and national Republicans. Adam
Goodman, Giuliani's media strategist in the 1997 mayoral campaign,
is in far more frequent contact with the mayor, and oversaw the
filming, for future campaign commercials, of a speech Giuliani gave
last week at the Reagan Presidential Library.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's former partner, Rick Wilson, has replaced Cristyne
Lategano, the mayor's former director of communications, as City
Hall liaison to the campaign.

ALIOTTI TRIES TO DOWNPLAY RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Oregon defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti isn't
sure what he'll feel when he enters the Rose Bowl this evening to
face his former team, but pain and anger are good bets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kept my feelings at bay,'' Aliotti said. ``They probably
still haven't gone away, how I feel about the situation. With time,
I'm sure they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti was UCLA's maligned defensive coordinator last season _
the man who oversaw the nation's 99th-ranked defense, the man
criticized publicly by Bruins coach Bob Toledo, the man UCLA fans
blame for the collapse at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo eventually asked Aliotti to return for the 1999 season,
although he wanted Aliotti to simplify his intricate system and
tweak it to UCLA's personnel. Despite Toledo's offer, Aliotti
sensed his support and credibility had disappeared. When the Oregon
job opened _ Aliotti and Ducks head coach Mike Bellotti are close
friends _ he bolted.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Toledo is damaged, perhaps beyond repair.
Both men have downplayed tonight's meeting, saying it's a game
between Oregon and UCLA, not Toledo and Aliotti, not a former boss
and his embarrassed assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Believing what they say is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be frank about this,'' Toledo said. ``Nick Aliotti was
not fired from this staff. He left on his own accord. That's all
I'll say about it this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliotti claims he has prepared for UCLA as he prepared for USC.
That, too, seems to contradict the laws of human emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't used, haven't said anything about me being at
UCLA,'' Aliotti said. ``I'm sure the players know it, but I haven't
approached it any differently. It's been a matter-of-fact week.''
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing than the Aliotti-Toledo matchup is Aliotti
against UCLA offensive coordinator Al Borges: They are second
cousins and close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't given this much thought,'' Borges said. ``I'm
trying to get in his head, just like I try to do with every guy.
But I feel bad it didn't work out for him here, both for him and
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges grew up in Salinas, Aliotti in Pittsburg. They were
childhood acquaintances but did not become close until adulthood.
(They missed each other as Oregon assistants by one season.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really Al against me,'' Aliotti said. ``It's the
Oregon defense against the Bruin offense, but I think I could beat
Al in a footrace.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the coaching triangle affect tonight's game? Aliotti
knows UCLA's offense and its personnel, but he won't know the
called play. UCLA knows Aliotti's coaching technique but not the
Ducks' system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense is not what (Aliotti) ran here,'' said Toledo,
who was Oregon's offensive coordinator from 1983-88. ``But he knows
our personnel.''

CONE'S FUTURE AS A YANKEE IS UNCLEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-YANKEES) 
(mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ David Cone ponders the future of his baseball
career, knows there is the sort of lingering uncertainty that he
had hoped to finally shed after signing with the Yankees, and grows
exasperated. Cone knows that he could be pitching for the Yankees
for the last time, knows it so well that he brought up the
possibility Friday and then rambled on about it for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was a mixture of anger and angst and confusion and
comprehension in Cone's voice as he talked about his failure to
deal with the likelihood that he will not return to the Yankees
next season. While general manager Brian Cashman stressed that the
Yankees had not made any decisions for 2000, Cone has heard enough
speculation about his precarious future that he spoke like a player
who feels he may be done in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, more than ever, I realize this is a unique opportunity,
it may be the last one,'' Cone said. ``I've said before that it
might be my last chance to pitch in the playoffs. ... This year, I
think I can honestly say that this may be my last chance to pitch
in the playoffs with the Yankees. Now, more than ever, I realize
that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cone sat near the entrance to the visitors' clubhouse at the
Ballpark in Arlington, he was still trying to understand everything
he was uttering. He signed a one-year, $8 million contract last
November, forgoing the opportunities for a multiyear deal with
another team, and has long professed a strong desire to finish his
career with the Yankees. Friday, Cone retracted his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that I was pretty idealistic in making those
statements,'' said Cone, who will start Game 4 of the division
series on Sunday night, if there is one. ``Now I'm much more
realistic and understand anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have budgetary concerns involving Derek Jeter,
Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada, all of whom are
guaranteed to receive raises next year, and with Paul O'Neill's
$6.5 million option likely to be exercised. They would also like to
inject Ed Yarnall, a promising and inexpensive left-hander, into
the rotation. These are some of the reasons Cone, who would
obviously want a raise, too, feels expendable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about whether I feel like I still fit in and whether it's
still a good fit and whether the organization feels like they might
be able to plug my spot with someone else,'' Cone said. ``There are
a lot of variables involved.''
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking to hear Cone, the player who is more influential
than anyone else in the clubhouse, wonder if he still fits in with
the Yankees. Cone was told that the remarks made it seem apparent
that an official in the organization had said something to him
about the direction the Yankees were headed in 2000. When Cone was
asked if this was true, he paused, looked at the carpet and said:
``Um, I'd rather not get into that. I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman seemed surprised and disappointed that Cone did not
express these concerns to him and vowed to meet with the pitcher to
remind him how critical he is to the Yankees. The general manager
said he had given Cone no insight about the muddled future, but
almost all of team's decisions emanate from Tampa, Fla., anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to know where you're going to be working and
what you're doing,'' Cashman said. ``Since he's been so superhuman,
maybe we've been a little guilty of taking him for granted and not
realizing that he needs to be told how we feel about him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cone tossed his perfect game against the Montreal Expos on
July 18, he was 10-4 with a 2.65 earned run average and said that
he was ``the best pitcher in the league this side of Pedro''
Martinez. Cone wondered how far he could have plummeted since then
and blamed himself for allowing his emotions to influence his
performances. He went 2-5 with a 4.28 ERA after the perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Cone earned his reputation as a mercenary who bounced from team
to team, but now it seemed as if he was trying to say that he
wanted to remain with the Yankees and did not want to start over
with another team.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees do not re-sign Cone, the Mets and the Orioles are
two teams that would be interested in the 36-year-old. Cone has
indicated to friends that he would seriously consider returning to
the other New York team, meaning that he might finish his career
with the Mets instead of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule it out,'' Cone said. ``At this point, I have
to put all these issues to the off-season. I got to try and just
put them away.''

 &HT;    Two banks, not one, will handle $20 billion school fund
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The State Board of Education's decision to hire
two banks instead of one to manage the $20 billion Permanent School
Fund could cost taxpayers $1.2 million in interest, according to a
Texas Education Agency analysis.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the 15-member board _ ignoring the advice of
financial experts who some members argue should be relied on more _
voted in May and July to hire two banks to oversee the funds
instead of a single bank recommended by the TEA financial staff.
</P>
<P>
   While the $1.2 million in potential earnings is tiny when
compared with the $700 million that the fund generates annually,
the action suggests another misstep by the board and its governance
of the school fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly adds to the concern that the board continues to
shoot itself in the foot,'' said Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount
Pleasant, chairman of the budget-writing Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff is among lawmakers who are considering replacing the
elected board with an appointed one, in part because of recent
decisions the board has made regarding the school fund. Ratliff
promised that his committee will pay special attention to the
Permanent School Fund in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   State Street Bank of Boston was hired to be the custodian of the
$20 billion Permanent School Fund and Citibank was hired as the
securities lender for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   A custodian is responsible for overseeing a fund's assets while
a securities lender oversees loans by one broker to another.
Typically, banks or financial institutions discount their fees when
they are hired as both the custodian and securities lender.
</P>
<P>
   Bundling those services in the bank recommended by the TEA staff
_ Northern Trust _ would have generated $5.5 million for the school
trust fund after the bank deducted its handling fees, records show.
That is $1.2 million more than what the TEA staff projected the
fund would earn by splitting services between Citibank and State
Street, or about $4.3 million after fees.
</P>
<P>
   State Street was chosen by the board because it offered a bigger
discount than Northern Trust in its bid to be custodian, TEA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank was ranked last by the TEA financial staff among the
four financial institutions that bid for the combined custodial and
securities lending business; Northern Trust Company of Chicago was
ranked first, records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we are paying a lot more,'' said Will Davis, a
Democratic board member from Austin who opposed hiring separate
banks and who has been a dissenting voice on recent board decisions
regarding the massive school fund. ``That's because we have two
firms performing duties instead of one firm performing duties.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Board Member Richard Watson, a Republican from Gorman,
voted against Northern Trust because he said he was not convinced
that Northern's bid was more beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not necessarily convinced Northern Trust would have ended
up providing more money to the fund,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The board's action follows several controversial decisions it
has made in recent months regarding the school trust fund,
including hiring a financial consultant who was fighting fraud
charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A federal
judge later cleared Russell W. Stein, senior vice president for
Everen Securities' Houston office, of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Attorney General John Cornyn said he still is
reviewing a request by State Board of Education Chairman Chase
Untermeyer to investigate the board's hiring of a dozen private
investment firms, which manage about $7 billion of the school
fund's investments.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members say that six of the firms have misdirected
the public's money into unauthorized accounts or tried to win
contracts via gifts to board members or staff.
</P>
<P>
   A review of the May and July board meeting minutes shows that
two key members, Republicans Bob Offutt and David Bradley,
persuaded their colleagues to split services rather than combining
services at one, as the TEA financial staff recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Offutt _ a San Antonio dentist _ chairs the board's finance
committee, which makes recommendations about the Permanent School
Fund. Bradley, a Beaumont insurance agent, is vice chairman of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Offutt and Bradley were unavailable for comment Friday. But
board minutes and other documents show that the decision to reject
Northern Trust was based in part on information provided by
Austinite Brian Borowski, an informal adviser to Offutt and Bradley
who has financial management experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Borowski) was invited by some of my colleagues to counter
the mathematical analysis of the (TEA) staff, and that persuaded a
majority to go with Citibank,'' Untermeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the TEA staff analysis, Northern Trust was the
second-lowest bidder for the combined custodial and lending
securities services. But the staff preferred it over the lowest
bidder, Citibank, because Northern's technology and accounting
services were deemed superior to Citibank's.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Untermeyer said the TEA financial staff was
dissatisfied with the level of service Citibank supplied as the
custodian bank to the school trust fund. Citibank, with a large
corporate division in San Antonio, has been both the custodian and
the securities lender for the school trust fund since 1995. The TEA
staff was satisfied with Citibank's performance in securities
lending.

 &HT;    Players did not invest with Stearns, attorney says

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Los Angeles attorney who invested $5.5 million
with Austin, Texas resident Brian Russell Stearns disputes federal
authorities' claims that the money may have come from NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a DFJ investment and no NFL players were
involved,'' Robert ``Bobby'' Caron, an attorney and one-time player
agent now working with DFJ Italia, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Caron said the money he wired to Stearns' bank account last May
belonged to him and a small group of private investors, including
DFJ Italia Chief Financial Officer Robert Winter.
</P>
<P>
   DFJ Italia, in Irvine, Calif., specializes in making financial
investments for professional athletes and produces movies for cable
television stations, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Stearns promised the investors a substantial payoff in a short
amount of time, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He explained to us a bond deal he had and how we could make
100 percent of our money in 30 days,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents arrested Stearns at his
$2.2 million Lake Austin home last month and charged him with
defrauding a Georgia investor of $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorney, Laird Palmer of Mason, Stearns has denied
any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In his sworn affidavit used to obtain the search warrant for
Stearns' home, IRS agent James Neff accused Stearns of operating a
scheme in which Stearns would use money from one investor to pay
other investors, creating the impression he was successfully
investing their money in secret bond markets. As collateral for the
investments, Stearns created fraudulent bonds and bank documents
indicating he had access to millions of dollars, the document
states.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Stearns defrauded investors of more than $31 million
from March 1998 through last July and spent their money on his
home, a pair of jet airplanes, a helicopter and other expensive
items, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   In his sworn statement, Neff wrote that he ``could not find any
instances where Stearns invested the money he received from
investors into the type of securities and/or bonds that he
guaranteed the investors. Stearns did use the money to purchase
substantial personal assets. . . . In many instances, as soon as
Stearns deposited investor funds into his checking account, he
would expend the funds on personal items.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff added that he had not determined where the $5.5 million
Caron sent Stearns came from, but stated that he ``believes that
the source of the money is coming from NFL players.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began looking into Caron and DFJ Italia's business
dealings when Lawrence Sweeney, an NFL senior investigator, told
them several current and former members of the Arizona Cardinals
and Cleveland Browns had put money into a DFJ Italia investment
that guaranteed a 24 percent monthly return, the federal document
states. Players who invested with DFJ Italia include Browns
offensive lineman Lomas Brown, Cardinals defensive tackle Eric
Swann, tight end Johnny McWilliams and Larry Centers, a running
back now playing with the Washington Redskins, according to the
document.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cardinals players who considered investing with DFJ Italia
were receiver Chad Carpenter and retired offensive lineman Duval
Love, the document states. Love now works for DFJ Italia soliciting
players to invest with the company, Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said he met Stearns last May and was immediately
impressed with the 29-year-old's extravagant jet-setting lifestyle
after spotting him in a Sunset Strip nightclub with Hollywood stars
Henry Winkler and Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. Winter said he also
spotted Stearns at Hugh Hefner's Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in New York earlier this week indicted
Stearns on a charge that he conspired to commit wire fraud to
obtain $26 million from a pair of foreign investors. In 1994,
Stearns pleaded guilty to grand theft by stealing about $20,000
from members of his Maryland National Guard unit and was placed on
five years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities additionally are looking into the
possibility that Stearns may have defrauded more than 100 residents
of the Hill Country town of Brady of as much as $5 million in his
alleged investment scheme.

QUIETLY AND CONSISTENTLY, BAINES JUST KEEPS HITTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are plenty of guys in major-league uniforms who
are older than Harold Baines, but most are coaches and managers.
Only 10 players are older than Baines, and only three are still
around for the postseason. And few players of any age are hitting
the baseball any better than Baines in this first round of the
playoffs. Life might not begin at 40, but Baines' career is
continuing at that age at a remarkably consistent pace.
</P>
<P>
   In seven at-bats in two games as designated hitter for the
Cleveland Indians, Baines has three hits, one of them a home run.
He helped the Indians win both games, and they can clinch their
best-of-5 division series over the Boston Red Sox when they meet on
Saturday in Fenway Park. Should the Sox extend the series, game
four would be here on Sunday and game five would be in Cleveland on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get, the more you appreciate all the hard work
that it takes to get to the playoffs,'' said Baines, who was
acquired in a trade with Baltimore on Aug. 27. ``In my case, I'm
coming over from a team that struggled most of the year, so I'm
very happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning of game two on Thursday at Jacobs Field,
Baines hit Bret Saberhagen's first pitch for a three-run home run
to increase Cleveland's lead to 6-1, the decisive moment of the
game. Saberhagen said it was a good pitch, a fastball low and away.
Baines, called a professional hitter by teammates and rivals, said
he was looking for a pitch in that zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, you just learn certain situations what type of
pitch you think you're going to get,'' Baines said. ``That means
you are going to get it 80 percent of the time. I'm a zone
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hart, the Indians' general manager, knew how Baines hit
when he got him for two minor-league pitchers. He is approaching
milestones of 400 home runs and 3,000 hits. But Hart said he was
also attracted by Baines' subtle and intangible qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be in a situation where you need a big hit,'' Hart
said. ``Some guys like it, some guys don't. This guy wants it. You
know the other team doesn't want to have to pitch to him in a tight
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an opinion shared by Sandy Alomar, the Cleveland catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I saw him come to the plate, I go, `Oh, man, here
comes this dude again,''' Alomar said. ``He's so hard to get out.
He's a very, very, very good hitter. When you have a Harold Baines
on your team, you feel a sense of relaxation.''
</P>
<P>
   A left-handed batter, Baines hit .312 in the regular season with
25 home runs and 103 RBIs, close to career bests in each category.
His greater value may come in the next round, if the Indians and
Yankees advance to play for the pennant. Yankee Stadium's
right-field fence is an inviting target for left-handed batters
with power.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Baines has batted .386 in
his career against David Cone and .317 against Roger Clemens.
Against Yankees pitching over two decades, Baines has a .286
average with 27 home runs and 119 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Yankees were a factor in his transfer to Cleveland,
Baines said, ``I think that is a great part of the reason I am
here.'' And Hart fought back a smile as he said the Yankees were in
the ``back of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates and managers speak of how Baines' personality affects
the mood in a clubhouse. Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said
Baines ``brings a unique professionalism to our ball club'' because
he carries himself the same way when things are going good or bad.
``He is always on an even keel,'' Hargrove said. ``I don't want to
say mild mannered, but very consistent. Our younger players see
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar, the 33-year-old catcher, said Baines is ``not a rah-rah
guy'' but one who ``speaks the truth'' and is willing to share his
wisdom when asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome, the 29-year-old first baseman who has two home runs
this series, said Baines' ``bat does a lot more talking than he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His approach to the game is great,'' Thome said. ``He's a guy
that really never shows much emotion. And when he hit that home
run, I saw the smile on his face when he crossed home plate and
that was great. That was awesome.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daniel Griffiths, a former dean of the New York
University School of Education who changed its approach from
anecdotal teaching to the use of modern research methods, died Oct.
2. He was 82 and lived in Scarsdale.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a heart attack on the golf course at the Scarsdale
Golf Club and was pronounced dead at White Plains Hospital, said
John Beckman, a spokesman for NYU.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths, who presented his ideas in his book ``Administrative
Theory'' (Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1959), drew upon techniques
developed in the social sciences, and the innovation was widely
copied.
</P>
<P>
   Born on May 8, 1917, in Bridgeport, Conn., he received a
bachelor of education from Central Connecticut State College in
1940. He got a master's degree from the University of New Hampshire
in 1949 and a doctorate from Yale in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, he served in the Army Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he taught high school mathematics, and then
taught at Teachers College of Columbia University. In 1961, he
moved to NYU as associate dean of the School of Education. He
became dean in 1965 and retired in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths is survived by his wife, Priscilla Tomlinson of
Scarsdale; a daughter, Priscilla Russel of Princeton, N.J.; a son,
Michael Griffiths of Tampa, Fla., and three grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A VICTORY FOR PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   The House's passage of a comprehensive patients' rights bill
this week could go a long way toward easing public concerns about
managed-care plans. Unlike the Senate, which remains a captive of
the insurance lobby, the House has produced an impressive piece of
bipartisan legislation that will set strong national standards for
health maintenance organizations and other plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-eight Republicans defied their leadership to vote for the
Norwood-Dingell bill, which has overwhelming support from groups
representing doctors, nurses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Republicans, including Charlie Norwood, prime
author of the bill, arrived in Congress as ``Contract With
America'' supporters, dedicated to smaller government. They are not
allies of trial lawyers or fans of government regulation. But they
clearly heard from constituents who feel powerless against HMO
abuses and want the right to hold plans accountable for wrongful
denials of care.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance lobby has begun its media blitz by engaging in a
round of lawyer-bashing. But that tactic is not likely to persuade
the public that the managed-care industry alone should retain
immunity from lawsuits for the deaths and injuries caused by
improper decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the House bill insist that opening up health plans
to lawsuits will send costs soaring. But patients cannot get
punitive damages under the bill _ the big worry for health plans _
unless a plan refuses to comply with the recommendations of an
independent review panel. Research on liability costs, including
that produced by the Congressional Budget Office, shows that
expanding the right to sue would increase premiums only modestly.
</P>
<P>
   The fight now moves to the House-Senate conference committee
that must reconcile the Norwood-Dingell bill with a vastly weaker
Senate bill that passed in July. The Senate bill contains no new
right to sue, and most of its provisions would apply to only 48
million people rather than the 161 million covered in the House
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the upcoming battle is an ill-considered
package of health-related tax breaks that the House attached to the
patients' rights bill. The package, expected to cost more than $40
billion over 10 years, is strongly opposed by the Democrats and
President Clinton. That problem will have to be solved before any
legislation is signed. But for patients to get real protection, the
Senate cannot be allowed to water down the hard-fought provisions
of the historic House bill.

EDITORIAL: GAY RIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   California sets an admirable example for the nation by moving
ahead with legislation that will help deter discrimination against
gays in public and private life. Although California earlier
enacted hate-crime laws to protect gays and lesbians from violence,
the three bills signed into law by Gov. Gray Davis last week will
help ensure that gays receive fair and equal treatment at work, in
housing and at school. The movement in California, the nation's
largest state, to normalize government treatment of gays is an
important step toward ending anti-gay bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new laws, California will create a statewide registry
for domestic partners, defined as same-sex couples and unmarried
couples age 62 or older, when marriage may in certain cases reduce
limited retirement benefits. Domestic partners will be able to get
hospital visitation rights, as family members do now, and those who
are state employees will be eligible to receive health insurance
benefits for their partners. Many cities in California, including
Los Angeles, already provide health benefits for domestic partners
under local laws. This state statute will make it easier for local
governments to offer such benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A second measure would outlaw harassment of gays in public
schools and colleges. Violence and threats against students based
on their sexual orientation are a clear danger, but many school
officials have failed to take such harassment seriously or have not
known how to respond. The new California law, following similar
laws enacted in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Connecticut, now
prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. It will make
school administrations accountable for combating anti-gay
harassment. Another measure strengthens older state laws that ban
discrimination against gays in housing and employment.
</P>
<P>
   These new laws do nothing more than provide gays the basic
rights that heterosexuals have without question. Still, they are an
important advancement in ending discrimination as a matter of
public policy.

CORPORATE NAMES ARE THE REALM OF THE ACQUIRER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Bernard J. Ebbers, William T. Esrey and
top lieutenants from MCI WorldCom and Sprint Corp. sat down to
hammer out what to call their soon-to-be merged companies, it was a
brief debate.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers, chief executive of MCI WorldCom, and Esrey, chief
executive of Sprint, decided the new name would be WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of corporate branding experts from around the United
States mostly lamented the choice, including Ira Bachrach, who
tagged the new moniker pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want it to mean the world of communications or worldwide
communications,'' said Bachrach, president of San Francisco-based
NameLab Inc. ``But it's just a dumb word that doesn't mean anything
_ it's just a name, like Fred.''
</P>
<P>
   What Ebbers and his team should have done, according to Bachrach
and other branding experts, was set aside their egos and call the
new company Sprint. That name has energy, vitality, speed, even
humanness.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be unprecedented for the conqueror to take on the
conquered's name. Earlier this year, for example, NationsBank
completed its purchase of Bank of America and then retained the
better-known Bank of America name.
</P>
<P>
   Besides settling on a corporate name, merging companies have a
myriad of other marketing decisions to make, including which
products to market under which names.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sprint's product line uses the Sprint name, such as
Sprint PCS and its local and long-distance services. MCI,
meanwhile, markets products both under its name and others that
don't mention MCI, such as its 10-10-321 dial-around service.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing experts called Sprint one of the strongest and most
distinctive brand names in the telecommunications industry, an
industry populated with ``techs,'' ``teles'' and ``coms.''
</P>
<P>
   A study in the summer by International Data Corp., based in
Framingham, Mass., showed Sprint the second most-recognized name in
the telecommunications industry, behind only powerhouse brand AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   That same survey found that MCI, the one-time No. 2 brand name
in the industry, had dropped to 11th after it was attached to
WorldCom. WorldCom bought MCI last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, said Tim Kiersted, senior analyst for
International Data who is based in Austin, Texas, WorldCom vaulted
from 33rd most-recognized to 11th once it married MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Kiersted said it was likely the Sprint and the MCI product
brands would drop in rankings once they were no longer attached to
their current corporate names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I have to wonder how they're going to build in and
blend their portfolio of names under this scenario,'' Kiersted
said. ``The question is do they try to continue to build them as
separate but strong brand names?''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the issues Sprint and WorldCom will talk about once
the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission
and other regulators bless their union, said Tom Weigman, Sprint's
senior vice president, consumer market strategy and communications.
Completing the merger could take a year to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, the two have struck several agreements,
including one in which MCI WorldCom has the rights to sell Sprint
PCS service under the WorldCom name.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Weigman is sure of, based on comments from Esrey and
Ebbers, is that the Sprint and MCI names will live on in some form.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have both stated their intent to use all the brand
names,'' Weigman said. ``What we're thinking about now is how we
might want to approach those issues....We have a number of thoughts
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weigman was hesitant to talk about marketing plans, because the
two companies must wait for regulatory approval before discussing
these issues together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually anything is conceivable,'' Weigman said.
``Accelerating growth and what makes compelling strategic sense at
that point is what will drive the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom marketing executives could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have several models to follow as it works
through those issues, said Steve Rivkin, a corporate branding
expert based in Glen Rock, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   There's the GE model, in which most every part of the company,
from $2 light bulbs to $2 million jet engines, are GE-branded.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Procter &AMP; Gamble model, which has thousands of
products, none of which is called Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   In between there's the 3M approach, where some products such as
transparent tape have the 3M brand and others such as Post-it notes
are stand-alone products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the Sprint and MCI names should be preserved
and used as fighting brands against existing strong competition,''
Rivkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach is leery of any plan that would use a bunch of
different brand names under one corporate umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to maintain more than one identity?''
Bachrach said. ``Instead of being one very large thing, it divides
you into two smaller things in a world where arguably, the larger
you are the better the vendor you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach even theorizes that the Sprint name would have had more
clout on Wall Street and, more important, on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Rivkin also says it is sad that WorldCom executives chucked the
Sprint name from the corporate holding company. But he's not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Rivkin recalls one incident in which the company being bought
insisted its name be retained. The acquirer said if that happened,
it would lower its bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Do you want to tell your shareholders they're
getting less for their stock but their name is being preserved or
do you want the money?' '' Rivkin recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a righteous world, yes, the new company probably should
have been called Sprint,'' Rivkin said. ``But given the reality of
corporate egos, they probably didn't give it more than a
milliseconds' worth of thought. History is written by the winner _
the acquirer decides.''

HIGH DEMAND STRAINS U.S. HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reasonable people may disagree on the merits of allowing
patients to sue their health-care plans, but those who favor the
idea shouldn't be fooled as to the trade-off involved.
</P>
<P>
   If the House version of the patients' bill of rights becomes
law, health-care insurance coverage will become more expensive and
the population of uninsured Americans will continue to increase as
a result. Meantime, the quality of care will gradually deteriorate
as resources previously used to finance health care are diverted to
pay insurers' legal bills, plaintiffs' lawyers and outrageous
damages awarded by juries more interested in vengeance than
economic justice.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Americans have become convinced that
managed-care providers concentrate too much on the bottom line to
the detriment of their ailing clients. Given some of the horror
stories concerning policies designed to ration care, the anecdotal
evidence is difficult to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, only anecdotal evidence. In the main, it appears
as though the U.S. system is the world's best and the health-care
needs of the overwhelming majority of Americans are being
reasonably well-served. It can also be said with some certainty
that the system's inadequacies often are as much the fault of
government policy and user demands as they are of health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether anyone likes it or not, health care is being rationed in
America because society's choice of payment mechanism has boosted
demand beyond what the system can deliver to everyone's
satisfaction. Medicare can't pay its way, so government
shortchanges providers with ever more stingy reimbursements.
Employers find the cost of insuring work forces ever more
expensive, so they seek out the most economical means of providing
health benefits. The result in both the public and private sectors
is a form of rationing disguised as something else.
</P>
<P>
   That something else is the pretense that it's the fault of
providers when they can't reasonably respond to the needs of those
whose care is underwritten by either government or an employer. The
essential problem is that most Americans want sport-utility vehicle
coverage at compact car prices.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam is the archetypal culprit in this regard. Despite the
obvious strains on the health-care system, the federal government
has continued to pile mandate after mandate on the system. It has
done this either by expanding government-financed benefits or
passing laws forcing private enterprises to add benefits to their
health-care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And when the resulting strains overload the system, what
happens? The public demands laws to bolster patient power by
expanding access to tort relief. In some cases, an expansion of the
right to sue may be justified, but the reality is that too many
Americans have proved themselves incapable of using their tort
system responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Tort law is not so much a way to redress wrongs in America
anymore as it is a way for the greedy and unscrupulous to seek
massive financial jackpots by playing litigation lottery. If
Washington paints a bull's-eye on the back of health-care plans,
the industry soon will be more about get-rich-quick litigation
schemes than the practice of medicine.

ENGLISH MAGISTRATE SAYS PINOCHET CAN BE EXTRADITED TO SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS reaction in Chile in 5th graf)  (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A London court ruled Friday that Gen. Augusto Pinochet
of Chile can be extradited to Spain to stand trial on torture and
conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy chief magistrate of the Bow Street Magistrates Court,
Ronald Bartle, said that ``all the conditions are in place'' for
the transfer of the former Chilean dictator from London to Madrid
to face one charge of conspiracy to torture and 34 charges of the
torture of individual Chileans.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a number of dramatic court decisions since
Pinochet's arrest a year ago, Friday's was the first to be based on
the crimes he is accused of rather than simply on the legality of
his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was excused from appearing in the packed chamber
because of his failing health. But in a defiant statement read by
Clive Nicholls, his chief lawyer, he protested his innocence and
said he was the victim of a political conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, rights advocates and relatives of Pinochet-era victims
celebrated while Pinochet's allies expressed bitter disappointment,
but the country's reaction to the ruling was generally muted. There
were small competing marches around Santiago, but they were
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers have 15 days to decide whether to appeal to the High
Court, and in the likely event that they do so, the case could
continue on through many more months of legal maneuvering and end
up returning to England's highest tribunal, the Law Lords of the
House of Lords, where it has already been through two extended
judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all the appeals have been exhausted, Home Secretary
Jack Straw must make a final decision on whether Pinochet, 83,
should be sent to Spain. That decision, too, is subject to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's lawyers declined to say what their next course of
action would be, but Fernando Barros, a Chilean professor who leads
the general's support group in London, said there would be an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In getting Pinochet excused from court Friday, his British
doctor testified Wednesday that he had suffered two small strokes
in September and that he was disoriented and ``giddy'' much of the
time. The state of his health is not an issue during the appeal
process, but it will be a critically germane one if and when the
time comes to determine his fitness to go to Spain and stand trial.
One option open to Straw would be freeing Pinochet on compassionate
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)

   Bartle on Friday stressed that his ruling and the four days of
hearings held in the court in September were focused not on guilt
or innocence but only on whether the extradition papers were in
order and the charges were extraditable offenses under British law.

   ``It cannot be too strongly emphasized that these proceedings
are not conducted for the purpose of deciding the guilt or
innocence of Senator Pinochet in respect of the allegations made
against him,'' he said in his decision. `` Nor would a finding on
my part, that the request of Spain should be complied with, be any
indication whatever that I have formed a view as to his guilt or
innocence.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   Pinochet, who gave himself the title of senator for life in an
effort to grant himself immunity from prosecution, said in a
statement: ``I declare that I am not guilty of the crimes of which
I am accused.'' He continued: ``Spain has not produced a single
piece of evidence which shows that I am guilty. Not only that, I
believe that Spain has not properly investigated any of the these
crimes and Spain does not even have jurisdiction to try me.''
</P>

<P>
   He said Spain was acting ``in violation of the sovereignty of
Chile'' and that ``It has long been clear that my extradition is
politically motivated and is being pursued clearly for political
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Alun Jones, the British lawyer representing the Spanish
government, said he had nothing to say in response to the Pinochet
claims, telling the court that there were already enough ``strident
voices'' surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a rally in Pinochet's behalf at the Conservative Party
conference in Blackpool on Wednesday night, former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher argued that he had been the victim of a
``judicial kidnap'' in circumstances ``which would do credit to a
police state.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Pinochet supporter, the former Conservative Chancellor
of the Exchequer Norman Lamont, argued that the British
government's longtime contention that the arrest and detention of
Pinochet was a judicial and not a political matter had been
undermined by a comment by Prime Minister Tony Blair in which he
called the former Chilean dictator ``unspeakable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Labor party convention in Bournemouth 11
days ago excoriating the opposition Conservatives as being out of
touch, Blair called them ``the party of fox-hunting, Pinochet and
hereditary peers _ the uneatable, the unspeakable and the
unelectable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing the point Friday, Barros said Blair's scornful comment
had been an unacceptable intervention in the case. ``That makes
this null and void,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's judgment, Bartle turned aside defense lawyers'
objections to the submission of the 35 cases outlined by Baltasar
Garzon, the Spanish judge who assembled the case against Pinochet.
The original charges against Pinochet at the time of his arrest in
London last Oct. 16 included allegations of kidnapping, murder and
genocide in the disappearances of more than 3,000 people dating to
1973, the year Pinochet seized power in Chile.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A decision by the Law Lords in March drastically reduced the
number of cases and limited the relevant period to after December
1988, the date when Britain adopted the international torture
convention making torture abroad a crime punishable in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that only two of the original charges, the conspiracy
count and a single torture allegation, survived from the original
extradition request. Over the summer Garzon added 33 new cases to
the application, and in Friday's ruling Bartle approved their
inclusion. ``The further material, objected to by the defense, is
in my view supplementary to and in amplification of the conduct
alleged against Senator Pinochet, namely his involvement in acts of
torture and conspiracy to commit such acts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision also appeared to give prosecutors some leeway to
get around that strict date. They would be able to cite
disappearances of people in the 1970s on the basis that these acts
were undertaken to commit ``mental torture'' on relatives and
survivors that continued into the period after 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not this was intended by the regime of Senator
Pinochet is in my view a matter of fact for the trial court,''
Bartle said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors also gained the right to introduce evidence of
events before the crucial date as part of their effort to prove
that Pinochet was guilty of a long-running conspiracy to torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magistrate's ruling will allow the Spanish prosecutors to
show that Pinochet created a repressive state apparatus that relied
on torture, that he was fully aware that torture was being
practiced systematically and that he never once punished anyone who
committed torture,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human
Rights Watch in New York, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet has been living in a London suburb under police guard
since leaving a hospital in December where he was recuperating from
back surgery. He was arrested at the request of Garzon, who made
his case in the course of studying atrocities committed during the
so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The case has wound its way through English courts and already
secured a valuable legal victory for the human rights movement _
the finding that former heads of state do not enjoy immunity from
arrest and prosecution for crimes against humanity.

   LOS ANGELES _ A gavel crashes down as the most important people
in the Los Angeles Dodgers front office take their seats at a
blond-wood conference table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This postseason meeting of the marketing and promotions
department will please come to order. Bertleson, kindly remove the
Diamondbacks cap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a difficult year for all of us. The team
finished in third place and the organization took a few hits from
the letter writers and talk-show callers. To put it bluntly, fans
don't love the Dodgers as much as they used to. Our challenge is to
devise an advertising strategy to win them back, lest we start next
season with a bunch of empty suites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Graziano wouldn't like a bunch of empty suites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, Bertleson, you missed a memo during your recent vacation.
I'll fill you in later. Anyway, let's go around the table and share
our ideas for a 2000 advertising plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one. How about this for a slogan? `The Dodgers: We Do
Our Best for You 161 Times a Season.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is !ital!162 games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that. Now tell the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one. `The Dodgers: We Spell Fun
G-R-U-D-Z-I-E-L-A-N-E-K!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a mouthful. But I'll write it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one: `Dodgers Baseball: You'll Come for the Hot Dogs,
You'll Stay for the Beer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, anyway. Parlato, do you have any thoughts?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about: `What Else Are You Going to Watch, Our Pro Football
Team?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, people, I think we're on the wrong track here. Perhaps
we should think in more general terms about an overall approach
instead of trying to write a catchy slogan. If we come up with the
right !ital!message, the words will fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``McGrotto, what's in that box?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A few items that might suggest an approach.''
</P>
<P>
   He holds up a new gray T-shirt bearing the words, ``Chicago
Cubs, World Series Champions, 1908.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell this at Wrigley Field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very funny, McGrotto, but what does it have to do with
the Dodgers?''
</P>
<P>
   McGrotto holds up an orange-and-black lapel pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Croix de Candlestick _ these Latin words say, `I
Came, I Saw, I Survived.' The Giants used to hand them out to fans
who stayed to the end of extra-inning night games. It was their way
of poking fun at their own ballpark. Fans ate it up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was clever of the Giants. But McGrotto, we're the
Dodgers!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bear with me. Who recognizes this book?''
</P>
<P>
   He holds up an old, dog-eared paperback.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Jonathan Livingston Seagull'? '' someone guesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It's called `Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?' It's
about the 1962 Mets and it was a bestseller. People loved to read
about the foibles of a last-place ballclub. Think about all the
books written about the Red Sox _ `Curse of the Bambino,' `One Out
Away,' `One Strike Away,' `One Grounder Away,' `One Warning-Track
Fly Ball Away' . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``McGrotto, will you please get to the point?''
</P>
<P>
   He props up a black-and-white publicity mug shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, it's Lou Grant!'' someone says fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it's Joe Garagiola, and he parlayed funny stories
about a thoroughly mediocre catching career with some of history's
worst teams into popularity as a sportscaster, game-show host and
author. Anyone see what I'm getting at here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That we should sell more T-shirts, buttons and paperbacks?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly. My point is that in baseball, you don't have to
be a winner to be popular with the public. The game has a long
tradition of lovable losers. The Dodgers were lovable losers back
in Brooklyn and now people yearn for the days of `Dem Bums.' The
Cubs sell out!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're saying we should market the Dodgers as lovable
losers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll never be a better time. We could give away `Wait Till
Next Year' shirts on opening day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does McGrotto's idea strike anybody as too weird?''
</P>
<P>
   Bertleson speaks up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only problem I see is that our baseball people could mess up
our whole strategy by fielding a winning team next year.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, everybody has a good laugh and goes to lunch.
