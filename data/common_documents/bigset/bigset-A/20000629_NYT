DEPLETED OPPOSITION IN BELARUS SEARCHES FOR A NEW LEADER

<P>
   MINSK, Belarus _ For months, Ivan Misko scraped, spackled and
molded until he had properly endowed his bust of Gennady Karpenko
with the mountainous brow of a scholar, the sturdy jaw of a leader
and, above all, the forward gaze of a charismatic politician
peering into the Belarussian future.
</P>
<P>
   As a devoted friend to the late Karpenko, a physicist and
politician, Misko this spring cast his work in plaster and
supervised its transformation into bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is almost ready for unveiling at Karpenko's tomb, a
ceremony that when it takes place sometime in July will be a
significant political act in this authoritarian state that lies
between Russia and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   For Karpenko was, until his death on April 6, 1999, one of the
most dangerous men in Belarus as the leader of the opposition
forces seeking to oust President Aleksandr Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   Karpenko, a deputy speaker of the Parliament disbanded by
Lukashenko in 1996, died abruptly at age 49 of what the medical
authorities here said was a brain hemorrhage. Though there is no
proof of foul play, the circumstances surrounding Karpenko's final
hours _ he received no serious medical attention for 24 hours after
he collapsed and entered a state medical center _ have caused his
family to doubt that he died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning I suspected that he was murdered
somehow,'' said his wife, Lyudmila. ``And when other opposition
leaders started disappearing months later, it confirmed my
suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture of respect for Karpenko's advocacy of democracy,
the U.S. ambassador, Daniel Speckhard, made a private visit to the
grave site last year accompanied by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Since the funeral, the pressure on the family has not eased.
Karpenko's son, Dimitri, has been driven from his job in a state
enterprise, and his family remains under surveillance and
harassment from Lukashenko's security forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid for my children,'' Lyudmila Karpenko said. ``They
don't have a future in this country. We are going to open the
monument to Gennady, and then we are going to leave the country. It
is just too hard to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   As a state artist of the Soviet Union, Misko spent much of his
life lionizing astronauts and other heroes of socialist labor. His
studio, at the edge of a leafy courtyard near the center of the
capital, is an untidy museum of the socialist realism that
flourished under Communism, and that Stalin saw as the best means
to bend art to the service of the totalitarian state. It became
state policy in 1932, the year Misko was born.
</P>
<P>
   A barrel-chested sculptor who chiseled President Clinton's
profile on a commemorative medallion for his visit here in 1994,
Misko would be the last person to say he is engaging in politics
with his art. But the Karpenko bust is unmistakably an act of
rebellion against the authoritarianism that exists under
Lukashenko, an admirer of Stalin and the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing it for free,'' said Misko, whose shock of white
hair and mischievous eyes always seem to convey more than he says.
``I am not doing it for money _ in fact, no one wants to pay for
it. The family does not have the money, and there is no one else to
place the order, especially not the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my friend for a long time,'' Misko said of Karpenko.
</P>
<P>
   As the bronze was being cast last week, the visage of Karpenko
in clay still dominated Misko's studio, capturing what friends say
was the quiet resolve of the man who unified the country's
opposition parties little more than a year ago, and prepared them
to stage a mock presidential election that challenged Lukashenko's
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko's presidential term expired last July, though he
continues to rule after rewriting the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling of the Karpenko memorial is scheduled for sometime
after the Congress of Democratic Forces, a grouping of opposition
parties, convenes on July 2 here in the capital. Unless Lukashenko
bans it, the congress aims once again to unite all opposition
parties in a new challenge to the president.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The congress, its organizers say, will demand fair elections
this fall for a new Parliament and next year for a new president,
and it will insist that Lukashenko re-establish the rule of
parliamentary law that has been replaced in recent years by
presidential decrees.
</P>
<P>
   Were Karpenko still alive, he would certainly have been the
leading candidate to challenge Lukashenko, in the view of most
political analysts here. Without him the opposition cannot offer a
broadly acceptable leader, said Yevgeny Ogurtsov, a member of the
United Civic Party and an editor whose newspaper, The Citizen, was
shut down by Lukashenko in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Karpenko's death was deeply disturbing to many
here, and in the months that followed, Belarussians were all the
more stunned by the assault on most of the remaining opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the political landscape has been wiped clean,
says Irina Khalip, an independent journalist who has been arrested
and harassed for her coverage of corruption and political abuse
under Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``All political leaders who might have laid claim to the
presidency have either died under suspicious circumstances, like
Karpenko, or they have fled in fear of their lives or
disappeared,'' she said. ``The remaining ones have been convicted
of political crimes with conditions that they cannot participate in
the elections, and so today there is almost no opposition figure
who could run against Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless,'' Khalip added, ``it is a big mistake for
Lukashenko to feel safe, because a new leader will appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Karpenko did.

HOUSE INCUMBENT LOSES IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Texas, Va.)   (CORRECTS ``four'' to ``3 1/2'' in lede   
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Scarcely two hours after the polls closed on
Tuesday night, Rep. Merrill Cook acknowledged the inevitable. His
turbulent 3 1/2 years representing Utah's 2nd Congressional
District had caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer than half the votes counted, Cook conceded to Derek
Smith, a business owner and political newcomer who went on to win
nearly 59 percent of the vote, making Cook the first Republican
incumbent to lose in a primary this year. One incumbent Democrat
has fallen, Rep. Matthew Martinez of California's 31st District,
who lost to state Sen. Hilda Solis.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Solis, who has no opponent in November, Smith will
face a formidable challenger, Jim Matheson, a political neophyte,
as well, but also the son of an immensely popular former governor,
the late Scott Matheson. With Democrats needing a swing of six
seats to regain the House majority they lost in 1994, this is one
seat they believe they have a strong chance to win back.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah's other major Republican primary on Tuesday, Gov.
Michael Leavitt withstood a spirited challenge from the right and
defeated Glen Davis with 61 percent of the vote. Leavitt, who is
seeking a third four-year term, will face Bill Orton, a former
Democratic congressman, in the general election, a contest that
could be competitive because of the high profiles of both
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by Smith ended a seven-week campaign that turned
from nasty to nastier, reaching a climax of sorts on a Salt Lake
City street last Wednesday, when he and Cook stood for 45 minutes
arguing as reporters looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Their confrontation was a continuation of verbal assaults over
personal finances, voting habits and prospects for success in
November. Yet for Cook, it was just the latest chapter in a brief
congressional career that was never short of distractions. More
than for any notable legislation, he brought attention to himself
here and in Washington for public temper tantrums, staff turnover
and a recent trial in which a jury found that he had not paid a
former consultant almost $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief concession speech, Cook accused reporters of
blowing his past out of proportion and denounced the Republican
leadership in Washington for withholding full support, saying,
``You can't win when the party big shots won't stand up for you.''
And Wednesday, he expanded the blame to include Democrats who had
voted in the open primary solely to drive him out of office and
disgruntled former employees.
</P>
<P>
   He also broadened his criticism of party leaders, accusing them
of following ``two sets of rules, one for incumbents, one for
Merrill Cook.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he did receive considerable help from many leading
Republicans. Speaker Dennis Hastert, and the House majority leader,
Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, and the majority whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, all traveled to Utah to raise money for Cook.
</P>
<P>
   But some other House Republicans, including Rep. Christopher
Cannon, who represents Utah's 3rd Congressional District, supported
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who became wealthy as the owner of an explosives company,
vowed that his political career would not end after November,
hinting that he might return as an independent, which he has done
before. In eight years as an independent before he won the
congressional seat, he ran twice for governor and once for mayor of
Salt Lake City, the congressional seat, the school board and the
Salt Lake County Commission _ losing all six times.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was disheartened that so many Republican leaders
had backed Cook, which, he said, ``drove home a point: If you're
challenging an incumbent, you better be prepared to stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's their job,'' he added. ``If I'm the incumbent in
two years, I would expect them to support me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still wide-eyed after a sleepless night, much of it spent
celebrating, Smith said he felt relieved that he could now look
forward to a campaign against Matheson that he predicted would
focus more on issues than personality. He said a barrage of attacks
by Cook had forced him to spend time defending himself, rather than
discussing issues like education reform, tax cuts, job creation and
expanding voter participation through use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he was eager to bring stability to the seat, which
represents parts of Salt Lake City and several adjacent counties.
The winner in November will become the district's fifth
representative in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Thomas Davis III, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement that the
party would now throw its full support behind Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is a Republican incumbent lost,'' Davis, of
Virginia, said. ``The good news is we have a strong nominee in this
seat for the fall. Merrill Cook has been a fine representative for
the citizens of Utah, working tirelessly on their behalf. His
presence will be missed here in Washington after November. I wish
him all the best, and I am confident he will join us in supporting
Derek Smith this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook said he would have to think about it.

THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES WHEN IT COMES TO JOB SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few days after the Teamsters and Associated Wholesale Grocers
reached an agreement that allowed the union workers to return to
their jobs, I received a plaintive note.
</P>
<P>
   The man who wrote would not be returning to the AWG warehouse.
He'd read the economic tea leaves earlier in the year, when the
company announced its intention to outsource management of its
warehouse operations. He'd foreseen labor strife and possible job
loss and elected to look for another job.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly found work elsewhere and thought he'd done a good
thing. But the labor impasse was broken after a few weeks, and his
former work mates got their jobs back, with back pay and raises.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately he regretted his move and asked if he could get his
job back, too. Yes, he was told, but because you quit, you've lost
your seniority and the preferable workhours that come with it.
You'll have to start over at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   So much for trying to plan ahead and ensure a steady income, he
ruminated.
</P>
<P>
   On a grander scale, this week's Justice Department announcements
dooming the WorldCom-Sprint merger may be causing similar second
thoughts among Sprint workers who have already jumped ship on the
expectation that their post-merger futures were rocky.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no sizable Sprint exodus, but a smattering of key
executives, would-be entrepreneurs and folks looking for what they
thought was a surer opportunity have left. Too much remains up in
the air to second-guess the wisdom of any departure.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who stayed the course, in both the AWG and Sprint
situations, have been buffeted by change, too. For them as well,
too much remains up in the air to second-guess the wisdom of
hanging tight.
</P>
<P>
   There is no blueprint, no right answer, no sure path to
financial and emotional security. Career choices and the outcomes
of those choices are as varied as the individual worker and the
individual circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional career advice says we should always have a Plan B
in mind. It says that we are responsible for our own paycheck
security, that the paternal corporation is dead. It says we should
plan ahead and leap before we are pushed.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no guarantee that if we leap, we won't regret it.
There's no calendar that dictates the exact right time to change
jobs. There's no promise that a new job will be better or more
profitable than the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Workers struggling with ``Do I stay?'' or ``Do I go?'' decisions
need to ask the kind of question that Ann and Abby ask their letter
writers. When someone asks the columnists for advice about staying
in or leaving a relationship, they often respond, ``Are you better
off with him/her or without him/her?''
</P>
<P>
   In love lives, as in work lives, the answer almost never is
known until after the choice has been made.
</P>
<P>
   That may frustrate people who want quick, clear direction, but
that's the way it is. The best any worker can do is research
options, weigh the ups and downs of either choice, and then work
hard to validate the choice.

CENSUS BUREAU SEEKS MORE INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just when you thought all the questions had
been asked and answered, the Census is back.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Census Bureau sent questionnaires to 120 million
households, got 65 percent of them back and has since reached 99
percent of the rest of American families, it wants even more
information.
</P>
<P>
   About 700,000 households around the country, including some in
the Kansas City area, are receiving letters informing them they
would receive a ``supplementary'' questionnaire called the American
Community Survey.
</P>
<P>
   It covers the same social and economic topics included in the
long form of the regular Census.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials want to conduct that survey every year,
eventually replacing the long form. Fewer people would be
inconvenienced at one time, but the government would get a better
picture of the changing nation, instead of a snapshot every 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Census Bureau publication, ``Communities can use
the data to track the well-being of children, families and the
elderly; determine where to locate new highways, schools and
hospitals; show a large corporation that a town has a work force
the company needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Community Survey is being tested in 31 sites
nationwide, but if Congress approves it would be expanded to reach
every county by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The regular Census, conducted every 10 years, has two parts. One
is a simple head count to determine the number of seats each state
has in the House of Representatives. That is accomplished with the
short form and would continue once a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The other part, the long form, is used to distribute federal
money for housing, education, health and other programs. This year,
the amount is $185 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But spending decisions made in 1999 were based on data collected
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get under-counted, you're a loser throughout the
decade,'' regional Census Director Henry Palacios told The Star in
an interview this spring.
</P>
<P>
   With the annual survey, the government can extrapolate from a
sample of data collected each year to make spending decisions. The
survey can be changed, with questions added or deleted, to reflect
social and political trends.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 1 percent of the households that received a Census
short form this year also will be asked to fill out the additional
survey. No one who was randomly picked to receive the long form
this year is supposed to be tapped for the supplementary survey.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, a sample of households will be selected from a
master address file to receive the survey. If approved for full
implementation, 3 million households would be surveyed each year.
No household is supposed to be surveyed more than once every five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Census, participation in the American Community Survey
is mandatory. Answers are confidential. As with the regular Census,
households that do not respond will be contacted by Census workers.

   (UNDATED) _ The new United Nations commission for arms
inspection in Iraq is likely to be used by the U.S. government to
trigger a confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the
run-up to the November presidential elections, a former U.N.
inspector claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, who resigned from the previous UNSCOM, said it was
commonly recognized in Washington and New York that the new
mission, under the chairmanship of Hans Blix, has no realistic
chance of being allowed into Iraq while sanctions and air strikes
by American and Britain continues.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's blocking, he maintained, would be used by Washington as
an example of non-compliance to the U.N., leading the way to an
escalation of bombing without the U.N. Security Council being asked
to vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. Marine Intelligence Colonel left his post with
UNSCOM in August 1998 after complaining that information covertly
gathered by the U.N. was turned over to the U.S. by the team's
chief Australian Richard Butler, and used in the bombing campaign
Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter was in London to address the inaugural meeting of the
Great Britain Iraq Society. The man once accused by the Iraqis of
being a CIA spy, now believes that the sanctions against Iraq are
doing nothing to damage Saddam's regime and only victimizing the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Independent Ritter accused the U.S.
government of hypocrisy, and Britain of acquiescing to this.
</P>
<P>
   He said that both government's knew Iraq did not now possess the
capability for using weapons of mass destruction, but the Clinton
administration was still pursuing a cynical policy for short-term
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new commission, UNMOVIC, will not be allowed into Iraq in
August, a month of primaries and three months away from the
election. You have got a vice president, Al Gore, trailing behind
in the polls and what better way to appear tough and switch
attention away to a so-called foreign threat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. Security Council did not vote on Desert Fox and we
can expect the same thing to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would not like to take unilateral action; it needs
Britain to give it in appearance of something multilateral,'' said
Ritter. ``And sadly, when the U.S. says jump, Tony Blair asks `how
high?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing,'' he continued, ``is that the longer the
inspectors stay away from Iraq, the more time the hard-liners there
have to rebuild their weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence services of the U.S., Britain and Israel
realize this, but there is nothing they can do while the U.S.
administration wants to keep Iraq as the whipping boy they can
wheel out at times of domestic difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter has held extensive talks with congressmen in Washington.
He said: ``Both Republicans and Democrats accept the current policy
on Iraq is a mess. But it seems little will be done this side of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's strident criticism has led to the U.S. government
launching a FBI investigation into allegations that he had supplied
Intelligence to the Israelis. On the subject, Ritter said: ``That
started in 1996 and is still going on. It has cost me $120,000 in
legal fees so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``After endless requests the FBI finally agreed to meet me last
month. I am not demeaning their investigation, it is a very serious
issue, but I have nothing to hide.'' &QL;

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Umpire Mike DiMuro again refused comment Wednesday one
day after ejecting Anaheim Angels pitcher Tim Belcher from
Tuesday's game in the second inning, saying only that he filed his
report with the major-league office.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire DiMuro called a balk on Belcher after fake pickoff
attempts to third and first. The ruling was that Belcher crossed
the imaginary 45-degree line and stepped more toward home than
third, thus the balk. Belcher was ejected almost immediately after
running to confront DiMuro.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher and manager Mike Scioscia argued that Belcher did
nothing to deserve an ejection. But crew chief Brian Gorman said
Wednesday that arguing a balk is means for an automatic ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's frustrating in my mind is that pitchers
aren't afforded the same equality in arguing with the umpires as a
hitter is,'' Belcher said. ``That's always bothered me. A hitter
can see 16 pitches, bitch and complain on 13 of them and stay in
the game. A pitcher does it and the ump says, 'Get back on the
mound and pitch. Shut your mouth.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I not allowed to disagree with a call? I'm not making
gestures and complaining on every pitch. They can do it, why can't
I?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Team meeting: Scioscia says he is not big on team meetings,
but he held one before Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more of a communication guy, I talk to these guys every
day,'' Scioscia said. ``We went over a couple things, nothing huge.
I just wanted to refresh some things, go over some things. It was
not a chew-out meeting. The effort is there. It's just keeping
everybody on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said his chat centered on focusing on fundamental
baseball, things like playing aggressive defense and improving
situational hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We addressed some focus issues, some individual defense
issues, how we're going to approach the next six weeks,'' Scioscia
said. ``We want to make sure we're prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Defensive dropoff: With Jim Edmonds in center, Gary DiSarcina
at shortstop and Randy Velarde at second base, the Angels defense
up the middle used to be one of the best in the league. Now,
because of injuries and trades, it's Garret Anderson in center,
Benji Gil at shortstop and Adam Kennedy at second.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, though, says it's unfair to compare Anderson with
Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could put Willie Mays out there and some people still
might like Jim Edmonds,'' he said. ``No one expects Garret to do
what Jim Edmonds did. But Garret has potential to be an outstanding
center fielder. For a guy that hasn't played out there a lot at the
major-league level, he's making strides every day.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hatcher returns: Hitting coach Mickey Hatcher returned to the
team Wednesday after missing Tuesday's game so he could be with his
daughter, who had back surgery.

   (UNDATED) _ The new United Nations commission for arms
inspection in Iraq is likely to be used by the U.S. government to
trigger a confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the
run-up to the November presidential elections, a former U.N.
inspector claimed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, who resigned from the previous UNSCOM, said it was
commonly recognized in Washington and New York that the new
mission, under the chairmanship of Hans Blix, has no realistic
chance of being allowed into Iraq while sanctions and air strikes
by American and Britain continues.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's blocking, he maintained, would be used by Washington as
an example of non-compliance to the U.N., leading the way to an
escalation of bombing without the U.N. Security Council being asked
to vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. Marine Intelligence Colonel left his post with
UNSCOM in August 1998 after complaining that information covertly
gathered by the U.N. was turned over to the U.S. by the team's
chief Australian Richard Butler, and used in the bombing campaign
Operation Desert Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Ritter was in London to address the inaugural meeting of the
Great Britain Iraq Society. The man once accused by the Iraqis of
being a CIA spy, now believes that the sanctions against Iraq are
doing nothing to damage Saddam's regime and only victimizing the
civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Independent Ritter accused the U.S.
government of hypocrisy, and Britain of acquiescing to this.
</P>
<P>
   He said that both government's knew Iraq did not now possess the
capability for using weapons of mass destruction, but the Clinton
administration was still pursuing a cynical policy for short-term
political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new commission, UNMOVIC, will not be allowed into Iraq in
August, a month of primaries and three months away from the
election. You have got a vice president, Al Gore, trailing behind
in the polls and what better way to appear tough and switch
attention away to a so-called foreign threat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. Security Council did not vote on Desert Fox and we
can expect the same thing to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. would not like to take unilateral action; it needs
Britain to give it in appearance of something multilateral,'' said
Ritter. ``And sadly, when the U.S. says jump, Tony Blair asks `how
high?'
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing,'' he continued, ``is that the longer the
inspectors stay away from Iraq, the more time the hard-liners there
have to rebuild their weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence services of the U.S., Britain and Israel
realize this, but there is nothing they can do while the U.S.
administration wants to keep Iraq as the whipping boy they can
wheel out at times of domestic difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter has held extensive talks with congressmen in Washington.
He said: ``Both Republicans and Democrats accept the current policy
on Iraq is a mess. But it seems little will be done this side of
the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter's strident criticism has led to the U.S. government
launching a FBI investigation into allegations that he had supplied
Intelligence to the Israelis. On the subject, Ritter said: ``That
started in 1996 and is still going on. It has cost me $120,000 in
legal fees so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``After endless requests the FBI finally agreed to meet me last
month. I am not demeaning their investigation, it is a very serious
issue, but I have nothing to hide.'' &QL;

EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS FAULT COMMISSIONER
</HEADLINE>

By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ The resignation of Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush was greeted with muted cheers Wednesday at the
epicenter of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge Earthquake victims were glad to see Quackenbush leave
but skeptical whether his resignation would help settle their
insurance claims or whether he would be prosecuted for his charged
misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Allison, for example, said in only 10 seconds most of her
life was destroyed, yet six years later she hasn't been able to
piece it back together. She blames Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living with no hot water, no central heat in a tagged
house unfit to live in, for the past six years,'' said Allison, who
is battling her insurer for more than $749,000 for repairs on her
Northridge home damaged in the Jan. 17, 1994, temblor. ``I've lost
custody of my children. I don't know how much worse it could get.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with stories like Allison's and growing evidence that he
profited politically by reportedly misusing $12.45 million of
insurance settlement funds, Quackenbush resigned Wednesday,
effective July 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the decision Mr. Quackenbush has made is the
right one,'' said Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys. ``The
facts gathered by this committee make clear that the commissioner
can no longer claim the public trust necessary to continue serving
in office.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignation prevents state legislators from impeaching
Quackenbush, but civil and criminal charges may still be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad because a lot of what (Quackenbush) has done can't be
undone,'' said George Kehrer, executive director of Community
Assisting Recovery Inc., which helps hundreds of quake victims who
say their claims were mishandled by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bright side is now the department can focus on the
real problem and figure out how to create restitution for people in
the Valley whose claims were mishandled. There were hundreds of
millions of dollars that could have gone toward restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal stems from the Insurance Department having
threatened insurance companies with $3.7 billion in fines for
mishandling thousands of Northridge Quake victim claims.
Quackenbush let a half-dozen insurers settle their cases by paying
a total of $12.45 million to the newly created California Research
and Assistance Fund, which then aired television public service
announcements for quake preparations featuring Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers, many of whom say they simply followed
Quackenbush's directive to pay into the fund, had little comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a difficult situation for all parties
involved,'' said Allstate Insurance spokesman Justine Schmidt.
``Allstate stands ready to do what we can to facilitate a smooth
transition as a new commissioner takes office.''
</P>
<P>
   Ric Hill of Woodland Hills-based 21st Century Insurance said the
company was ``looking forward to working with whomever the governor
and Legislature decide to appoint as the next commissioner.'' He
declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left with other insurers were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of the best news I've heard in months,'' said
Rick Bennett, who lives at the Devonshire Village Condominiums in
Northridge, which sustained heavy damage in the magnitude-6.7
quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance companies no longer have an ally sitting up
there in Sacramento,'' Bennett said. ``I hope this means we'll see
thousands of mishandled cases reopened, including ours. But we want
to see him behind bars also, because what Mr. Quackenbush did was
worse than murder. What he did impacts tens of thousands of
homeowners.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Webb, a former Simi Valley City Council member who
launched a recall drive against Quackenbush earlier this month,
said more than 10,000 people downloaded a recall signature form
from the Web site of her group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a race between him quitting and us recalling him,''
Webb said. ``I'm surprised he lasted this long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office announced Wednesday that it will
look into whether Quackenbush can be held personally liable for
repaying the $12.45 million in insurance settlements.

CLIPPERS GO TO HIGH SCHOOL TO GET MILES
</HEADLINE>
  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Most of his fellow draftees were pressing their
shirts and nervously waiting for their dry-cleaned suits to arrive
at the hotel. Darius Miles spent the anxious hours before Wednesday
night's NBA draft like most teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played Super Mario Brothers with my best friend,'' Miles
said. ``Video games, movies. Anything to kill the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids, they're so impatient. Miles had to wait only 18 years and
8 months to become the highest-drafted high school player. Taken
third by the Los Angeles Clippers before a few thousand stunned
fans at the Target Center, Miles stole the attention and thunder
from many of the other well-known prospects.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Cincinnati power forward Kenyon Martin went No.
1 to the New Jersey Nets, and the Vancouver Grizzlies plucked
Stromile Swift out of Louisiana State as the second pick.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls chose Marcus Fizer of Iowa State, the power forward
who was thought to be going to the Clippers with the third pick, at
No. 4. Florida's Mike Miller went No. 5 to the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's Cincinnati teammate, DerMarr Johnson, was taken No. 6
by the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing development of the night involved the Magic,
who dumped two of their lottery picks _ Nos. 10 and 13 _ and two of
their players to create salary cap room for the beginning of the
free-agent signing period that begins July 1. Tim Duncan and Grant
Hill may be pipe dreams no longer.
</P>
<P>
   Keyon Dooling, the No. 10 pick, was sent to the Clippers along
with Derek Strong and Corey Magette for a future first-round pick.
And the rights to the Magic's pick at No. 13, Courtney Alexander,
the nation's leading scorer out of Fresno State, were dealt to
Dallas for a future first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   The draft again had a young flavor. After Martin, 10 straight
underclassmen were taken. DeShawn Stevenson became the 11th player
in the last five years to go straight from high school to the NBA
when the Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.) senior was selected 23rd
by the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of St. John's Erick Barkley at No. 28 by the
Portland Blazers broke the record for underclassmen selected in the
first round of the draft. Eighteen were picked, breaking the mark
of 17 set in the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a record seven players born outside the United
States were drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett had been the highest-selected prep player when he
was taken fifth in 1995, but the 6-foot-9-inch, 217-pound,
wafer-thin Miles surpassed his idol, who plays for the hometown
Timberwolves. Walking to the podium with a radiant smile, Miles
wore an oversized gray suit and a gold hoop earring. He was so
excited about the selection, he hugged Stern and patted the
commissioner's graying thatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I have a couple of good years, you guys will say
that's the greatest high school player ever to get picked,'' said
Miles, from East St. Louis High (Ill.), who became the 14th player
in the modern era to go straight to the NBA from high school. He is
the 10th high school player since Garnett was taken in 1995 to be
drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's entrance was almost as electrifying. The highlight tape
rolled before he strode toward the podium in a Nets baseball cap.
Ducking inside for strong layups, rejecting shots or taking
alley-oop passes and throwing them down maliciously, he looked
great on celluloid.
</P>
<P>
   With Martin unable to work out for teams because he broke his
leg three months ago during the NCAA tournament, video was all the
Nets had to go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenyon was the best player in the draft,'' Miles said. ``He
worked hard for four years in college. I'm just a high school
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   A teary-eyed Martin said: ``These last three months have been
outrageous for me _ knee-rehabbing and all that stuff. It's been
unreal. When they called my name it was like a sigh of relief. I
worked so hard for four years, and now I guess it's panning out for
me. I can't stop now. I have to get better from here and just move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the consensus player of the year, became the third
senior chosen No. 1 overall in the past four years and the first
player from Cincinnati to be taken with the first pick. Oscar
Robertson was a territorial choice of the Cincinnati Royals in
1960, and thus was not eligible to be selected by any other team.
</P>
<P>
   Miles talked of how much a fan he was of Garnett and Chris
Webber, his two favorite players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at K.G. a little more because he was in the same
situation as me, and he went through the same things,'' Miles said.
``He's a great man and a great player. Hopefully, I can be a lot
like him.''
</P>
<P>
   He also did not say anything disparaging about the Clippers, the
losing franchise that has jaded some of the brightest and youngest
NBA stars over the past two decades. ``I think the Clippers are a
good, young team,'' he said. ``I feel we can develop as the years
go on, and hopefully we'll be a playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   If Miles beaming or Martin crying in the green room did not
qualify as the draft's most touching moments, then Mateen Cleaves'
going to Detroit as the seventh pick a few months after he led
Michigan State to the national title did.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, a 6-2 guard, joined Morris Peterson, taken 21st by
Toronto, as the second group of teammates to be selected in the
first round after Martin and Johnson. ``I had to pinch myself when
we won it all, and I have to pinch myself now,'' Cleaves said.
``Seems like a fairy tale, me going home to Detroit. I'm going to
have to place a call to Grant and tell him to stay. I'd be honored
to be his teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mihm, the 7-foot Texas center, was taken seventh by the
Bulls, and the Michigan freshman Jamal Crawford was selected eighth
by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Shortly afterward, the two teams
swapped picks. The Bulls traded the rights to Mihm and an
undisclosed amount of cash for Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10, the Houston Rockets selected Minnesota
center Joel Przybilla. The Gophers sophomore, who quit school amid
the university's academic scandal, received a chorus of boos before
he took the podium to meet Commissioner David Stern. He was later
traded to Milwaukee for Jason Collier, the Bucks' No. 15 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Speedy Claxton of Hofstra was taken No. 20 by the 76ers. The
5-11 point guard wowed scouts at the pre-draft camps, including his
breathtaking two-handed dunk in Chicago last month that stunned the
gathering of general managers and coaches.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The U.S. software giant Oracle made the
sensational admission Wednesday that it had hired a firm of private
detectives to discredit its arch-rival Microsoft and undermine its
efforts to fend off the government's antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after a flurry of office break-ins,
computer laptop thefts, and attempts to buy off janitorial staff at
consultancy firms associated with Bill Gates' company.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a hastily orchestrated piece of damage
control, Oracle admitted it had hired Investigation Group
International to try to establish links between Microsoft and a
number of supposedly independent consultancy firms, which had
testified on its behalf in court. It insisted, however, that it had
not sanctioned any illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said it had ordered the investigation into two groups,
the Independent Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, because
it suspected they were not as impartial as they claimed. Evidence
of their financial links to Microsoft subsequently appeared in The
Wall Street Journal and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact their work was funded by Microsoft for the express
purpose of influencing public opinion...'' an Oracle company
statement alleged. ``Left undisclosed, these Microsoft front groups
could have improperly influenced the outcome of one of the most
important cases in U.S. history,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Oracle statement made no mention of a third group,
the Association for Competitive Technology, which recently reported
a woman investigator trying to obtain its trash by offering cash to
its office cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   It also made no mention of a series of laptop thefts reported at
yet another group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, whose links to
Microsoft were subsequently written up in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Institute has also complained of laptops going
missing. Microsoft suffered a break-in at its Washington office
earlier this month, although it has yet to determine if any
important effects or documents were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle statement said it did not stipulate how IGI should go
about its investigations. ``We did, however, insist that whatever
methods IGI employed, those methods must be legal. IGI repeatedly
assured us that all their activities were in fact 100 percent
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. business press, ever sensitive to the bitter rivalry
between Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Oracle's chief executive,
Larry Ellison, are delighting in what they are already describing
as a Watergate-style scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Microsoft antitrust suit, Ellison has taken the
moral high ground, describing Gates as a ``convicted monopolist''
and arguing for an aggressive company break-up to stem his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when someone breaks the law, he should be punished,''
Ellison told The Independent in an interview in January. Now,
however, the pressure is on for Ellison to demonstrate that he did
not stray from the high ground himself.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the private investigation affair, The Wall Street
Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had hired a Washington
public-relations firm, Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter and Associates,
to circulate damaging stories about Microsoft in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dramatic proof that Microsoft's competitors have been
funding and orchestrating a massive PR and lobbying campaign in an
effort to tarnish Microsoft's image and invite government
intervention in an industry that has been very competitive and
serving consumers very well,'' a Microsoft spokesman said. ``We
think it's a very sad day and a huge embarrassment for Oracle and
all its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode that first put the spotlight on IGI occurred on June
1, when a team of cleaners at the Washington offices of the
Association for Competitive Technology was approached by a woman
asking if she could buy their trash.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying herself as Blanca Lopez and speaking Spanish to the
Latino cleaning crew, she said she was investigating a criminal
case and wanted the trash moved to the adjacent offices of a firm
called Upstream Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaners turned down her offer, and rebuffed her again five
days later when she came back with $1,200 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream Technologies, which only began leasing the office space
last month, has since shut up shop and appears to have been a
phantom organization. The person whose name appeared on the lease
application, Robert Walters, has been identified in the past as an
IGI investigator.

 By ANDREW GUMBEL  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The U.S. software giant Oracle made the
sensational admission Wednesday that it had hired a firm of private
detectives to discredit its arch-rival Microsoft and undermine its
efforts to fend off the government's antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after a flurry of office break-ins,
computer laptop thefts, and attempts to buy off janitorial staff at
consultancy firms associated with Bill Gates' company.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be a hastily orchestrated piece of damage
control, Oracle admitted it had hired Investigation Group
International to try to establish links between Microsoft and a
number of supposedly independent consultancy firms, which had
testified on its behalf in court. It insisted, however, that it had
not sanctioned any illegal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said it had ordered the investigation into two groups,
the Independent Institute and the National Taxpayers Union, because
it suspected they were not as impartial as they claimed. Evidence
of their financial links to Microsoft subsequently appeared in The
Wall Street Journal and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact their work was funded by Microsoft for the express
purpose of influencing public opinion...'' an Oracle company
statement alleged. ``Left undisclosed, these Microsoft front groups
could have improperly influenced the outcome of one of the most
important cases in U.S. history,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Oracle statement made no mention of a third group,
the Association for Competitive Technology, which recently reported
a woman investigator trying to obtain its trash by offering cash to
its office cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   It also made no mention of a series of laptop thefts reported at
yet another group, Citizens for a Sound Economy, whose links to
Microsoft were subsequently written up in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Institute has also complained of laptops going
missing. Microsoft suffered a break-in at its Washington office
earlier this month, although it has yet to determine if any
important effects or documents were taken.
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle statement said it did not stipulate how IGI should go
about its investigations. ``We did, however, insist that whatever
methods IGI employed, those methods must be legal. IGI repeatedly
assured us that all their activities were in fact 100 percent
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. business press, ever sensitive to the bitter rivalry
between Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Oracle's chief executive,
Larry Ellison, are delighting in what they are already describing
as a Watergate-style scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Microsoft antitrust suit, Ellison has taken the
moral high ground, describing Gates as a ``convicted monopolist''
and arguing for an aggressive company break-up to stem his power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when someone breaks the law, he should be punished,''
Ellison told The Independent in an interview in January. Now,
however, the pressure is on for Ellison to demonstrate that he did
not stray from the high ground himself.
</P>
<P>
   On top of the private investigation affair, The Wall Street
Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had hired a Washington
public-relations firm, Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter and Associates,
to circulate damaging stories about Microsoft in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is dramatic proof that Microsoft's competitors have been
funding and orchestrating a massive PR and lobbying campaign in an
effort to tarnish Microsoft's image and invite government
intervention in an industry that has been very competitive and
serving consumers very well,'' a Microsoft spokesman said. ``We
think it's a very sad day and a huge embarrassment for Oracle and
all its employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode that first put the spotlight on IGI occurred on June
1, when a team of cleaners at the Washington offices of the
Association for Competitive Technology was approached by a woman
asking if she could buy their trash.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying herself as Blanca Lopez and speaking Spanish to the
Latino cleaning crew, she said she was investigating a criminal
case and wanted the trash moved to the adjacent offices of a firm
called Upstream Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaners turned down her offer, and rebuffed her again five
days later when she came back with $1,200 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Upstream Technologies, which only began leasing the office space
last month, has since shut up shop and appears to have been a
phantom organization. The person whose name appeared on the lease
application, Robert Walters, has been identified in the past as an
IGI investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Zuck, the Association for Competitive Technology's
president, was quoted Wednesday describing the trash episode as
``despicable'' and said he was contemplating legal action for
violation of his employees' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope to get a letter of apology from Larry Ellison and
an explanation of how, in a climate over so much concern over the
issue of privacy, he could think this is an acceptable business
practice,'' he told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not dumpster-diving in offices outside the building,
this is bribery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Oracle refusing to acknowledge any link with the episode,
Ellison now faces the famous Watergate question: what did he know,
and when did he know it?

SPRINT FACES FALLING SHARE PRICE, GROWING QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ As Sprint Corp. sifts through the remains of
its proposed sale to WorldCom, the questions on most people's lips
are: What happens to the company next, and how will it prop up its
sagging stock price?
</P>
<P>
   Many shareholders hope William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman,
finds another suitor to buy the company. Sprint shares plunged
almost 10 percent on Wednesday, closing at 52 and 203//256, as
investors digested the news that they wouldn't be getting the
promised $76 a share for their Sprint holdings anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The stock that tracks the company's wireless business, Sprint
PCS, fared a little better, dropping 4 percent, reflecting the loss
of the premium that WorldCom would have paid to PCS shareholders in
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WorldCom shares rose 4 and 7//8 to 44 and 9//16.
Investors were apparently relieved, because they thought an
expensive deal with Sprint would put an anchor on WorldCom
earnings, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the drop in Sprint's stock Wednesday may have come as
traders who invested in Sprint betting the deal would go through
unwound their positions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Burnett at Merger Insight, however, Sprint's
stock could possibly trade as low as the mid-40s before investors
settle in and wait for the next deal to happen.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint have not officially called off their
marriage yet, but to go forward they would have to make a valid
argument for the merger in court, observers say. The temptation is
probably there, considering the speed at which the long-distance
market is being opened to the regional Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell, for example, hopes to get approval Friday to
enter Texas' long-distance market, and on Wednesday asked Missouri
regulators to let it provide long-distance to customers in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the time, expense and uncertainty of the outcome
of a court case, they companies won't likely go that route,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice's lawsuit seeking to block the
WorldCom-Sprint deal, filed Tuesday, ``effectively means the deal
will not go through,'' said Tim Horan, an analyst with CIBC World
Markets, in a research report.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union joined the Department of Justice on
Wednesday, announcing that it was formally blocking the deal, even
though the companies withdrew their application to merge on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   European competition commissioner Mario Monti explained that his
agency ``felt compelled'' to act as the companies have yet to
formally cancel their merger agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Many expect the companies to formally announce that they're
scrapping their deal later this week, or after the Fourth of July
holiday, and then hold a conference call with analysts to reassure
Wall Street about their prospects going forward.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the deal is a big blow to Esrey. A former
investment banker, he reportedly engineered the WorldCom deal in
the first place, playing WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers
off BellSouth Corp. to win a premium most analysts thought huge at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey could have pointed to that premium as the crowning
achievement of a successful 15-year stint at the helm of Kansas
City's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   And he certainly feels the financial pain of the deal's
collapse. He personally owns or has options on hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of Sprint stock.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the deal is collapsing, Esrey is also watching a flow
of senior executives leaving Sprint with millions of dollars in
vested stock options in hand.
</P>
<P>
   So how much pressure does he face to bring about another merger?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not under any extreme pressure, not enough to do
something desperate,'' Burnett said. ``There will be plenty of
traffic between Atlanta and Germany'' to assess interest from
potential suitors BellSouth and Deutsche Telekom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stock holds in the 50s, he'll have time to right the
ship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Righting the ship probably means selling the company eventually,
analysts say. But that may not come for months as Esrey explores
his options.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Comack, an analyst with Guzman &AMP; Co. in Miami, doubts
that BellSouth is still interested in a Sprint deal, despite its
$100 billion bid for the company in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have changed,'' he said. BellSouth has ``entered into a
joint venture with SBC for wireless services and established a
partnership with Qwest, who will haul their long distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've moved on and are going out with someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some say a deal with Deutsche Telekom will face
difficulties. The German government still owns a large chunk of the
former state monopoly, and any bid for an American company would
doubtless raise hackles in Washington. One senator, Fritz Hollings
of South Carolina, has already proposed legislation barring such a
foreign purchase. If Telekom is allowed to bid, it might prefer an
alliance with Qwest, as that company owns part of KPN Qwest, a
fast-growing Internet backbone in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to less traditional partners for Sprint, along the
lines of the Time Warner//America Online merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who it would be exactly, but the options that are
out there are kind of exciting,'' said John Hoffman, a former
senior vice president with the company. ``Sprint's always been a
trailblazer, an innovator. Now may be the time.''

LAPD PROTESTS PLAN FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writer Rick Orlov contributed to this report.) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Warning they expect violent protests at the
Democratic National Convention in mid-August, top LAPD officials
urged the City Council on Wednesday to rescind its plan to turn
over Pershing Square to up to 50,000 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Police are braced to make mass arrests of renegade protesters
and anarchists and prepared to get backup from 40 other local
enforcement agencies and the National Guard if needed, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully expect to be involved in mass arrests and civil
disturbance,'' said LAPD Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, head of the DNC
Planning Group. ``We anticipate a level similar to that which we
saw in Seattle, if indeed not more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle during the World Trade Organization meeting, police
arrested 660 people as 50,000 protesters, many of them anarchists,
caused $2.5 million in damage to downtown businesses. National
media captured scenes of protesters smashing storefronts, blocking
city streets and defying officers clad in riot gear and armed with
rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzen and Police Chief Bernard C. Parks warned the council
that anarchist groups already are planning to demonstrate before
the convention, which will be Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Parks told the council that city, state and federal law
enforcement agencies have been planning for a year for the
convention and will be prepared to protect the delegates, other
visitors and residents.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city can ask the Sheriff's Department to mobilize
more than 40 police agencies in the county if necessary and that
the governor can be called upon to send the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Lorenzen showed the council an 11-minute video of
scenes from violent protests in other cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city may regret that it ever voted to bring this
convention here, because you invited a lot of things here that you
didn't think about,'' said Councilman Hal Bernson of Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Lorenzen told the council that 6,000 LAPD officers
have been trained in mass arrests and crowd control and that
commanders and top-ranking officials will be dispersed throughout
the city to make on-the-spot decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But Parks also urged the council to reconsider last week's
designation of downtown's Pershing Square as a demonstration zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 mission here is to make sure that the people who
live and work here continue to have free access to their city,''
Parks said. ``We believe it is a major problem for us,
security-wise, to create a formalized demonstration area.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the City Council agreed to a demand by Councilwoman
Jackie Goldberg to designate Pershing Square as a protest area
before she cast the deciding vote for a $4 million city bailout for
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   But with several members saying they had security concerns, the
council voted Wednesday to forward the Pershing Square matter to a
newly created ad-hoc committee on the Democratic National
Convention, which will be chaired by Councilman Alex Padilla of
Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg agreed to send the issue to the committee but scolded
her fellow council members for what she called ``underhanded and
cheap'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the protests in Seattle and in Washington, D.C.,
during an International Monetary Fund meeting earlier this year,
Los Angeles civic leaders and merchants have questioned the choice
of Pershing Square, which is in a congested downtown area adjacent
to the jewelry district.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Mayor Richard Riordan offered assurances that
the police will be able to handle any demonstrations during the
convention as he defended their actions at the disturbances
following the championship victory by pro basketball's Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were absolutely right,'' Riordan said of the LAPD
decision to not immediately step in. ``If you compare us with other
major cities that have won major championships ... we had 11 minor
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the restraint shown by officers, we stopped the violence
from escalating. We had a strategic plan and it worked. The problem
is TV focused on a few bad things but didn't show the overall
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan also said the city is prepared in other aspects for the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a wedding and we have made preparations (for) ...
cleaning up the city,'' Riordan said. ``We have people from the
flower mart who will be putting out millions of flowers on the
streets. Los Angeles will be the most beautiful bride the world has
ever seen.''

STUDY SHOWS TRADEOFF IN REDUCING CLASSROOM SIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Students in smaller classes outperformed their
peers in larger settings but teacher quality has deteriorated since
the state reduced primary grade class sizes, a study released
Wednesday shows.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of educational research groups studying the
four-year-old program found that the number of California students
in reduced-size classes who performed at the national median or
greater was about one to four percent higher than the number in
larger classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a small increment, but it is significant,'' said George
Bohrnstedt, senior vice president for research at American
Institutes for Research.
</P>
<P>
   Groups conducting the state-commissioned study, which cost
$500,000, include the American Institutes for Research, RAND and
Policy Analysis for California Education.
</P>
<P>
   The state's class-size reduction program, launched in 1996, pays
districts $800 per student enrolled in a class of 20 or fewer in
kindergarten through third grade.
</P>
<P>
   The program was implemented quickly, according to the study, and
by last year, more than 92 percent of California students in
primary grades were in classes of 20 or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   But that progress has come at a cost, the study found. As
districts scrambled to fill the new classrooms created by
class-size reduction, they resorted to hiring more underqualified
teachers without full credentials, or with less education and
experience.
</P>
<P>
   They also found the problem of underqualified teachers went
beyond the grades where class-size has been implemented. Because
there are better-paying professions and high demand for workers in
other industries, finding qualified and experienced teachers for
all grade levels grew more difficult for schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tight labor market in California and the competition for
workers is having its toll on qualification of teachers at the
secondary level as well,'' Bohrnstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Unified School District board member Valerie Fields
said that while the district did implement class-size reduction in
those lower grades, right now the district's space shortage is a
more important concern. The district needs to build at least 150
more schools during the next decade to accomodate a surge in
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facilities is a higher priority because we're stuck at this
point,'' Fields said. ``It's hard to reduce class size any more
because we don't have any place to put them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, recalling her days as a teacher in some West San Fernando
Valley schools, she said reducing class size makes a ``huge
difference'' in student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state reduced class sizes, the percentage of fully
credentialed teachers statewide in kindergarten through third grade
dropped to 86.6 percent last year, down from 98.2 percent in 1995,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Becki Robinson, a vice president of United Teachers Los Angeles,
argued if districts would offer better salaries, more teachers
would stay in the profession, reducing the need to hire
underqualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If salaries were higher, you'd have people who are now going
into other professions (choose teaching),'' Robinson said.
``Because teaching does not pay them enough to support their family
in the way they'd like to be able to support their families.''

FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE ISN'T OFTEN ACHIEVED THROUGH A QUICK FIX

   As Americans prepare to celebrate Independence Day, many might
be well advised to stop a moment and reflect on what it takes to
gain financial independence.
</P>
<P>
   Last Independence Day, many stock investors no doubt thought
their financial independence would be secured by a euphoric Nasdaq
market that was making them richer by the week, at least on paper.
That was then. This is now.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of early retirement may remain realistic for some, but
many others have been brought back to unpleasant reality by the
gut-wrenching price plunges suffered by high-tech and dot-com
stocks since the March massacre. The worst appears to be over, but
confidence is still shaky as all stock markets continue to back and
fill.
</P>
<P>
   Drat. Just when a carefree financial existence seems within
reach, the economics gods intervene to remind us that gaining
financial independence isn't as easy as a bull market makes it
appear.
</P>
<P>
   So, how do you achieve financial independence?
</P>
<P>
   Slowly.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that compound interest is the one true miracle
of human existence. The best example is how much you would
accumulate if you saved a penny today, and doubled the amount saved
each day for a month. A penny today, 2 cents tomorrow, 4 cents the
day after, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Before reading further, try to imagine what a nest egg would
grow to if a penny investment doubled every day for a month:
$10,000? $100,000? Half a million dollars? A million dollars?
</P>
<P>
   Most people guess far too low when confronted with this
question. The answer is $10 million. What makes this staggering
amount so difficult to fathom is that with barely a week to go in
the month the sum still wouldn't have grown to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   But, such is the phenomenon of exponential growth.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it's unlikely any of us will find an investment that
doubles our money every day. However, even modest compounded
interest rate yields will create impressive gains over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Financial independence doesn't have to depend on a highflying
stock market, either. A story concerning Groucho Marx, who is said
to have lost a bundle in the stock market, is instructive. After
losing a considerable fortune in stocks, Marx began putting all his
money in Treasury securities because they were the safest
investment on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Treasuries yields were historically low, a friend
chided Marx, saying, ``Treasuries don't pay anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do if you've got enough of them,'' Groucho replied.
</P>
<P>
   How do you get enough of any form of savings or investment?
</P>
<P>
   Each and every time you receive money in any form, you put some
of it away where it can benefit from compound growth.
</P>
<P>
   During the 20th century, those who put their money in stocks did
better on average most of the time than those who put their money
elsewhere. But those who weren't comfortable with stock market risk
also did quite well for themselves _ well enough, certainly, to
have retired with a reasonable degree of financial independence.
</P>
<P>
   The habit of thrift has succumbed to consumption for many
Americans in recent years, but achieving financial independence
always has more to do with deferring gratification than picking a
hot stock or hitting the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   It all has to do with setting goals and sticking with your plan.

SOUTHWESTERN BELL AGAIN SEEKS TO PROVIDE LONG-DISTANCE IN
MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. went back to
Missouri regulators Wednesday asking for permission to sell
long-distance services to its local telephone customers throughout
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has filed for such approval before and come up short in
proving to regulators at the Public Service Commission that its
local markets were open to competition _ the condition it needs to
meet before being allowed to offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it has since addressed the problems regulators
found, evidenced by Texas regulators' approval of the company's
application to offer long-distance service to customers in that
state.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice has approved the Texas application,
and the company expects that the Federal Communications Commission
will give its final approval Friday. If it does, Texas will become
the second state in which a Bell company is allowed to offer
long-distance service, after Bell Atlantic in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of long-distance competition by the regional Bell
companies was one point given in favor of letting WorldCom acquire
Sprint _ the deal the Department of Justice sued to block Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell had to pass a 14-point regulatory checklist to
get approval in Texas. That checklist assessed the company's
ability to process orders for service and repairs in a timely
manner and the capacity of operational support systems.
</P>
<P>
   Bell is required to resell parts of its network to competitors,
and regulators want competitors' customers to get the same service
as Bell's customers.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the company's operational support systems was
independently tested in Texas, and the company says they are the
same ones used for Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at the Missouri commission has recommended hiring
Ernst &AMP; Young to validate that the data being collected by
Southwestern Bell to measure its performance are accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell says local-service competition in the state
already is robust. It reports that it has dozens of competitors in
its local markets in Missouri _ 16 that have their own equipment
and 22 that resell Bell services. Collectively, it says, those
competitors serve 287,000 access lines, or 9.7 percent of the
overall access lines in its territory.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of those lines are business customers, but Bell
contends that competitors are serving customers out of 90 percent
of its wire centers, meaning they are not just concentrated in big
cities while ignoring rural customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission has yet to set a procedural
timetable, but an action might be taken on the matter by Dec. 1.
The matter would then go before the Justice Department and the FCC,
which makes the final determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, if they meet all the standards, they should get
in'' long-distance, said Martha Hogerty, Missouri's public counsel.
``But we have to be careful to make sure they meet the standards,
and once they're in that there are strict penalties there to
prevent backsliding.''

RELATIVES AWAIT WORD ON MISSING GIRL LINKED TO ROBINSON
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Tiffany Stasi's biological grandmother poses
the most modest of requests of the teen-ager that authorities
suspect to be the long-missing girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want her to know we're here, we're her family, and we
love her,'' said Pat Sylvester. ``I don't want to disrupt her life;
I just want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany disappeared when she was just a 4-month-old baby and her
mother, Lisa Stasi, was only 19. According to investigators'
reports, Lisa Stasi was lured from a battered women's shelter by
John E. Robinson Sr., who is accused of being a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   The young mother has not been seen for 15 years. Neither, at
least by the name she was given at birth in Kansas City, has
Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   But now sources familiar with the investigation surrounding
Robinson say detectives believe a teen-ager being raised by a
family known to the murder suspect could be Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Wednesday they have yet to go to her father,
Carl Stasi, asking for medical evidence to confirm the girl's
identity. He declined an earlier request for a blood sample,
routinely made to relatives of the missing women tied to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not feel comfortable saying we know who that young lady
is,'' said Capt. John Meier, a Lenexa police officer working on the
Robinson case. He added that authorities wanted to be careful not
to raise false hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi has talked earlier about yearning to see his
daughter, but on Wednesday referred questions about Tiffany to his
attorney. The attorney could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stasi's aunt, Karen Moore, last saw the young mother
shortly before she met Robinson, who then was promoting what turned
out to be a bogus program for unwed mothers. Lisa was separated
from Carl at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, investigative reports compiled at the time said, made
promises of job training and housing. Later he would tell
detectives she left suddenly for Denver with a new boyfriend. He
produced typewritten letters with her signature, but family members
have said she did not type and that the tone of the letters did not
strike them as authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Moore recalled a young woman in late 1985 eager for a brighter
future and who saw hope in what Robinson promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was real excited and thought she was going to start a new
life for her and her daughter,'' the aunt said. There was no hint
that she might voluntarily give up her child.
</P>
<P>
   Now Moore longs to see the child again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these (adoptive) parents of Tiffany's were victims, we
can't change the past,'' she said. ``We can't destroy this little
girl's life by taking her away. We just want her to know how many
people are here that love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore is curious about the neighborhood where the girl lives,
the parents who have her in their care and the life she leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just so concerned about her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester, the grandmother who has never seen more than pictures
of Tiffany as an infant because she lived in a different state,
learned in The Kansas City Star Tuesday that authorities had strong
leads about her granddaughter's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years she had trouble maintaining that her daughter
was still alive, but, for whatever reason, nurtured the thought
that Tiffany was in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always assumed that the baby would be OK and prayed that
it was raised in a good family,'' she said. ``Anytime a baby is
taken, I don't know, I just think that a family will take care of
her and love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester hates to contemplate that the people raising her
granddaughter might have a connection to the man suspected in her
daughter's disappearance. And she's had enough tragedy in her life:
a husband who died while Lisa was still in elementary school, a son
who committed suicide, and a daughter and grandchild gone for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to wait and find out if this is Tiffany,'' she
said. ``We can only pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Moore, Karen's daughter and a cousin of Lisa Stasi's who
lived with her for six months, joined the family in an evening of
prayer about Tiffany this week. That produced a poem.
</P>
<P>
   ... For the sight, just one small peek
</P>
<P>
   For the answers, we all seek.

SPORTS COLUMN: BROKEN LEGS CROSS PATHS ON NETS' DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The shattered leg never healed the way
it had to, but you got the impression Wednesday that Jayson
Williams was suffering more from a broken heart. When the Nets
announced his retirement via conference call, the man who talked
nonstop and without peer for much of the previous decade was not on
the line, or even in state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jayson's in Arizona,'' said Rod Thorn, the Nets' new
president, who didn't add that Williams was said to be shopping for
a winter home in Phoenix. Strange, but true: 10 years ago, Williams
was drafted by the Suns, a New York kid who didn't hide his
displeasure and later lobbied his way east.
</P>
<P>
   Most retirees tend to participate in their own valediction, but
the Nets were never good with secrets, the word was already out and
the team apparently had to clear one broken leg from the roster to
make room for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a closure about it,'' Thorn said, before
opening up Wednesday night's draft by selecting Williams'
frontcourt replacement in recuperation, the University of
Cincinnati's Kenyon Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was, even after taking the source into account, a strange
sequence of events, making official such sobering news hours before
the Nets would invite season ticket holders into the Meadowlands
Champions Center to share in their good lottery fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Good, not great. As it was the last time the Nets landed the
first pick in the NBA draft, there was no player to name this
lottery after. Eerily enough, it was also a decade ago when David
Stern stood up at the Jacob Javits Center to announce, ``With the
first pick of the 1990 draft, the New Jersey Nets select Derrick
Coleman.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year retrospective on that pick is a rousing
whoop-de-damn-do. Coleman came with character questions that were
answered soon enough. Besides Martin's broken right leg _ which the
team doctors have examined and are swearing on a stack of old Nets'
yearbooks will not be a problem _ there is the issue of his tepid
performance before his senior season, in which he averaged 18.9
points and almost 10 rebounds. As late as Martin's junior year, the
numbers were 10 and 7. ``You're talking about a young man who got
better every year,'' Thorn said, providing _ what else? _ the
sanguine spin.
</P>
<P>
   There are scouts who claim that with the exception of the truly
gifted, the Tim Duncans, rating an experienced college big man has
become a most daunting task. ``By the time he's a senior, the
question is, `Who is he playing against?''' one scout said
Wednesday. ``Most of the really good players have already gone. A
kid like Martin is 22 years old playing against guys who are either
much less talented or 18 year-olds whose bodies are not as
developed. How does he do when everyone is at least as talented and
big?''
</P>
<P>
   We'll see, but it's a shame the Nets had the vacancy in the
first place. Williams, a power forward, was the team's
center-by-default until he was injured during the 1998-99 season.
The mishap was a classic Nets' disaster, Williams entangled with
the newly-acquired Stephon Marbury, the lockout-shortened season
already lost. While everyone including his mother tended to the
point guard, Williams rolled over in agony, comforted by the
front-row ticket holder Danny Aiello.
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought Jayson Williams was more actor than player.
It would be hard to dispute that it was more fun to listen to him
than to watch the Nets' teams he anchored. Yet it is equally
important to remember that the Nets acquired Williams for two
second-round draft picks, as a replacement for the immortal Terry
Mills. He was more than a late-blooming rebounding force. He became
that rare contemporary athlete who wanted to tell everyone how
fortunate he was.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, a Nets' official related a story by
telephone about how a young boy with cancer had visited the locker
room, right after a chemotherapy treatment. While meeting some of
the players, he turned nauseous and, in trying to keep from
vomiting, began to choke. While the other players backed away,
Williams realized what was happening, swept the boy into his arms
and nearly knocked John Calipari down on his way to the trainer's
room.
</P>
<P>
   The line went quiet, and, after a few seconds, I realized the
official was quietly weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had that effect on people. He could make you laugh or
cry. He was no heralded star but he was a steal. With the first
pick in the entire draft, you hope for something more than a
rebounder with heart, but if Kenyon Martin ever fills Jayson
Williams' shoes, the Nets should be thrilled.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Hours after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear any
more arguments in the Elian Gonzalez case, the 6-year-old left
behind seven months of contention, conflict and court battles, and
returned home to Cuba Wednesday with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Elian arrived to the embrace of relatives and the excited cheers
of hundreds of flag-waving schoolchildren. A crowd of students
hurriedly bused in from their hometown of Cardenas waved flags and
chanted: ``Elian! Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   They arrived just in time to meet the two planes that ferried
Elian, his father and other friends and relatives from Washington.
Moments later, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, carried the boy
off the plane and into the arms of his grandparents, including his
two grandmothers, who had made an unsuccessful journey to reclaim
the boy in January.
</P>
<P>
   As the boy was swept up in the arms of his grandfather, his
schoolmates began singing the Cuban national anthem, as the
television announcer described the scene
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the torture they said Elian would be subjected to,''
the announcer said, referring to the claims by Cuban-Americans that
the boy was being returned to a grim fate. ``That is passion. That
is affection.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the excitement of the small crowd at the airport, Elian
was quiet, waving at times to his friends. No public remarks were
made, and Cuban officials did not plan any news conferences or
rallies.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro did not greet the child at Jose Marti
International Airport, being represented instead by Ricardo
Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly, who has guided the
campaign for Elian's return. The airport ceremony lasted only 10
minutes before the child and his entourage were whisked off in a
caravan to an undisclosed location for a long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
   The homecoming was subdued, with no other rallies or marches
taking place in the city. But Cubans were reminded of the
importance of Elian's return, much the same way that Castro had
seized on it as a case of national respect, and a way to win points
in his long battle with the United States. In countless past
rallies, the case had been used to criticize the trade embargo, the
conservative Cuban American National Foundation and the Cuban
Adjustment Act, which grants asylum to Cubans who reach U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   As national television broadcast the caravan leaving the
airport, the voice of Elpidio Valdes, Elian's favorite cartoon
character, took over the narration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, Eliancito,'' he said. ``Now we have to keep the
battle against the Cuban Adjustment Act, the blockade and the
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, his father, his stepmother, Nersy, and his half brother,
Hianny, left Dulles International Airport in Virginia at 4:41 p.m.,
just hours after the Supreme Court declined to hear arguments
presented by lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami that the child
had been denied a right to an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   As Elian and his family made their way to the airport,
television viewers watched a strikingly familiar scene from the
vantage of helicopters as the motorcade snaked its way along
traffic-free highways, a white Suburban in the lead. The coverage
was reminiscent of the white Bronco chase at the start of the O.J.
Simpson murder case in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In November, a failed crossing from Cuba drowned Elian's mother
and 10 others and left the boy floating alone in an inner-tube off
the Florida coast. The Supreme Court's decision Wednesday was the
final development in a series of court challenges brought by
Elian's Miami relatives, who cared for the boy after he was rescued
last Thanksgiving until immigration agents reunited him with his
father in late April.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement in Washington Wednesday that
Elian could go home, Cuban radio and television interrupted their
programming to proclaim the boy's impending arrival once the
injunction that kept the child and his father in the United States
expired at 4 p.m. All day, announcers praised Elian as a heroic boy
and model child, whose father showed courage and dignity throughout
the custody battle. Pastoral music played softly in the background
as images of Elian hugging his father or frolicking with his
friends in a pool slowly dissolved on the screen, giving way to an
image of the Cuban flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian had to return,'' said Roberto Perez Martinez, who was
drinking a beer with some friends in the Playa section of Havana.
``When a child is caught in the middle, people get upset. At 17 if
he wants to go on a raft, it does not matter. But today he must
come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian was to go from the airport to a reunion with relatives and
friends at an undisclosed location. From there, he would go for an
undetermined period to a special school in Havana, where teachers
and psychologists would prepare him for his return to Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the airport, Elian's father, said in brief
remarks that his experience in the United States had been a good
one. He said he hoped Cuba and the United States would strengthen
their ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all my family's suffering, I think that this has
allowed me to meet very beautiful and brilliant people in this
country,'' Gonzalez said. ``And I hope in the future, this same
impression I took from this country, can become true between Cuba
and the United States.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, asked at a news conference whether he had any
reservations about Elian's return home and his administration's
role in the outcome, said Wednesday that he had replayed it all in
his head many times, and concluded that his administration did the
proper thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I wish it had unfolded in a less dramatic, traumatic way
for all concerned?'' Clinton asked. ``Of course, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, he said, is the father's right to be with his
child, and the fact that Gonzalez was found to be a ``good'' and
``loving father.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's rescue and the attempts of his Miami relatives to keep
him in the United States unleashed an international drama that
complicated the United States' relationship with Cuba. In the end,
the drama embroiled the White House, stirred up the presidential
campaign, revitalized Fidel Castro and tarnished the standing of
the politically powerful Cuban-American population in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And in a twist that few could have anticipated, the case, and
its handling by Cuban-Americans, helped galvanize support in the
United States for more relaxed ties to Cuba. On Tuesday, Congress
negotiated a deal to permit food sales to Cuba, with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami Wednesday, supporters of the Miami relatives gathered
outside the Little Havana house to mourn Elian's return to Havana.
A few lashed out at reporters and cursed the Clinton
administration. Many praised the Miami relatives for their
persistence, and expressed disbelief that most Americans believe
Elian belongs in Communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are devastated that at this very moment Elian's going back
to live in a country where he'll never be free, to a country where
his father will simply not be allowed to give him the freedom that
his mother, Elisabeth Brotons, wanted so desperately and died for,
to a country of tyranny and dictatorship,'' said Armando Gutierrez,
the spokesman for the boy's Miami relatives. ``But we must obey the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, who had tried to persuade the Miami
relatives, face to face, to turn the boy over, wished Elian well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little boy now knows that he can remain with his
father,'' Reno said in a statement Wednesday. ``All involved have
had an opportunity to make their case _ all the way to the highest
court in the land. I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme
Court's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department spent at least $1.8 million through June
11 on reuniting Elian with his father, assigning scores of
officials and negotiators to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The legal challenge began in Miami, where Lazaro Gonzalez,
Elian's great-uncle, petitioned the courts for custody and for the
right to request an asylum hearing for the boy. That was denied,
and Gonzalez carried out a series of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In Havana Wednesday, there were few joyous outbursts, in
contrast to the huge public rallies that had taken place across
Cuba calling for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   A few people sported worn-out Elian T-shirts that were worn by
hundreds of thousands at past rallies. The sprawling seaside plaza
that was specially built in January to hold demonstrations in front
of the offices of the U.S. government here was unusually empty.
</P>
<P>
   Many people quietly expressed relief that the boy was returning
after months of what they said was manipulation by Cuban-Americans
in Miami, whom they faulted for having tried to sway the child with
gifts, favors and the promise of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time he came back to be with his family, his people,''
one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting with some friends in the shade of a fruit stand at a
market, another woman, Barbara D'Esco-H vert agreed: ``He will not
be bad off here. He has a good house ready, and a school, too. His
father wants to stay here in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend interrupted with a skepti- cal frown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Says who?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   D'Escovert shrugged him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``After everything Fidel has said, you think he would stay in
the United States?'' she continued. ``He has a duty to return. The
people put out a lot of effort for his return.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, who refused to give his name, was unswayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him well over there,'' he said. ``One day he'll
have his life made. Over there.''

MEXICAN ELECTION TAKES A NASTY TURN NEAR THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 10th graf with timing of allegations)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Standing above an immense crowd in Mexico City's
central square recently, Francisco Labastida, the governing party's
presidential candidate, kept giving his followers, over and over, a
single message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to win,'' Labastida intoned. ``We are going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is not clear, just days before the vote on Sunday,
that Labastida, the candidate of the long dominant Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is going to win, although he may.
</P>
<P>
   Even at that big rally, his supporters were oddly dispassionate.
Most had been brought in from out of town by bus and hurriedly left
after he spoke, even skipping a free concert by Juan Gabriel, one
of Mexico's most popular singers.
</P>
<P>
   The final opinion polls, published last week, show Labastida in
a tie with Vicente Fox, the right-of-center opposition candidate.
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist contender, was trailing well behind,
and millions of voters were still undecided. By law, campaigning
ended on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks PRI leaders, sensing this softness in their once
rock-hard support, have mobilized all their machinery and myriad
links to the government in a blistering campaign against Fox,
accusing him of taking illegal campaign donations from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how the voters will react to the nasty turn in the
campaign. Never before have Mexicans faced a such a close contest
under an election agency with enhanced powers to ensure an accurate
tally.
</P>
<P>
   Enrique Jackson, a leading PRI lawmaker, electrified a
congressional hearing on June 21 by displaying a series of checks
that he said proved that Fox had received donations from people and
companies in Belgium and, far worse, the United States, Mexico's
historical adversary. Campaign laws prohibit funds from businesses
and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the checks showed that Fox was backed by ``powerful
foreign groups that have an appetite for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation was made hours before Fox had a long-scheduled
prime-time interview on Televisa, the main national television
network, and he spent much of his appearance parrying questions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the checks did not indicate the money trail from
overseas to the Fox campaign that he described. One was written a
year ago, before the campaign was officially under way.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Hakim, a businessman whose company was said to have made
contributions, produced documents to show that his transactions
were not donations to Fox. Fox filed a defamation suit on Tuesday
against the PRI, but his denials have been less potent in the press
than Jackson's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI came down hard on Ramiro Berron Lara, an engineer from
Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned petroleum company better known
as Pemex. He complained in the press that his superiors had tried
to make him campaign for Labastida during working hours.
</P>
<P>
   At a new conference, the director of Pemex, Rogelio Montemayor,
a PRI politician, denied that the company had leaned on any
employee to back Labastida. He described Berron as a problem
employee who was facing disciplinary action for ``distributing
pornography'' on the company's Internet network.
</P>
<P>
   Berron responded by showing a list on which he had been assigned
to register 10 Pemex employees to vote for Labastida. He said the
``pornography'' was a joke that a friend had sent on the Web and
wondered aloud why his superiors were reading his e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, workers at one Pemex refinery complained
to the newspaper Reforma that they had been required to present
current PRI party credentials and pledge help for Labastida to
ensure their jobs and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring by the Federal Elections Institute, the government
agency that is organizing the election, showed that the broadcast
media had shifted sharply in favor of Labastida at the end of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the two major national television networks remained more
balanced, elections officials said, the news media in the
provinces, where the hottest battle between Labastida and Fox is
being waged, strongly colored the news to benefit the PRI
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases coverage of Fox's campaign faced suppression.
Josh Tuynman, the national editor of Mexico City's English-language
newspaper, The News, said he resigned last week in protest over
instructions from the pro-PRI publishers to play down any stories
about Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Castaneda, an adviser to Fox, ended his regular
commentaries on Televisa after news officials there said he should
not continue because he had publicly suggested that they might
release inaccurate polls on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's campaign has galvanized a diverse range of Mexicans who
want what they refer to, with near-religious fervor, as ``the
change,'' an end to the PRI rule. His followers' vigor showed at
the huge rally that Fox held last weekend in that same vast plaza
in downtown Mexico City. His campaign slogan is a simple ``Now!''
describing the time when his voters want to be finished with the
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has made problems for himself. He raised doubts about
his qualities as a statesman with a show of stubbornness in a
discussion with the two other leading candidates on live television
in May, a day his supporters call ``Black Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably his most serious error was his failure to lure more
support from Cardenas, who opposes the PRI from the left. Fox grew
impatient with Cardenas' resistance to his overtures and has lashed
him a number of times with his country-talking tongue, making it
more difficult for Cardenas' voters to cross over.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, in his own teeming closing rally in the Mexico City
square last Sunday, echoed the PRI's accusations about Fox's
campaign finances and called him a liar and an ``electoral
delinquent.'' He said hardly an unkind word about Labastida.

 YOU CAN DUCK, BUT YOU CAN'T FLY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Chuck Quackenbush is stepping down in order to
avoid testifying.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to be verrry careful when he steps down, because that's
a very squishy mountain of bull doo he's stepping down from.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush will avoid any potentially unpleasant scolding from
our state's legislators by copping the traditional playground
basketball mea culpa plea of ``My bad.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Quackenbush has vowed to ``devote the rest of my
life to finding the real cheaters.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is a severe blow to Quackenbush's political career.
With the systematic lying and cheating now on his record, the only
job he has a chance of landing is president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting glimpse into politics. So far, the only
person who has been reprimanded or accused of a crime is
whistle-blower Cindy Ossias, who will probably lose her job because
she was the only honest, honorable and courageous person in the
insurance commissioner's office. Take a lesson, kids.
</P>
<P>
   Since insurance companies could have been fined up to $3 billion
for screwing earthquake victims, and Quacky let 'em off the hook
for $12 million, they paid 1/250th of what they should have paid.
That's a quarter of a cent on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   How could Quackenbush afford to give such great discounts?
Volume, volume, volume.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S OFFICIAL: Everyone who reads this paper is aware that when
hatters went mad, it was due to mercury poisoning, not inhalation
of glue fumes, as I first wrote, nor lead poisoning, as
subsequently stated here.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this is a rare correction correction, and it can be fun and
educational for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Hatters (they make men's hats; milliners make women's hats)
rubbed mercury into the felt hats to aid in the shaping and
finishing. Inhalation of the mercury fumes, and mercury absorption
through the skin of the hands, eventually led to loss of motor
control, drooling, severe twitching and other bad stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hayward says that if you were to drink a shot of mercury
and stand still for a while, the stuff would come out the bottoms
of your feet. That trick will either kill you or get you a great
laugh at a party, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   WHY BIG STARS never starve to death:
</P>
<P>
   About 9 p.m. last Saturday, the restaurant 23 Ross Common in
Ross got a call. Table for eight? Sorry, can't do it? Oh, it's for
Sean Penn and friends? Come on in.
</P>
<P>
   So Penn (a ``23'' regular), Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey,
producer Peter Allen and four others took over a corner of the
restaurant and stayed 'til way past closing time.
</P>
<P>
   They ate everything chef-owner Bob Montuori knows how to cook,
and when the other customers had gone, they broke out cigars and
port. Nicholson picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   The big scoop: According to one of the group, the big four are
``working on a project together.''
</P>
<P>
   WHILE SLAVING away on a Stairmaster at the gym, Barbara Weiss
glanced at the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean Claude Van Damme was rolling around with a bad guy who
was clutching a hypodermic syringe. The closed caption read,
`Yelling and strunting.' Do you know what that means?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, that's what I'm doing after five minutes on the
Stairmaster.
</P>
<P>
   I understand Van Damme does all his own strunts.
</P>
<P>
   YET ANOTHER true-life, TV-related adventure:
</P>
<P>
   Jessie Gordon was doing a crossword while watching TV when a
mouse ran to the middle of the living room rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if I scared him, he'd run away and show me where he
got in. I threw my pen at him _ and knocked him out cold!
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran and got an empty coffee can and piece of cardboard, and
as I was dumping him outside, he looked around as if to say, `What
the hey?' Now I know how he got out, but not how he got in.''
</P>
<P>
   And you named the mouse Steve Young, right?
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, I phoned Young the other day to tell him how
gracefully I thought he handled his going-away ceremonies. And
Steve commented, ``I retired from  &UR; what? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   FANS RIOTED in Los Angeles when the Lakers won the NBA title,
and officials expressed concern over the LAPD's ability to handle
riots at the upcoming Democratic national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Day wonders, ``Why are they worried about riots? The
Democrats are nominating Al Gore, for God's sake. Who's going to
riot over that? The Cardboard People from Planet Corrugated, where
Gore is a deity?''
</P>
<P>
   Your point is duly noted, Terry, but police presence will be
vital at the convention. Cops will drive around with lights
flashing and sirens blaring, trying to keep people awake.
</P>
<P>
   THE DREADED glassy-winged sharpshooter is invading Northern
California, threatening the wine industry.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of financial devastation, this is the most dangerous
insect to hit the state since the classy-wingtipped sharpdresser,
more commonly known as Chuck Quackenbush.

SHAW AGREES TO REST WEARY ARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the next few weeks, and probably a few weeks
after that, there won't be any debate whether Jeff Shaw will close
games for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who's struggled with control the last month, was placed on
the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his right elbow. The
move is retroactive to Tuesday, making Shaw eligible to return
after the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, right-hander Mike Fetters will get most of the
closer's work as long as he's able. With his team having a recent
history of arm problems, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson wants to
avoid using Fetters on back-to-back nights.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said he felt tightness in his elbow after pitching through
two rain delays Friday in St. Louis. He wrestled with the decision
to go on the disabled list for the first time in his career after
undergoing an MRI and EMG on Tuesday, finally deciding the rest
would do him well.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jamie Arnold, who was 2-4 with a 5.08 ERA last
season with the Dodgers, was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to
take Shaw's spot on the roster. He'll pitch in middle relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same thing I had in Montreal and I pitched through
it,'' said Shaw, who saved 124 games the last three years but is
2-4 with an 8.00 ERA this season. ``(Team physician Dr. Frank Jobe)
said you could pitch with it, but it's not going to get any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Shaw had to agree to go on the disabled list. But
with his doing so, the Dodgers got what they wanted _ Shaw resting.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was bothered by weakness in his right shoulder earlier this
month, but he said this isn't related. Once Shaw returns, he's
expecting to have to earn the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think with getting healthy and knowing he's healthy,
hopefully then he'll be the guy he was last year,'' Johnson said.
``(Arnold) can throw three innings, and as strong as he is, he can
come back and throw again the next day. He's a (Matt)
Herges-type.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Waiting on Orel: Because the Dodgers didn't request waivers
on veteran right-hander Orel Hershiser for the purpose of giving
his release until after business hours Tuesday, the waiver process
won't end until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Hershiser will face the decision about what to do
about his career. Many Dodgers officials, including managing
general partner and CEO Bob Daly, advised Hershiser to retire
instead of pitching with another team.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the situation said they thought Hershiser, if
claimed off waivers and presented with the right opportunity, would
continue to pitch. They said it was unlikely Hershiser would pitch
for a team not involved in a playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Right-hander Gregg Olson threw a simulated
game and, providing he's in no pain today or Friday, will begin a
rehab assignment Saturday in Class A San Bernardino. Johnson said
Olson is aiming to return after the All-Star break. . . . Catcher
Chad Kreuter's third-inning stolen base was the fourth of his
13-year career and first since 1998.

ANALYSIS: REACTIONS TO ABORTION RULING REFLECT POLITICAL
STRATEGIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 2nd, 16th grafs to clarify)  
(With SCOTUS-ABORTION) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The strikingly different reactions to the Supreme
Court's ruling on abortion Wednesday underscore how Vice President
Al Gore is trying mightily to catapult the court into a
front-and-center issue in the presidential campaign, while Gov.
George W. Bush wants the matter to fade from the political horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the court announced its 5-4 decision striking down
Nebras- ka's ban on the type of abortion that opponents call
partial-birth abortion, Gore upended a planned talk in Blacklick,
Ohio, about the environment and energy, and instead opened his
remarks by warning that the unexpected closeness of the vote
demonstrated the importance of electing a president who would pick
justices who would protect abortion rights. He said nothing about
the late-term abortion procedure addressed by the court.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush made no mention of the broader makeup of the
court, though he did upbraid the justices for not upholding the
right to ban what he called ``the brutal practice'' of late-term
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting strategies _ and remarks from the two rivals _
reflect differing political imperatives. The Bush strategy is to
make the abortion issue go away, and, for his campaign, the timing
of Wednesday's ruling is not propitious. The last thing the
Republicans want one month before their nominating convention is
another spectacle that turns rancorous over abortion. Not only
that, the ruling comes as Bush is mulling over whether he dares
pick a running mate who favors abortion rights and how he can
finesse the issue in the party platform.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore wants to do whatever he can to keep the matter alive _
and paint Republicans as riven by internecine squabbles over
abortion. Gore officials have been waiting gleefully for months in
anticipation of Wednesday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst news that the Bush campaign could get,''
said Ann Stone, national chairwoman of the Republicans For Choice
PAC. The closeness of the court ruling, she said, gave Gore a fresh
hook to declare that abortion rights may be endangered, and to
shore up his sagging support from women.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Bond, the former Republican Party chairman who for
years has counseled the party to not let itself split over
abortion, said the best thing Bush could do was to keep a low
profile on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll try to paint Bush as risky, extremist, out of touch,
intolerant,'' Bond said of Democrats. ``I don't think Bush is going
to take the bait on this. What can a presidential candidate do
about a Supreme Court decision?''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Gore put out fresh bait. He seized on the ruling _
and another that gives states greater leeway to restrict
anti-abortion demonstrations outside health clinics _ and tried to
reignite the abortion issue in the Republican Party. For months, in
speech after speech, Gore has warned that religious conservatives
like Patrick Buchanan and Jerry Falwell would ratify prospects for
the bench if Bush is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Wednesday: ``The next president will nominate at least
three and probably four, perhaps four, justices to the Supreme
Court. One extra vote on the wrong side of those two issues would
change the outcome and a woman's right to choose would be taken
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Gore recalled that Bush has said he respects
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, both of whom were
dissenters in the decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Air Force II on Wednesday night on a flight from Columbus,
Ohio, to New York, Gore stepped up his attack, asserting that Bush
was determined to overturn Roe vs. Wade, which affirms a woman's
right to an abortion. ``His views about choice are really quite
extreme,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was also on script, asserting at a news
conference here that the court's stand on abortion was ``very much
in the balance, depending on what appointments are made in the next
four years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no surprise that Bush, in his remarks, failed to mention
the prospect of vacancies on the Supreme Court. While conservative
groups have trumpeted the balance of the court as a high-stakes
voting issue, Bush almost never raises it on the stump. He does not
want to put off moderate and swing voters who may support abortion
rights. He also knows, perhaps, that usually only the most partisan
voters think about the makeup of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush told supporters in Cleveland, ``I hope to be able
to come up with a law that meets the constitutional scrutiny. And,
unlike Al Gore, I pledge to fight for a ban on partial birth
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling is discouraging for Bush and many Republicans
not only because it gives Gore another rationale to talk about the
court. In addition, the Republicans' embrace in the last few years
of eliminating late-term abortion allowed the party to maintain its
anti-abortion position in a way that is more palatable to many
voters than suggesting overturning the Supreme Court's
constitutional rationale allowing abortion. Even many Democrats who
favor abortion rights tell pollsters they object to late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But with Wednesday's decision, it may be difficult for
politicians like Rep. Rick Lazio, a Republican who is running for
the U.S. Senate from New York, to declare that he favors abortion
rights but voted to prohibit some late-term abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will no longer be credible for politicians to claim to be
pro-choice while supporting these abortion bans,'' said Janet
Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy,
which represented the doctor in the Nebraska case.
</P>
<P>
   Another complication is that some Republicans have already begun
debating whether they should keep language in the party platform
that applauds efforts ``to sign into law an end to partial birth
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to energizing Democrats, Wednesday's ruling may
embolden conservatives, some of whom want Bush, like Gore, to turn
it into a rallying cry to discuss the court itself. But in their
determination that Bush capture the White House, they are reluctant
to press him to be outspoken on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like him to aggressively criticize the decision and to
say how important it is that we have judges who respect innocent
human life,'' said Phyllis Schlafly, the prominent anti-abortion
advocate. Asked if Bush should raise the abortion issue more, she
said, ``I don't know that he has to make it the first thing he
talks about at every stop. There's so much to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves of Kansas put it this way: ``Many Republicans
are prepared to put aside differences on abortion and other issues
in exchange for the greater good _ the election of George Bush as
president.''

 CLINTON USES BULLY PULPIT TO EXTOL GORE AT PRESS CONFERENCE  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, with just over half a year
remaining in his own presidency, spent the better part of an
hourlong news conference Wednesday advancing Vice President Al
Gore's bid to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton dismissed Gore's sagging poll numbers, defended him
against allegations of campaign finance wrongdoing and insisted
that the vice president's association with the ``bogus'' scandals
of his own administration will do him no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still more likely than not that he will win,'' Clinton
said in response to repeated inquiries about Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference in the White House East Room was Clinton's
first in three months and covered a range of topics from relations
with Cuba to the high price of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he supports the concept behind a GOP bill to lift a
trade embargo on food and medicine sales to Cuba, but rejected the
suggestion of normalizing relations with the Caribbean republic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he supports trade with regimes in China, North Korea
and Russia, yet not Cuba, Clinton angrily recalled the downing of
two planes belonging to an anti-Castro group over Cuba in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of these other countries you mentioned, none of them _ none of
them _ by order of the leader of the country killed, murdered ...
two airplanes worth of people,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was lukewarm to the suggestion that the federal
government repeal an 18-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to compensate
for soaring prices, saying that to do so, congressional leaders
would have to decide what highway projects they would be willing to
do without.
</P>
<P>
   With just a few months left before Congress adjourns for the
year, Clinton urged passage of his own legislative priorities,
including a patients' bill of rights, a $2 an hour minimum wage
increase, gun control laws, hate crime legislation and more money
for schools.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of his own dwindling presence in the national
political spotlight, the reporters kept returning to questions
about the campaign between Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to doubts often expressed by Democrats about Bush's
intellect, one questioner asked Clinton how important ``command of
facts and plain old brain power'' are to the job of being
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a dead-bang loser, isn't it,'' Clinton said with a
laugh. ``No matter what I say, I'm in a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton passed on the opportunity to knock Bush, saying: ``I
don't think it's so much a question of intelligence, generically.
... I think it's much more a question of curiosity and willingness
to learn what you think is important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared confident and relaxed for most of the midday
event, however he grew defensive when someone asked whether Gore's
slip in the polls might in part stem from his association with the
administration's scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me remind you that a lot of these ... so-called scandals
were bogus,'' Clinton said, specifically mentioning the charges
against Mike Espy, the former secretary of Agriculture, and Henry
Cisneros, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you all know that the Whitewater thing was bogus from day
one,'' he added pointedly. ``So the word `scandal' has been thrown
around here like a clanging teapot for seven years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no mention of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, which
led to Clinton's impeachment in 1998. No reporters brought it up.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Gore did the right thing last week in releasing the
123-page transcript of his testimony with Justice Department
attorneys regarding Democratic Party fund raising in 1996 and
expressed doubt that a special prosecutor is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Lavishing praise on the vice president, Clinton said ``no person
in the history of the republic has ever had the positive impact on
this country as vice president than Al Gore has had.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recounted the difficulties that previous vice
presidents, including Richard Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in
1968, and George Bush in 1988, had emerging from the shadow of the
president. But he said that after this summer's political
conventions, Gore and Bush will emerge as the ``main players on the
stage of American political life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon and Humphrey each lost their elections.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has made any decisions about what to do after he
leaves the White House in January, Clinton said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll run for the school board someday,'' Clinton said.
``That's about the only thing I can imagine doing. I don't have any
other plans. I just want to be a good citizen.''

 CALIFORNIA INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RESIGNS UNDER PRESSURE  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush resigned
Wednesday to avoid testifying under oath about using money from
insurance company settlements for his own political activities.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush did not receive any deals in exchange for his
resignation _ which is effective July 10 _ and a criminal and civil
probe by the Attorney General is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either through intention or neglect, the Department of
Insurance committed unacceptable abuses of power during Mr.
Quackenbush's tenure as commissioner,'' said Assemblyman Jack
Scott, D-Pasadena, chairman of the Assembly Insurance Committee.
``I take no joy in the ruin of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's capitulation ended a months-long legislative
investigation into the activities of his department.
</P>
<P>
   Hearings conducted by the Assembly Insurance Committee revealed
that Quackenbush coerced insurance companies into paying $12
million to nonprofit foundations he created. The payments allegedly
allowed the insurers to avoid paying as much as $3.7 billion in
fines for improperly handling policyholders' claims after the 1994
Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The payments to the foundations were used to promote the
Republican commissioner's own political agenda, and none of the
money went to earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, 46, was one of only two statewide-elected
Republicans, and his demise is a blow to the GOP's prospects in
future state elections.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a letter announcing his resignation to Secretary of
State Bill Jones _ the other statewide-elected Republican _ shortly
after noon Wednesday. The letter said simply, ``I hereby resign my
position as insurance commissioner of the state of California
effective July 10, 2000.'' He left his lawyer's office without
commenting to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis has the authority to appoint a successor, who
will then need to be confirmed by both houses of the Legislature.
That individual will serve out Quackenbush's term, which ends in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   Davis released a statement promising to ``name someone of
unquestioned integrity, with the ability and experience to restore
credibility to this important office.``
</P>
<P>
   Still pending is Attorney General Bill Lockyer's criminal and
civil probe of the operations of the department and foundations
Quackenbush established.
</P>
<P>
   ``No deal was offered by my office to Mr. Quackenbush, and none
is contemplated,'' Lockyer said. ``Our investigation of the
Northridge insurance settlements and related Department of
Insurance actions will continue without delay. If crimes have been
committed by anyone associated with these actions, my office will
take action to see to it that they are prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento County district attorney's office is also
investigating the matter, and the Fair Political Practices
Commission may investigate Quackenbush's use of campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer has shut down one of the earthquake foundations and
frozen its assets. The civil lawsuit filed against Quackenbush on
behalf of taxpayers demands the return of the money diverted from
the general fund and into the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the victims of the earthquake will ever see restitution
for their claims is unclear. There is a movement in the Legislature
to reopen all claims, but how any payments might be made has not
been determined. Quackenbush's lawyer said Wednesday that the
commissioner did not do anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done nothing criminal or illegal,'' said Donald Heller, a
prominent Sacramento defense attorney. ``Mistakes were made, as he
fully admitted. But he felt that in light of the level of this
controversy and the paralyzing effect it has had on the Department
of Insurance, he was left with no choice but to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's resignation came two days after a senior
department official testified that he was told to make a $4 million
settlement with a title insurance company because the commissioner
``needed $4 million for a media buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, Robert Hagedorn, said he was told by two members
of Quackenbush's executive staff that the insurance chief made the
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Insurance Committee then told the two staffers _
Norris Clark and Brian Soublet _ that they would be given immunity
and forced to testify, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Both men confirmed to the committee that they were in the room
when Quackenbush made the statement in March and would have
testified to the fact before Quackenbush took the stand Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As these facts became known, Republicans in the Legislature told
Quackenbush that resignation was the only way to avoid impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Assembly Republican leader Scott Baugh of Huntington
Beach told state Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, that he heard
Quackenbush would plead the Fifth Amendment to avoid
self-incrimination in Thursday's planned testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If Quackenbush did so, Baugh told Brulte that GOP Assembly
members would move to impeach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something this egregious happens on your watch, you can't
walk away from it unsullied,'' said Republican Assemblyman Ken
Maddox of Garden Grove, the vice chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Grounds for Impeachment
</P>
<P>
   Because Quackenbush had previously denied any knowledge of the
foundations' operations, admitting now that he had any knowledge
would also have been grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Brulte met with Heller and said that if Quackenbush
was considering resigning, he should do so before the Assembly's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Heller said Wednesday the comments Quackenbush made about
needing the money for a media buy were not what they seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That testimony was correct as to what was said, but there was
a far greater context,'' Heller said. ``It is consistent with what
he has said in the past about seeking to do outreach to underserved
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller said Quackenbush never planned to take the Fifth
Amendment. He also said the commissioner plans to cooperate with
Lockyer in any way he can.
</P>
<P>
   The July 10 resignation date was chosen to allow Quackenbush
some time to finish up some business, some of which would not be
able to be accomplished over the holiday weekend, Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   Many hope to see a successor named quickly, because one of
Quackenbush's top aides _ Michael Kelley _ would be left in charge
once he is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our hearings, I have no confidence in him,'' Keeley
said. Speculation on possible appointments by the governor began in
earnest Wednesday. Some thought Davis would not want another
elected official to be given such a prominent spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This governor would be more likely to appoint a caretaker than
an elected official,'' said one lawmaker who asked for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   One Capitol insider said, ``The governor probably does not want
competition for insurance industry campaign contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other names have surfaced as possible appointments to
the post.
</P>
<P>
   One is U.S. Rep. Gary Condit, D-Ceres, who is close to Davis and
has created a state political action committee for a possible run
at statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Another is state Sen. Patrick Johnston, a moderate Stockton
Democrat with nearly 20 years of legislative experience on a
variety of insurance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston is leaving the Legislature in December because of term
limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the governor asked, I'd be honored to serve,'' Johnston
said. ``In the little world of the Capitol, the names people think
of are people that work here, but it's a big state.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, has previously
expressed interest in the job, but Wednesday said she didn't know
if she wanted the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know the job I will do is work to reform the department
through the Legislature, and I really haven't thought much farther
than that,'' said Speier, chairwoman of the Senate Insurance
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee intends to hold more hearings,'' she said.
``We're going to transform that department into one of the best in
the nation as it relates to consumer protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Assembly Insurance Committee also promised that
reform would take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merely changing the occupant of the office is not enough if
there are structural conflicts of interest inherent in the
office,'' said Assemblyman Tom McClintock, R-Northridge. ``There is
a need for substantial institutional reforms.''

LAKERS WAIVE GOODBY TO A.C., DRAFT MADSEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Just nine days removed from the glow of
their championship moment, the Los Angeles Lakers began the
retooling process Wednesday with two promising additions and one
painful subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   The net result: The only player to contribute to the Lakers'
last three championships probably won't be around for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green, who started every regular-season and playoff game at
power forward last season, was waived just hours before the NBA
draft. The Lakers then selected his potential replacement, drafting
Stanford big man Mark Madsen with the 29th pick.
</P>
<P>
   They also acquired swingman Cory Hightower, the 54th overall
pick, in a trade with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to cut ties with Green _ who left the Lakers
after winning two titles in the 1980s, then returned last season
and helped restore ``Showtime'' _ made the biggest waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions like this are most difficult, particularly when you
have the utmost respect for a true professional like A.C. Green,''
said Lakers executive Jerry West, who added that moves like this
are ``what I most despise about this part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was not unexpected. Green will be 37 in October and was
due to make $1.9 million next season if the Lakers did not cut him
by Saturday. Releasing Green will save money and give the Lakers
room to sign a younger, more athletic power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Their payroll also is perilously close to the $55 million
threshold that will trigger the league's luxury tax in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something we felt we had to do in order to remain more
flexible going forward, also knowing that we're going to be facing
a potential tax,'' West said. ``And as I stated before, our job is
one of trying to assemble a team that not only can be competitive
on the court but also stay within the guidelines of what our owner
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Green was traveling and unavailable for comment, but agent Marc
Fleisher said Green understood the decision. Green does not intend
to retire, and both Fleisher and Laker officials suggested he could
even return to the Lakers, albeit for less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very loyal to the Lakers,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Green averaged 5.9 rebounds in the regular season but slipped to
3.3 rebounds in the playoffs and surrendered most of his minutes to
Robert Horry. Green and Horry were an adequate tag team, but the
Lakers were hurt in the playoffs by more athletic forwards, from
Sacramento's Chris Webber to Portland's Rasheed Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to find the answer in the free-agent market, using
their $2.25 million salary-cap exception. Last summer they
unsuccessfully dangled the exception in front of Charles Oakley and
Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get a very attractive player as a free agent
with our midrange exception,'' West said. ``If not, we can always
go back to A.C. Green and see if there's some interest on his part
coming back here. But my best guess is we're going to look for help
in the free-agency market.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who they get, the Lakers hope to see an immediate
contribution from the 6-foot-9, 240-pound Madsen, who played four
years for the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about having this guy,'' West said. ``He's a
tough, hard-nosed kid. I think he has an opportunity to play right
away. . . . And my best guess is he will be a tremendous crowd
favorite here. This guy plays really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen averaged 12.2 points and 9.4 rebounds as a senior. His
nickname, ``Mad Dog,'' says everything else _ he's aggressive and
physical, attributes the Lakers sorely need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need physical players in basketball,'' coach Phil Jackson
said, ``and you need players that are willing to put their body on
the line, to take charges, to plug the lane, to do other things
that are important for a ballclub to keep the opponents away from
penetration. And that's one of the things I think this young man
has demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has to play within the framework of how we play as a
team, and how his enthusiasm ignites us or brings us to that level
is important.''
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm was evident in a brief conference call with
reporters. Madsen, a lifelong Lakers fan, put an exclamation point
at the end of every sentence and said he ``jumped about 10 feet in
the air'' when the Lakers picked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited I am right now to be joining such
a first-class organization,'' said Madsen, whose grandparents live
in Long Beach. ``I love Southern California, I love the area, and I
absolutely love the Lakers. I grew up watching the Lakers and I
just think the world of coach Phil Jackson _ I've read his books
and I'm just so excited to be joining the Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers did not have a second-round pick but obtained
Hightower _ who played two years at Indian Hills City College in
Iowa _ from the Spurs in exchange for second-round picks in 2001
and 2002.

STANDARD-BEARER FIGHTS TO PRESERVE PRI POWER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ To understand why Francisco Labastida may soon
rule Mexico, one has to understand what he is not.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a rabble-rousing populist, and he's not an Ivy
League-educated technocrat. He's not corrupt (at least as far as
anyone seems to know); he is not a member of any of the governing
party's quarreling factions, and he's not an enemy of anyone in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, he has been chosen by the world's most
long-lasting political machine, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), to be its leader.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's national elections, if the public opinion polls are
correct, he could eke out a razor-thin victory to become Mexico's
next president.
</P>
<P>
   He is the man of the machine. To tens of millions of Mexicans,
that is reason to vote for him _ or against him.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Graciela Urroz and her co-workers at a Labastida rally
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI knows how,'' Urroz said. ``It has the experience, it
helps the average people get ahead. That's why most people support
him, er, whatshisname?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida,'' a friend chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida, right, I trust him. He's the best candidate by
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Urroz and her companions are government workers from Mexico
state, just outside the capital city. They had been bused to a
recent PRI rally in Mexico City's central Zocalo square by their
union, which is tightly linked to the PRI and has turned out its
members to vote for the party since before most of its current
members were born.
</P>
<P>
   But squeeze your way 10 yards through the tightly packed crowd
in the Zocalo and ask the guy selling chewing gum about Labastida.
He grins and hisses, ``I'm just working here. I'm not one of these
 &UR; acarreados. &LR; '' The slang word, used only by PRI opponents, is
loosely translatable as ``trucked-in-ones,'' or ``rent-a-crowd.''
It refers to the PRI's practice of coercing vast numbers of people,
ranging from government workers and union members to peasants, to
attend its rallies and vote for its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A special congressional commission has filed dozens of
complaints with Mexico's attorney general, charging that the PRI is
illegally using federal programs to gain support and is turning
some government workplaces into virtual campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Independent election monitors say Labastida's recent rise in the
polls _ he was behind in some surveys until a month ago and is now
ahead by a few percentage points in most _ is due to the PRI's
reliance on such coercive measures.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mexico City rally, Labastida rushed through a short
speech emphasizing that the PRI, and only the PRI, could guarantee
``change with direction'' _ controlled, cautious change rather than
the destabilizing lurches that he said would take place under
opposition rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we all go forward, correcting what hasn't worked and
making changes with direction so that people live better, or we'll
all go backward. I have no doubt. Never backward, no way, never,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's voice, a reedy tenor, excited almost no one in the
crowd, but it did the trick. Although Mexican intellectuals and
political analysts _ most of whom openly or covertly support his
opponents _ disparage him as a wooden campaigner lacking in
charisma, Labastida has been effective on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches are carefully crafted for audiences ranging from
Mexico City bankers to Oaxaca Indians to Veracruz oil workers, and
they carry a sense of competence and earnestness.
</P>
<P>
   In smaller, more informal settings, Labastida can be even more
engaging and impressive. Drawing on his background as a lifelong
bureaucrat and politician _ a government economist, governor of
Sinaloa state and Cabinet minister in charge of the Agriculture,
Energy and Interior departments _ he can switch topics
extemporaneously from child nutrition to farm supports to oil
exploration, mixing minute details with broad rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   As a man of the PRI system, he is frequently savaged by
opponents as yesterday's hack. ``Labastida represents the worst of
the official party system, a network of corruption, repression and
arrogance,'' said leftist challenger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in a
typical attack.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas and other critics say Labastida's background shows
little evidence that he would carry out bold reforms as president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during his 1998-99 stint as Interior secretary, a
position that directs the government's powerful systems of
patronage and political and police control, his accomplishments
were gradual and piecemeal. His pressure for clean voting produced
local elections free of major claims of fraud, but he failed to
solve the standoff in the southern state of Chiapas, where
Zapatista guerrillas have been holed up in the jungle since their
1994 rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point out that drug violence, including car
bombings and assassinations, intensified in Sinaloa state during
his 1987-92 tenure as governor. But Labastida contends that not
only did he fight the drug traffickers, they even shot up his car
and tried to kill him. Because he had received death threats, the
PRI named him ambassador to Portugal when his term as governor was
over to get him out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida and his advisers have read enough polls to realize
that after 71 years of often-corrupt, authoritarian PRI rule, most
Mexicans want change. Some of the advice has come from U.S.
campaign strategists such as James Carville, President Clinton's
former adviser, whom the PRI hired to help poll voters and shape
political messages.
</P>
<P>
   Like Democrats in the United States, Labastida has focused on
the issue of education, saying he will lengthen the grade school
day by two hours daily and raise teachers' salaries. Taking a page
out of Cardenas' campaign manual, Labastida has constantly
criticized President Ernesto Zedillo's free-market, free-trade
policies, saying he would concentrate on supporting domestic
industries rather than exports.
</P>
<P>
   If much of this agenda echoes the old, nationalist PRI,
umbilically linked to government largesse and power, Labastida is
eager to reinforce the impression. While the reform-oriented
Zedillo repeatedly has advocated a ``healthy distance'' between the
party and the presidency, Labastida calls for a ``healthy
nearness.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, this sort of rhetorical ``change'' seems to play
well. ``Whatever he says, I love it,'' Urroz said as the Mexico
City rally broke up. ``It's what we need.''

TIGERS MAUL YANKEES, 13-6 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ If their names were not Jeter, Cone, O'Neill, Williams
and Torre, no one would take them seriously anymore. If not for all
their World Series rings, they would be written off as contenders.
</P>
<P>
   This is what would be said about the New York Yankees, if not
for the pedigree: their pitching is terrible. They cannot catch the
ball. Their offense is sterile. This is what would be said about
the Yankees: they stink.
</P>
<P>
   They have the big names, however, the rings, the pedigrees and,
even after games like Wednesday night's, in which Detroit crushed
four homers among eight extra-base hits and destroyed the Yankees,
13-6, you figure that it is only a matter of time before they
rebound and at least play adequately. But with each successive
defeat, they are moving closer to being defined by this prolonged
slump.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ford made his fourth professional start for the Yankees on
Wednesday night and lasted only two batters into the third inning,
and by then the score was one-sided, another game lost. The Yankees
have dropped 26 of their last 41 games, and are three games out of
first place in the American League East, behind the Toronto Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is a rookie. Andy Pettitte will start Thursday on only
three days' rest, and the Yankees do not know who will pitch Friday
_ they are hoping Jason Grimsley can step in as an emergency
starter _ or on Saturday or Sunday; maybe Orlando Hernandez and
Roger Clemens, or maybe not. Ramiro Mendoza will miss at least two
more weeks, and David Cone is healthy but he has not won since
April 28.
</P>
<P>
   This is the state of the Yankees' pitching staff. In the 40
games leading to Wednesday night's defeat, the Yankee pitchers
allowed 378 hits and 160 walks in their last 3502/3 innings, an
average of 1.53 runners an inning. They accumulated a 5.03 earned
run average.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers got much worse Wednesday night. Detroit's Tony
Clark lined a two-run double in the first inning. Brad Ausmus
tripled to right field to lead off the second, and manager Joe
Torre elected to position the infield in, in an attempt to pinch
off the run.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the Yankees played their infield back with a
runner at third in the 11th inning, and as a result, the winning
run scored on a soft grounder hit to shortstop. But with the
infield in Wednesday night, Juan Encarnacion dumped a blooper over
second, the ball falling between second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and
right fielder Paul O'Neill. Ausmus scored, and O'Neill, disgusted,
threw the ball into the ground furiously.
</P>
<P>
   Two more runs scored in that inning. The Yankees trailed by 5-0,
their frustration was heightened and, really, the best they could
hope for at that point was that Ford could get back on track and
pitch a few more innings and save the bullpen from early abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford did not do this. Clark smashed a home run to open the
third inning, and after Ford walked Dean Palmer, Allen Watson was
summoned from the bullpen. The left-handed Watson was crucial to
the Yankees last season, after being acquired in July, but this
year he has struggled. He walked Ausmus with one out before
Encarnacion launched a three-run homer, and after Deivi Cruz's
single, Luis Polonia lined a home run into the bullpen in right
field.  &QL;

 METS WIN 7th STRAIGHT GAME AS ROCKER AND BRAVES LOOM  
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The purpose of the roof that went up over the bench
in the visitors' bullpen at Shea Stadium on Wednesday night was not
to protect the Florida Marlins relievers. It is a Rocker Roof, and
when the New York Mets are host to the Atlanta Braves on Thursday
night, it will shield the notorious John Rocker from harm.
</P>
<P>
   Before that happens, though, the Mets had one more meeting with
the Marlins prior to their four-game showdown with the Braves, who
hold a two-game lead over them in the National League East. And so
the first reliever to emerge from the left-field fortress Wednesday
night was Ricky Bones; the Mets should not expect Atlanta's
relievers to be so generous.
</P>
<P>
   Called in with the bases loaded and his team holding a two-run
lead in the sixth inning, Bones could not halt a sudden outbreak of
wildness and sloppy play that helped the Mets earn their seventh
victory in a row, 6-5, before a crowd of 37,252.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Penny, the Florida starter, had walked three of his last
four hitters, the last walk forcing in a run, when Bones was
summoned. But Bones walked Derek Bell to bring in a run, and then
got Mike Piazza to ground toward the hole between short and third.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Andy Fox could not field the ball, and the Mets tied
the score at 4-4 on the error. Mark Johnson then lashed a two-run
single to left that gave the Mets a 6-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose two-run homer was a crucial blow in Monday's
victory over the Marlins, was making his first start since being
recalled from Triple-A Norfolk. He was a late addition to the
lineup, starting because of lingering soreness in the right
shoulder of third baseman Robin Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who injured the shoulder diving for a ball on Sunday,
acknowledged the soreness before the game but said it was unrelated
to off-season surgery. Ventura walked as a pinch-hitter in the
sixth inning and was replaced by a pinch-runner, pitcher Mike
Hampton. Venture is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura was resting because of injury, but two healthy Mets
regulars did not start.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, when Manager Bobby Valentine met with reporters
and was asked about the Braves, he seemed bemused. The Marlins were
Wednesday night's opponent, he said. Protestations aside,
Valentine's lineup was obviously more fit for fourth-place Florida
than first-place Atlanta. Edgardo Alfonzo and Todd Zeile were out
of the lineup for routine days off.
</P>
<P>
   Either one could have been used in the fourth inning, when the
Mets had the bases loaded and one out and Valentine let his
starter, Bobby J. Jones, hit for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jones struck out, and then the leadoff hitter, Melvin Mora,
grounded into a force-out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets trailed by 3-1 at that point because of a bases-empty
home run by Cliff Floyd and a two-run shot by Mike Lowell.
Florida's first hitter in the fifth, Paul Bako, stroked a double
and scored on a single by Luis Castillo, increasing the Marlins'
lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was coming off his best start of the season, an
eight-inning, one-run victory over Pittsburgh. He allowed four runs
on seven hits in six innings Wednesday night, but evened his record
at 3-3 when the Mets broke out for five runs in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Penny struck out the first two hitters in the sixth, but he
walked Benny Agbayani and allowed a single to Kurt Abbott. Ventura
then walked, and Mora's walk brought the Mets within 4-2, before
Bones entered, and the Mets went ahead for good.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins provided a scare in the seventh, when Preston Wilson
laced a two-out, run-scoring single off Dennis Cook to cut the
Mets' lead to 6-5. Pat Mahomes relieved Cook _ who tossed a towel,
shook his head and muttered to himself on the bench but escaped the
jam by getting Lowell to fly out.

MAVERICK CHALLENGES MEXICO'S LONGTIME RULING PARTY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUANAJUATO, Mexico _ Late last year, when Vicente Fox needed to
hire a manager for his presidential campaign, he did something
shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with age-old Mexican political tradition, he didn't
fill the position from among his top aides or longtime associates.
Nor did he pick one of his political party's experienced campaign
operatives. Instead, Fox, a former manager of Coca-Cola's Mexico
operations, went to a corporate headhunter.
</P>
<P>
   After dozens of interviews, he chose Pedro Cerisola, a top
executive for Telefonos de Mexico, the national phone company.
Cerisola had never met Fox, had no election background and was
completely unknown in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The result? By nearly all accounts, Fox's campaign has been
well-run and flexible, boosting Fox to his current position near
the top of most polls and at the top of at least one.
</P>
<P>
   All this, his backers say, is an example of what sort of
president Fox would be _ efficient and beholden to no one. After 71
years of political cronyism and corruption under the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), they argue, Mexico needs a new way of
doing things.
</P>
<P>
   But that also scares many people, for whom Fox remains
unpredictable, an opportunist who talks out of both sides of his
mouth. His opponents _ Francisco Labastida of the PRI and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of a left-of-center coalition _ lambaste him as
``arrogant,'' ``reactionary,'' and even as ``a traitor to the
motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign has functioned with a great deal of tolerance,
and that's why it makes others so nervous,'' Cerisola said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth of the matter, it's clear that Fox has been
able to create an unusual political alliance that includes more
than his party, the pro-Catholic, conservative National Action
Party (PAN), and the centrist Green Ecologist Party of Mexico,
which together have formed a coalition dubbed Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fox has sidelined the two parties' political apparatus,
surrounding himself with prominent left-of-center intellectuals _
like well-known writer Jorge Castaneda, a former Cardenas adviser _
and a few longtime aides. Wags say he is now more  &UR; Foxista  &LR; than
 &UR; PANista.  &LR; At times, his about-faces have been astonishing:
</P>
<P>
   -- He has abandoned his earlier proposals to privatize the
government oil and electrical monopolies, which are viewed by most
Mexicans as jewels of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   -- He has endorsed the so-called San Andres accords, which were
signed by a congressional panel and the Zapatista rebels in 1996
but have been blocked by President Ernesto Zedillo (and by
Labastida during his stint as Interior secretary). The accords
would give vast new rights to the downtrodden Indian groups that
make up about 10 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   -- He has pledged to name opposition officials to key Cabinet
ministries, such as Energy and Social Development, and to keep most
incumbent PRI bureaucrats in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   -- He has tacitly repudiated the PAN's conservative social
agenda. In virtually every speech, he embraces equality for women,
opposes religious education in public schools, opposes further
restrictions on abortion and supports gay rights. ``The Alliance
for Change is not against strip-teases, naked people, and even less
against the gay community,'' blared one of his coalition's recent
newspaper ads. ``The Alliance for Change is against lies, hypocrisy
and double standards. We are against those who throw rocks and then
hide their hand: cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political pundits throw up their hands in response. ``Fox
tries to be all things to all people,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a
prominent analyst and historian who supports Cardenas. ``He's all
over the map in a way that can only be called opportunist.''
</P>
<P>
   For clues to how Fox really would govern as president, many look
to his record as governor of Guanajuato state from 1996 to 1999.
The state, located about 150 miles northwest of Mexico City, is
chugging along in much the same way as other nearby PRI-run states:
Maquiladora assembly plants are spreading everywhere, unemployment
is dropping, social statistics are improving mildly, yet most
people are still struggling on low incomes.
</P>
<P>
   So was Fox's government really different from a PRI government?
Yes, but not too dramatically. His record includes the following:
</P>
<P>
   -- Fox's constant world travels to pitch Guanajuato as an
investment location paid off, bringing about $3 billion in new
industrial facilities. General Motors, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Celanese,
Reebok and Nestle built new plants, and unemployment dropped to 2.4
percent, the second-lowest rate in Mexico. He opened state offices,
or mini-embassies, in Hong Kong, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   -- He named several PRI leaders to top state positions. He also
allowed corrupt, conservative, PRI-run unions to keep their hammer
lock on the state's workers _ thus keeping factory wages low, a key
incentive for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   -- By increasing education spending and taking a tough stand
against the PRI-controlled teachers' union, he helped raise school
performance and graduation rates and lower adult illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   -- He helped Guanajuato emigrants in the United States bring
their savings back to start small factories in their hometowns. For
example, his government matched funds sent by Guanajuatans in Napa
County to set up a successful clothing plant in Timbinal in the
southern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   -- He provided thousands of computers for school classrooms and
spearheaded a joint program with Microsoft Corp. to train
university students in software development. Fox hopes the program
will turn Guanajuato into ``Silicon Valley South.''
</P>
<P>
   When describing this complex record, Fox's backers say that in
Mexico, where political dogma and intolerance are all too common,
it should simply be called pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox's agenda is ensuring the democratic transition from the
PRI, not enacting a partisan program,'' said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser,
a left-of-center, independent federal senator who is one of Fox's
top campaign advisers. ``His government will be a gradual process,
integrating many different points of view into consensus on the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But many backers and opponents alike say that if Fox is elected
president, his government would be severely divided between
centrist  &UR; Foxistas  &LR; and conservative  &UR; PANistas. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Fox's campaign team and the PAN there is very little
in common, and this could become very complicated once in
government,'' said Carlos Castilla Peraza, a longtime PAN leader.
``Would he try to govern without the party that put him in power?''

EXCERPTS FROM HUGH COURT OPINIONS ON NEBRASKA'S ABORTION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: please replace double parentheses (( )) with single
brackets)  
 (editors: excerpts from dissenting opinion in 2nd take) 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Supreme Court decision
overturning a Nebraska law dealing with abortion. The vote in the
case, Stenberg vs. Carhart, was 5-4. The majority opinion was
written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer; Justice Clarence Thomas wrote
the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Breyer
</P>
<P>
   We again consider the right to an abortion. We understand the
controversial nature of the problem. Millions of Americans believe
that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is
akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the
thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a
law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to
lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and
leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions
with the attendant risks of death and suffering. Taking account of
these virtually irreconcilable points of view, aware that
constitutional law must govern a society whose different members
sincerely hold directly opposing views, and considering the matter
in light of the Constitution's guarantees of fundamental individual
liberty, this Court, in the course of a generation, has determined
and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic protection
to the woman's right to choose. We shall not revisit those legal
principles. Rather, we apply them to the circumstances of this
case.
</P>
<P>
   Three established principles determine the issue before us. . .
. First, before ``viability the woman has a right to choose to
terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``a law designed to further the state's interest in
fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision
before fetal viability'' is unconstitutional. An ``undue burden is
shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the
purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of
a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``subsequent to viability, the state in promoting its
interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses,
regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is
necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of
the life or health of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   We apply these principles to a Nebraska law banning ``partial
birth abortion.'' The statute reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``No partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state,
unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother
whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness,
or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition
caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The question before us is whether Nebraska's statute, making
criminal the performance of a ``partial birth abortion,'' violates
the federal Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. vs. Casey, (1992), and Roe vs. Wade, (1973). We
conclude that it does for at least two independent reasons. First,
the law lacks any exception ``for the preservation of the health of
the mother.'' Second, it ``imposes an undue burden on a woman's
ability'' to choose a D ((short for ``dilation and evacuation,'' a
generic term for abortions performed at 13 weeks or later)). . . .
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Nebraska's law applies both pre- and postviability
aggravates the constitutional problem presented. The state's
interest in regulating abortion previability is considerably weaker
than postviability. Since the law requires a health exception in
order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a
minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The quoted standard also depends on the state regulations
``promoting ((the state's)) interest in the potentiality of human
life.'' The Nebraska law, of course, does not directly further an
interest ``in the potentiality of human life'' by saving the fetus
in question from destruction, as it regulates only a  &UR; method &LR;  of
performing abortion. Nebraska describes its interests differently.
It says the law ``shows concern for the life of the unborn,''
``prevents cruelty to partially born children,'' and ``preserves
the integrity of the medical profession.'' But we cannot see how
the interest-related differences could make any difference to the
question at hand, namely, the application of the ``health''
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the governing standard requires an exception
``where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the
preservation of the life or health of the mother,'' for this Court
has made clear that a state may promote but not endanger a woman's
health when it regulates the methods of abortion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska further emphasizes that there are no medical studies
``establishing the safety of the partial-birth abortion/D and ``no
medical studies comparing the safety of partial-birth abortion/D. .
. . And it points out that the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists qualified its statement that D may be the best or
most appropriate procedure by adding that the panel ``could
identify no circumstances under which the D would be the only
option to save the life or preserve the health of the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   We find these eight arguments insufficient to demonstrate that
Nebraska's law needs no health exception. . . . A rarely used
treatment might be necessary to treat a rarely occurring disease
that could strike anyone the state cannot prohibit a person from
obtaining treatment simply by pointing out that most people do not
need it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Using this law some present prosecutors and future attorneys
general may choose to pursue physicians who use D&AMP;E procedures, the
most commonly used method for performing previability second
trimester abortions. All those who perform abortion procedures
using that method must fear prosecution, conviction and
imprisonment. The result is an undue burden upon a woman's right to
make an abortion decision. We must consequently find the statute
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Thomas
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, this Court struck down an Act of the Texas Legislature
that had been in effect since 1857, thereby rendering
unconstitutional abortion statutes in dozens of states. As some of
my colleagues on the Court, past and present, ably demonstrated,
that decision was grievously wrong . . .
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of control
over her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life or
potential human life. Nothing in our federal Constitution deprives
the people of this country of the right to determine whether the
consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the
burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother. Although a state
 &UR; may &LR;  permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a
State  &UR; must &LR;  do so. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The standard set forth in the Casey joint opinion has no
historical or doctrinal pedigree. The standard is a product of its
authors' own philosophical views about abortion, and it should go
without saying that it has no origins in or relationship to the
Constitution and is, consequently, as illegitimate as the standard
it purported to replace. Even assuming, however, as I will for the
remainder of this dissent, that Casey's fabricated undue-burden
standard merits adherence (which it does not), today's decision is
extraordinary. Today, the Court inexplicably holds that the states
cannot constitutionally prohibit a method of abortion that millions
find hard to distinguish from infanticide and that the Court
hesitates even to describe. . . . In striking down this statute,
which expresses a profound and legitimate respect for fetal life
and which leaves unimpeded several other safe forms of abortion,
the majority opinion gives the lie to the promise of Casey that
regulations that do no more than ``express profound respect for the
life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial
obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose'' whether
or not to have an abortion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the almost 30 years since Roe, this Court has never described
the various methods of aborting a second- or third-trimester fetus.
From reading the majority's sanitized description, one would think
that this case involves state regulation of a widely accepted
routine medical procedure. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The most widely used method of abortion during this stage of
pregnancy is so gruesome that its use can be traumatic even for the
physicians and medical staff who perform it. And the particular
procedure at issue in this case, ``partial birth abortion,'' so
closely borders on infanticide that 30 states have attempted to ban
it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the State of Nebraska has a valid
interest, one not designed to strike at the right itself, in
prohibiting partial birth abortion. Casey itself noted that states
may ``express profound respect for the life of the unborn.'' States
may, without a doubt, express this profound respect by prohibiting
a procedure that approaches infanticide, and thereby dehumanizes
the fetus and trivializes human life. The A.M.A. has recognized
that this procedure is ``ethically different from other destructive
abortion techniques because the fetus, normally twenty weeks or
longer in gestation, is killed  &UR; outside &LR;  the womb. The ``partial
birth'' gives the fetus an autonomy which separates it from the
right of the woman to choose treatments for her own body. . . . The
next question, therefore, is whether the Nebraska statute is
unconstitutional because it does not contain an exception that
would allow use of the procedure whenever ``necessary in
appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the health of
the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In Roe and Casey, the Court stated that the state may
``regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is
necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of
the life or health of the mother.'' Casey said that a health
exception must be available if `` &UR; continuing her pregnancy &LR;  would
constitute a threat'' to the woman. Under these cases, if a state
seeks to prohibit abortion, even if only temporarily or under
particular circumstances, as Casey says that it may, the state must
make an exception for cases in which the life or health of the
mother is endangered by continuing the pregnancy. These cases
addressed only the situation in which a woman must obtain an
abortion because of some threat to her health from continued
pregnancy. But Roe and Casey say nothing at all about cases in
which a physician considers one prohibited method of abortion to be
preferable to permissible methods. Today's majority and Justice
O'Connor twist Roe and Casey to apply to the situation in which a
woman desires for whatever reason an abortion and wishes to obtain
the abortion by some particular method.

ROCKER CHANGES PLANS TO TAKE SUBWAY TO SHEA STADIUM IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If New Yorkers with nothing else to do Thursday
planned to take a ride on the No. 7 train to Shea Stadium hoping to
be in the same car as Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker,
they should find some other way to waste their time.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, a baseball official said Wednesday, has told Major
League Baseball he will not take the train to the game the Atlanta
Braves will play with the Mets Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, the Braves' walking controversy, had announced last week
his intention to ride the same train whose occupants he disparaged
in a magazine interview that earned him a suspension from playing
Major League Baseball and a fine. But baseball officials urged him
to reconsider and use another means of transportation, and he has
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no train ride,'' said the official. ``His
concentration is on the game. These are very important games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who will play the Mets for the first time since
their intense playoff clash last October, also issued a statement
in which Jim Schultz, the team's public relations director, said,
``It's our understanding that Mr. Rocker is not going to ride the
subway.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements notwithstanding, New York City police officials
said Wednesday that a police detail will be at the team's hotel
Thursday to accompany Rocker on whatever means of transportation he
chooses. If he boards the team bus, police will follow the bus. If
he takes a taxi, they will follow the taxi. In short, they do not
plan to let him out of their sight.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Orza, the players association's associate general counsel,
said he conveyed his view to Rocker that he should not take the
train and added, ``I think he's interested in being cooperative.''
</P>
<P>
   In declaring last week that he would go to Shea by subway, Orza
said, Rocker ``meant it in kind of the nature of an apology, saying
to the people of New York, `OK, I'll ride the train and we'll have
some fun with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Orza added, ``given New York's security concerns, he wasn't
going to see those people. He'd be surrounded by police officers.
It would not be the kind of ride he initially envisioned, which was
having some fun with the people in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Hallinan, baseball's security chief, met with Rocker in
Montreal, where the Braves played the past two days. Hallinan, the
baseball official said, explained to Rocker the problems a subway
ride would create and recommended he change his travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officials had an idea that Rocker should change his
hotel plans, too, staying not in Manhattan at the hotel with the
other Braves, but at the Marriott Hotel across from La Guardia
Airport, only minutes from Shea Stadium. That change would keep
Rocker away from crowded Manhattan streets and make it unnecessary
for him to ride the No. 7 train. But the idea was dropped after
Rocker assured the Braves that he would not take the train.
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in providing protection for Rocker and
security for the stadium met Wednesday afternoon at police
headquarters in Lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Five groups have signed up for a permit for a park area about 50
feet from the Willets Point/Shea Stadium subway station to protest
Rocker's presence. It is unclear how many people the protest may
draw, but police officials are prepared to deploy a contingent of
officers to oversee the 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. event.
</P>
<P>
   Police still plan to have about 600 officers on hand for the
game. They will include an undisclosed number of plainclothes
officers and others on horses to prevent fans from moving onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   In Montreal Wednesday, some Braves players arrived in the
visiting clubhouse to find the names above some lockers altered and
the missing letters used above Rocker's locker to form a phrase
that is insulting to gays. Rocker was not in the clubhouse at the
time, and Wally Joyner, a Braves first baseman, rearranged the
letters to spell the pitcher's name. Joyner said he wanted to
remove the offending phrase before Rocker saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did not speak to reporters for a second straight day.

 SUPREME COURT RULINGS FAVORS ABORTION RIGHTS  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court overturned
Nebraska's ban on so-called partial-birth abortion Wednesday,
saying it puts an ``undue burden'' on a woman's constitutional
right to terminate a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The decision _ the most important Supreme Court statement on
abortion in eight years _ handed a victory to pro-choice advocates
who argued that efforts by Congress and 30 states to ban such
procedures were part of a sophisticated campaign to undermine the
court's landmark 1973 Roe versus Wade ruling guaranteeing the right
to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-to-4 ruling in Stenberg versus Carhart struck down the
Nebraska ban on the grounds that it was too vague and could be used
by prosecutors to intimidate physicians performing other types of
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said the ban failed to allow any exceptions even
if a physician deemed a procedure necessary to protect the mother's
health, as the court required in Planned Parenthood versus Casey in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision is expected to overturn other similar
state bans, the court's deep division is likely to stir up the long
and bitter fight over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said Wednesday that the narrow 5 to 4 ruling thrusts
the issue into this year's presidential campaign, given that the
winning candidate could name as many as four new Supreme Court
justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court is always just one vote away from overturning the
basic right to choose,'' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. ``If the
next president appoints more anti-choice justices, this basic right
could be taken away at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee,
opposes bans on the procedure, while his Republican opponent, Texas
Gov. George Bush, favors them. Both campaigns issued statements
reaffirming those positions Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes coined the term partial-birth abortion to describe
a procedure performed after 19 weeks of pregnancy in which a fetus
is partially delivered feet first and then the physician punctures
and drains the skull that remains inside the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority that
prosecutors could use the Nebraska ban to criminalize a much more
common procedure performed between 12 and 24 weeks, in which part
of a fetus is dismembered or collapsed as it is pulled through the
birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those who perform abortion procedures using (that) method
must fear prosecution, conviction and imprisonment'' under the
Nebraska ban, Breyer wrote. ``The result is an undue burden upon a
woman's right to make an abortion decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David Souter
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the majority; Chief Justice William
Rhenquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The opinions reflected strong emotions on both sides, with
unusually bitter dissents.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, joining the majority, dismissed the ``gruesome''
language used by opponents of the procedure, noting that it could
equally describe procedures that the Nebraska ban would still
permit.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional right to abortion established by Roe versus
Wade, Stevens wrote, ``makes it impossible for me to understand how
a state has any legitimate interest in requiring a doctor to follow
any procedure other than the one that he or she reasonably believes
will best protect the woman in her exercise of this constitutional
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   To ban one procedure as ``infanticide'' while permitting an
equally gruesome alternative, he said, ``is quite simply
irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, dissenting, said he hoped the court's decision would one
day reside in the infamous company of the Korematsu ruling
upholding Japanese internment camps and the Dred Scott decision
declaring all slaves and their descendants to be noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The method of killing a human child _ one cannot even
accurately say an entirely unborn human child _ proscribed by this
statute is so horrible that even the most clinical description of
it evokes a shudder of revulsion,'' Scalia wrote. Requiring states
to permit a procedure if a physician deems it necessary to protect
a mother's health, he argued, ``is to give live-birth abortion free
rein.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who joined in upholding Roe versus Wade eight years
ago, said the ruling denies states the capacity to ensure that
medicine remains ``cognizant of the dignity and value of human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Raschke, a staff attorney for the pro-choice Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy, said the decision was a ``clear-cut
victory,'' but she expected abortion foes to continue trying to
attack abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Carroll, legislative analyst for the California ProLife
Council in Sacramento, said Wednesday's ruling ``only temporarily''
sets back the move to ban the controversial procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this country will continue to put up with
virtual infanticide,'' Caroll said. ``It will just take us longer.
... We have to win a presidential election. There will be a
different court someday.''
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate have voted three times to ban such
late-term abortions. Two bills were vetoed by President Clinton. A
third has passed just short of the votes needed in the Senate to
override a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Raschke said Wednesday's opinion ``exposed the deception behind
these so-called partial-birth abortion bans,'' which she said use
language that appears to ban one procedure but in fact would be
interpreted to cover many others.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Crosby, an attorney with the Northern California office
of the American Civil Liberties Union, warned that Justice
O'Connor's separate concurrence ``sounds an ominous note'' because
it said if Nebraska's ban had been more specific and allowed a
health exception, it should have stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's decision opens the door to dangerous experiments with
bans on safe abortion,'' Crosby said. ``I think it's clear ... that
the right to reproductive choice is far from secure.''
</P>
<P>
   But pro-life groups, following Justice Scalia's argument, said
the court's insistence on allowing this procedure if a physician
deems it necessary to protect the mother's health opens the door to
abortion by any means at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a radical expansion of the abortion right, expanding
that right outside the womb to include the killing of a child who
is but two inches from full delivery outside the mother's body,''
said James Bopp Jr., general counsel for the National Right to Life
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate 6 to 3 opinion, the Supreme Court also ruled that
states can restrict anti-abortion demonstrations outside health
clinics, upholding a 1993 Colorado ``bubble'' law banning unwanted
`'sidewalk counseling'' of abortion patients.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens said
Colorado's law does not deny free speech but only limits its
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   (The cases are Stenberg, Attorney General Of Nebraska, et al.
vs. Carhart, No. 99-830, and Hill et al. vs. Colorado et al., No.
98-1856.)

 SCOUTS' RIGHT TO BAR GAYS UPHELD  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A deeply divided U.S. Supreme Court dealt a setback to the gay
rights movement Wednesday, ruling that the Boy Scouts of America
can exclude gays from its organization.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-to-4 vote, the justices ruled that a New Jersey
anti-discrimination law requiring the Scouts, a national
institution for 90 years, to include gays as scout leaders and
members would violate the group's First Amendment rights of
``expressive association,'' the right of a group to choose members
who share an ideology or a set of values.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled against James Dale, an assistant scoutmaster in
New Jersey who was ousted from the organization after his troop
learned from a newspaper article that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is one of only a handful of cases that the court
has taken up that deal with gay rights. The justices have
repeatedly refused to hear challenges to President Clinton's
``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come along as far as we thought we had,'' said Matt
Coles, director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project.
``They seem to be saying that if you don't like gays, then the
First Amendment gives you the right to discriminate against them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that the practical effect of the decision may
be limited to private organizations that espouse values and views.
``It's a bad decision,'' he said, ``but it's not something that
people should regard as a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision is consistent with a 1998 California Supreme Court
ruling allowing Scouts to ban gays because the organization is not
a business subject to the state's anti-discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's decision, the majority noted that the Scout Oath
requires a member to strive to be ``morally straight'' and
``clean,'' values that the group says are inconsistent with
homosexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``A state requirement that the Boy Scouts retain Dale would
significantly burden the organization's right to oppose or disfavor
homosexual conduct,'' wrote Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But he
cautioned that ``we are not, as we must not be, guided by our views
of whether the Boy Scouts' teachings with respect to homosexual
conduct are right or wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision divided the justices along ideological lines, with
conservatives ruling in favor of the Scouts and liberals siding
with Dale.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said there
was no evidence that the Scouts organization was exercising any
expressive association, because it had adopted no clear policy
against gays. The Scouts' mission statement makes no mention of
sexual orientation, and scouts are advised to seek guidance on
sexual matters from religious leaders, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The Scout's requirement that a member be morally straight and
clean ``is a far cry from the clear, unequivocal statement
necessary to prevail on its claim,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional right ``is not a freedom to discrimination at
will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Scouts issued a statement saying the group is pleased with
the ruling, which allows it to stand by its membership policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision affirms our standing as a private association
with the right to set its own standards for membership and
leadership,'' the Scouts said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The group says that while it makes no attempt to discover the
sexual orientation of its members, ``we believe an avowed
homosexual is not a role model for the values espoused in the Scout
Oath and Law.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dale, now 29, said he was saddened by the decision.
``People don't join the Boy Scouts because they're anti-gay,'' he
said. ``People join the Boy Scouts because they want acceptance,
they want community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he still believes that the Scouts have a lot to offer.
For 12 years, he said, ``they taught me to respect and defend the
rights of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   But with this decision, Dale said, ``I think the Boy Scouts are
making themselves extinct, and that's a very sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale's attorney, Evan Wolfson of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, said the Boy Scouts are out of step with most other
youth organizations, including the Girl Scouts, which have no
anti-gay policy. He said he was heartened by Rehnquist's disavowal
of any endorsement of the group's anti-gay policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this case is going to open the floodgates of
discrimination,'' Wolfson said. He predicted that as a result of
the discriminatory practices, the Scouts will lose members, as well
as the support of public schools and other organizations that
sponsor individual troops.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for the Scouts said the organization, which
has 6.2 million members, is the largest youth organization in the
nation and has grown by 7 percent during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   George Davidson, the attorney for the Scouts, said he doubts
that the decision will reduce membership, because cases challenging
the Scouts' anti-gay policy have been widely publicized during the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The case, he said, was not a defeat for gay rights, but a strong
endorsement of freedom of association. ``This really is a great
victory for all Americans,'' Davidson said. ``The issue is the
right of organizations to decide their own policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale joined the Scouts in 1978 when he was 8 and eventually rose
to the rank of Eagle Scout. In 1989, he became an assistant
scoutmaster.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, a newspaper identified him as a leader of a gay
student group at Rutgers University. The Boy Scouts promptly
revoked his membership.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Dale filed a state discrimination claim, saying the
organization illegally removed him based solely on his sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   A trial judge dismissed the lawsuit, but an intermediate
appellate court reinstated Dale's claim. The New Jersey Supreme
Court also ruled in his favor, finding that the Scouts' policy
violated a state law barring discrimination by private groups open
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   (The case is Boy Scouts of America et al. vs. Dale, No. 99-699.)

BRIDGEPORT JOURNAL: PORTUGAL'S FANS CHEER A DISTANT HOME TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mass.)  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ As the game stretched into its second
overtime on Wednesday, the curses streaming out of the dusty men
inside Clube Portugues Vasco da Gama on James Street grew more
anguished.
</P>
<P>
   This was the point in the match at which men like these, almost
all of them Portuguese immigrants, hands thick as slabs of ham and
faces like creased leather, forgot about jobs, wives and children
and began to pray for the 12 sweat-drenched players on the
television, the pride of their nation: the Portuguese national
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   In a soccer stadium in Brussels, the Portuguese were battling
the bigger, more experienced French in the semifinal match of this
year's European Championship. Here in Bridgeport, home to the
largest Portuguese community in Connecticut, about 200 men (and
exactly two women) were staring at three televisions that were
carrying the game live.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Super Bowl,'' said Jaime Jorge, of Trumbull, a
marketing executive for a car-rental company who, like everyone
else here, took the Wednesday afternoon off to come to Vasco da
Gama, an 80-year-old soccer club with about 600 members. ``If you
watch the game at home, you're not going to ride that roller
coaster of emotion,'' said Jorge, who, at 31, was one of the
youngest in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Ribereiro, 52, an electrical contractor, said he had been
coming to the club about five days a week since he arrived from
Coimbra, Portugal, in 1982. ``This is the point where we all get
together,'' he said, finishing off a pork-chop-and-onions sandwich.
``We have this center and the church,'' Our Lady of Fatima, where
priests still say Mass in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 Portuguese or their descendants live in and
around Bridgeport, rivaling the two larger communities in Newark,
N.J., and in New Bedford, Mass. They began arriving in the first
decades of the 20th century, mainly from the northern region near
Chaves, and started new lives hauling in fishing nets, pounding
railroad ties and punching timecards in Bridgeport's factories.
</P>
<P>
   The Vasco da Gama soccer club, like the 15th-century Portuguese
explorer for whom it is named, is a point of reference and extreme
pride for the men and women who gather here several nights a week
and know one another by first name.
</P>
<P>
   The bar is made, they will tell you, of imported brown
Portuguese marble. Two glass cases on the wall are crammed with
trophies, team photographs and banners from other Portuguese,
Italian, Polish and German soccer clubs around the region.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Matos, 48, who normally spends Wednesday afternoons building
swimming pools, had not missed a Portuguese game since the European
Championship began last month. The team had surpassed expectations,
winning all four of its matches thus far. Matos, who immigrated in
1967, said his boss had no choice but to let him and his colleagues
take time off on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell him, `We got a soccer game, we gotta watch it,'''
Matos said, his hair, T-shirt and jeans coated with a fine layer of
cement dust. ``He gets mad, but what's he gonna do? We've got five
guys on the crew.''
</P>
<P>
   And the crew was here, watching the game. As the match
progressed, the cigarette smoke hovering over the marble bar grew
dense, the men more vociferous. Finally, in the 20th minute, a
Portuguese striker rocketed a shot past the French goalkeeper, and
Clube Vasco da Gama erupted with shouts of ``Golo!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna win, 2 to 0,'' claimed Matos, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second half, the French began attacking the
Portuguese goal, and the members of Clube Vasco da Gama, most of
them standing up, grew agitated. ``Onde esta penalto?'' the older
men would cry when a Portuguese player was tackled without a call
from the Austrian referee. They bellowed curses when the French
finally scored in the 52nd minute. But hope pulsed through
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the younger men said that if the team won, they planned
to drive across town and wave the Portuguese flag in front of a
social club for French people.
</P>
<P>
   As the second overtime wound down, the members of Vasco da Gama
twisted their bodies with every missed shot. The game finally
slipped away when a Portuguese defender was called for a penalty
kick. Seconds later on the field in Brussels, the French captain,
Zinedine Zidane, kicked and scored, winning the game, 2-1. Inside
Vasco da Gama, men turned away or hung their heads in silent agony.
A few began heated arguments over the referee's fatal call.
</P>
<P>
   Their prayers unanswered, the men's jobs, their wives and their
families came zooming back into focus. Heading out into the sunny
afternoon, many men talked with one another amiably, but with a
noticeable air of having missed winning the state lottery by a
single digit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it easy,'' Matos, the swimming pool builder, told a
visitor. There was always the next game, the next tournament, the
next chance for Portuguese soccer glory.

GREEN CARDS LEAD A STING TO DRUG RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 160 Colombian and Mexican suspected drug traffickers
believed to have been operating along the Eastern Seaboard were
charged Wednesday with trading vast quantities of cocaine and
heroin for green cards from an undercover agent posing as a crooked
official of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 of the suspects, most of whom lived in New York,
were arrested as scores of law enforcement officers fanned out in a
series of daybreak raids from New York City to southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The sting, which went by the code name Operation Wildcard, was
intended to cripple the New York arm of the Mexican and Colombian
drug cartels, particularly in upstate New York counties, said
Daniel J. French, the U.S. attorney in Albany, N.Y., whose office
is to prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These traffickers were very interested in obtaining green
cards so as to come and go freely from the United States,'' French
said. ``But the cards they were dealt came from a stacked deck.''
</P>
<P>
   The operation relied heavily upon an undercover agent of the INS
in the Albany area who posed as a corrupt official and agreed to
furnish the suspected traffickers with resident alien cards for
$5,000 to $13,000 each, French said. Many times, the payments came
in the form of drugs _ up to a half kilogram of heroin, for
example. The deals were made at a number of small upstate
restaurants, with names like Sharon's Place or Denny's, or highway
motels like the Best Western Inn.
</P>
<P>
   The suspected traffickers were steered to the INS agent by two
other undercover investigators working with the state police and
the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, who have been working
for several years to infiltrate the drug cartels, said James W.
McMahon, the state police superintendent. About a dozen of the
defendants arrested Wednesday were described as cell managers, or
leaders of the American wings of the cartels.
</P>
<P>
   While making the arrests, the authorities said, they seized
seven kilograms of heroin, said to be worth more than $10 million
on the street, and 12 kilograms of cocaine, said to have a street
value of about $5 million. They also seized about $350,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   French said the green cards were a crucial tool used by the
cartels, allowing the cell managers, their lieutenants and drug
smugglers to pass easily through U.S. borders. He added that all of
the defendants would be arraigned in Brooklyn in the next few days
and then sent to Albany for prosecution.

<P>
   Hanna Batatu, an authority on the contemporary Arab world who
was best known for his writings on Iraq and Syria, died on Saturday
at his home in Litchfield County in northwestern Connecticut. He
was 74.
</P>
<P>
   He had cancer, Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary
Arab Studies said in announcing his death.
</P>
<P>
   Batatu retired in 1994 as holder of the Shaykh Sabah Al-Salem
Al-Sabah Chair of Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a highly regarded book on Iraq, another on Syria and
articles on the two countries that appeared in scholarly journals.
His writing could be vivid. In an account derived from official
government sources, he wrote that after the Baath Party members who
dominated Iraq's governing council were ousted by an army coup late
in 1963, in the cellar of one building ``were found all sorts of
loathsome instruments of torture, including electric wires with
pincers,'' and ``small heaps of bloodied clothing were scattered
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Batatu ``was probably the greatest political scientist to study
the Middle East in the past 50 years,'' said Yahya Sadowski, a
professor of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University's Paul
H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. ``His analyses
of Iraq and Syria were unprecedented in their level of detail,
their nuanced understanding, and the authority of their
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The book on Iraq by Batatu is ``The Old Social Classes and the
Revolutionary Movements of Iraq: A Study of Iraq's Old Landed and
Commercial Classes and of Its Communists, Baathists and Free
Officers (1978, Books on Demand).
</P>
<P>
   Abbas Amanat, professor of modern Middle Eastern history at
Yale, said that book ``still maintains its place as one of the
major works of history of the 20th-century Middle East.'' It begins
at the turn of that century and draws on interviews that Batatu had
with many out-of-office Iraqi political figures, either in Iraq or
in exile.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews, Amanat said, provided Batatu ``with a thorough
and unique account of the events that otherwise would have been
lost to historians.''
</P>
<P>
   His book about Syria, ``Syria's Peasantry, the Descendants of
Its Lesser Rural Notables, and Their Politics'' (1999, Princeton)
was applauded in a review in the journal Foreign Affairs by L. Carl
Brown, a historian of the Middle East. He called the work ``vintage
Batatu, with awesomely thorough research,'' and added, ``This solid
sociopolitical study of modern Syria's rural population will take
its place among the classics of rural history.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Jerusalem, the son of Shukri Batatu and the
former Yvonne Nicodene, and had a job with the Palestine government
in Jerusalem in the 1940s. After the state of Israel was
established in 1948, he came to the United States as an immigrant
and worked for a carpet company in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Then he entered academe and received a bachelor's degree summa
cum laude in 1953 from Georgetown University's school of foreign
service and his doctorate in political theory in 1960 from Harvard.
His Harvard dissertation had the title ``The Shaykh and the Peasant
in Iraq, 1917-1958,'' and was the beginning of his Iraq book.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the American University of Beirut from 1962 to 1981
and at Georgetown's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies from 1982
to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Batatu is survived by his brother, Anthony Reynaud of Winsted,
Conn.; three nieces, Brenda Davis of Winchester, Cindy Fox of
Waterbury, Conn. and Mary Anne Sok of Torrington, Conn; and four
nephews, Anthony Reynaud Jr. of Winsted, John Reynaud of Torrington
and Jamil Abdallah and Sukri Abdallah, both of Jerusalem. He was
predeceased by a sister, Mary Abdallah.
</P>
<P>
   He was to have been honored this week by the American University
of Beirut as one of its Millennium Scholars.

LARRY KELLEY,   1936 WINNER   OF HEISMAN,   IS DEAD AT 85 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Conn., Mich. , Ill., Wis., Ohio)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Kelley, the Yale University end who won the Heisman Trophy
in 1936, then found himself back in the public eye six months ago
when he sold the statuette at auction for $328,100, died Tuesday at
his home in Hightstown, N.J., of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot
wound. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be a suicide,'' said Angelo Onofri, the Mercer
County administrative assistant prosecutor. Kelley's body was found
by his wife, Mary Ruth. He had been in poor health since suffering
a stroke last year. A note was left, but its contents were not
divulged.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of the Heisman, awarded by the Downtown Athletic
Club in New York to college football's top player, only three
schools have produced back-to-back winners of the trophy. Doc
Blanchard and Glenn Davis of Army won the award in 1945 and 1946
respectively, and Archie Griffin of Ohio State won it in 1974 and
1975. The school that first had consecutive winners was Yale _
Kelley and then running back Clint Frank.
</P>
<P>
   William Proxmire, the former U.S. senator from Wisconsin who
played football at Yale in the 1930s, would recall: ``The focus of
university attention was not on the best drama school in the
country or the relatively small but tremendously impressive law
school. To many _ probably most _ Yale meant Kelley and Frank and
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley was the first player to win the Heisman Memorial Trophy
under that name. The award was first presented in 1935, as the
Downtown Athletic Club Trophy, to Jay Berwanger, a University of
Chicago running back. When John Heisman, the former player and
longtime coach, died in October 1936, the award was named for him.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley's Heisman was sold at auction last December to the owners
of a sports bar and restaurant in Garrison, N.Y. ``I wanted to
right my affairs and my estate and take care of my 18 nieces and
nephews,'' said Kelley, who had suffered a stroke seven months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second Heisman to be sold. O.J. Simpson's 1968
Heisman was auctioned for $230,000 in February 1999 to help pay a
wrongful-death civil verdict against him won by the families of his
former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman, after he had
been acquitted in their murders.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Charles White, like Simpson a star runner at the
University of Southern California, auctioned his 1979 Heisman
Trophy for $184,000, saying he needed the money to pay federal
income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The hype that would come to surround the Heisman was hardly
envisioned when Kelley received the award. ``I got the telegram
telling me that I had won it, and I didn't even know there was such
a thing,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A two-way player in a time of limited substitutions, Kelley
sparkled on offense, coming up with many a timely catch and
touchdown play. As a sophomore, in 1934, he scored on a spectacular
43-yard reception off a fake-punt play to give Yale a 7-0 victory
over Princeton that broke the Tigers' 15-game winning streak. In
his Heisman season, as a senior, Kelley caught 17 passes for 372
yards _ in an era dominated by the running game _ to lead Yale to a
7-1 record. He had been the only player for Yale, Harvard or
Princeton _ the Big Three _ to score a touchdown in each of his six
games in the Ivy rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   He was voted into the National Football Hall of Fame in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, a native of Ohio, played high school football in
Williamsport, Pa., then attended the Peddie School in Hightstown.
The Princeton campus was nearby, but Kelley's football coach at
Peddie was a Yale alumnus and steered him to New Haven. Kelley also
starred in baseball and basketball at Yale and graduated as an
honor student.
</P>
<P>
   He gained a reputation as a glib and colorful character, tracing
the creation of his persona to the 1934 upset of Princeton. As
Kelley told it, Merri Scott, Yale's left tackle, noticed a
substitute halfback for the Tigers wandering around, looking
haplessly for the man he was supposed to replace. Scott tapped the
referee on the shoulder and said: ``Maybe that sub is in for me,
sir. I've been playing in Princeton's backfield all afternoon.''
The sportswriters credited Kelley with the remark and he was
instantly certified as a wit.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, Kelley rejected an opportunity to portray
himself in a movie to be titled ``Kelley of Yale'' and turned down
an offer from the NFL's Detroit Lions. He returned to the Peddie
School, where he taught and coached football, and he also taught at
Cheshire Academy in Connecticut. He served as alumni director at
Peddie before retiring in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is his only immediate survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Kelley was honored at halftime of the Yale-Princeton
game together with Dick Kazmaier, the Princeton tailback who won
the Heisman Trophy in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, on the eve of the Yale-Harvard game, Kelley and Frank
presented replicas of their Heismans for permanent display at the
Yale gym. ``I hope some potential Rhodes scholars visiting Yale
gain some inspiration,'' Kelley said then. ``And I hope they can
run, pass and kick.''  &QL;

OUTSPOKEN BISHOP AUSTIN VAUGHAN, 72, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan, who found himself in a brief
but public dispute over abortion with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo a decade
ago, died on Sunday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 72
and lived in Yonkers.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan, who had been on sick leave for several years, suffered
a heart attack earlier this month, said Joseph Zwilling, a
spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded as a conservative church leader, Vaughan was named
auxiliary bishop by Pope Paul VI in 1977. He was a professor of
theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers from 1956 to 1973 and
then its rector until 1979, when he was appointed vicar of Orange
County. He was fluent in Spanish, Italian and French as well as
Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan took his firm stance against abortion well beyond the
pulpit, and went to jail for it more than once. In 1990, he spent
10 days in an Albany lockup for trespassing after he tried to block
the entrance of a women's clinic the year before.
</P>
<P>
   While in jail, he caused a furor when he told an interviewer
that Cuomo was in ``serious risk of going to hell'' for upholding
abortion rights and public financing of poor women's abortions.
Cuomo responded that he would defend ``the right of this bishop to
curse any politician he wants, and every woman to make her own
judgment under the Constitution as to whether or not to have an
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, writing in Catholic New York, the
weekly newspaper of the archdiocese, noted that the bishop's views
were consistent with church teaching. In his first sermon out of
jail, at a Mass at St. Patrick's, his parish church in Newburgh,
Vaughan said: ``All I was saying is what he learned, and I learned,
and all of you learned in the first grade. If you commit a serious
sin and die without repenting, you go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Vaughan was born in Manhattan and graduated from St.
Joseph's Seminary in 1948. He received a licentiate in sacred
theology from North American College in Rome in 1952 and a
doctorate from Gregorian University there in 1954. Ordained in
1951, he taught modern languages before returning to St. Joseph's
as a professor. Bishop Vaughan is survived by a sister, Mae Murphy,
of Ridgefield, N.J.

CLIPPERS TALENT EXCITES BAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers ended up on top. And
that's not a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   With a flurry of activity, the Clippers set themselves up with
seven new players, including 18-year-old high-schooler Darius Miles
and three more in a trade for almost nothing with the Orlando
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Clippers have an NBA team that's loaded with potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's as much talent as we've ever had,'' said Elgin
Baylor, the Clippers vice president of basketball operations. ``We
have some terrific athletes on this team. . . . I think we
assembled a lot of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking Miles with the third overall pick, the Clippers
acquired guard Corey Maggette, power forward Derek Strong and the
10th pick, Missouri point guard Keyon Dooling, from the Orlando
Magic for a future first-round pick. With the 18th pick overall,
the Clippers took DePaul guard Quentin Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just so fortuitous,'' said Jeff Weltman, Clippers
director of player personnel. ``You couldn't dream it up any
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Weltman had been part of the Clippers brass that scouted the
6-foot-9, 215-pound Miles since he was a high school junior.
Despite not having Miles in for a workout, Baylor said the Clippers
knew enough about him to make the pick.
</P>
<P>
   Miles was surprised. The closest he has been to Los Angeles is
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy the team picked me up,'' Miles said. ``That means
they want me, because they picked me at No. 3 and I'm a high school
player. I'm glad to play for someone who wants me.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles said he will move his family to Los Angeles, including his
cousin, his mother Ethel and her boyfriend. Miles likes to compare
himself to Minnesota's Kevin Garnett, who also entered the NBA out
of high school in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a similar player to Lamar Odom,'' Baylor said. ``He's
slightly built. He's got great skills. He can run and jump and he's
still a kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at his upside, there is a great upside. When you
visualize him playing with Lamar, those two guys together. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clippers have had problems keeping top draft picks,
the new collective-bargaining agreement means the newly drafted
players will sign five-year-contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Trade rumors had the Clippers dealing Miles to the Magic for
Marcus Fizer, but Chicago ruined those plans by taking Fizer
fourth, one pick before the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Magic was willing to deal anyway, and the three-player
trade was practically a gift for the talent-starved Clippers. If
the Clippers are in the lottery again next year, they won't have to
give up the draft pick until 2002 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic fire sale came as the team looks to make a run at free
agents Tim Duncan, Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady and wanted to clear
room under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The deal landed Maggette, who averaged 8.4 points last year as a
rookie, and Dooling, the point guard the Clippers needed. Dooling,
another draft pick whose stock rose in draft workouts, averaged
15.3 points and 3.7 assists per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people underestimate me as a shooter and a
playmaker,'' Dooling said. ``I think I can bring some ability as a
point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   The final first-round selection was Richardson, who had been
projected as a lottery pick but fell to No. 18. Projected as a
shooting guard, the 6-6, 225-pounder averaged 17 points and 9.8
rebounds last season as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   The new players already bring a family feel. Richardson roomed
with Miles in Chicago before the draft, grew up in Illinois playing
against Maggette and he roomed with Dooling at an all-star camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a special situation we've got here with the
Clippers,'' Richardson said. ``I'm coming out here with a lot of my
friends. I like the way things look. We can be up and coming. I
think it's the sweetest situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first pick of the second round, the Clippers took Marko
Jaric, a 6-7, 200-pound shooting guard who plays in Italy. In
addition, the Clippers traded point guard Eric Murdock to the
Dallas Mavericks for power forward Sean Rooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a wonderful day,'' Baylor said. ``We've been
able to get a few veteran players in Strong and Rooks. We are very
talented and very athletic. I look at our team, we are pretty deep
at every position.''
</P>
<P>
   What's left for the Clippers is to name a new coach. Baylor
didn't say how close the team is but said that there might be some
candidates interested in coaching the new talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now. you take a look on the talent on this team, and a
lot of people would like to coach this team,'' Baylor said.

series earned the paper the Pulitzer Prize. The Beacon Journal also
tried to lead by example. Shortly after the series ended, it
introduced a lineup of columnists reflecting ``the perfect
demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman and a
white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is
white. The paper, it seemed, had become a proud model of racial

Here is Palm Beach, a posh playground for Vanderbilts, Astors and
their ilk since the 1920s, and Nievera is not being boastful about
the high-profile existence shared by him and his partner, Robert
Janjigian. A gregarious, notebook-wielding presence at cocktail
parties and charity events, Janjigian, 42, is the fashion editor of
the Palm Beach Daily News, known as The Shiny Sheet for the paper's
slick finish. The gardens that Nievera, 35, creates for members of
the local fete set show up in Architectural Digest. Yet their
primary residence is comfortably modest. So is its location.

   HARDY-PLANTS (Undated) One morning in early June, Dr. Peter del

roller coaster of recent climate changes. Among them is the Chinese
fringe tree (Chionanthus retusas), with its masses of little white

   CIR-WEB-SEARCH (Undated) _ Five years ago, search engines seemed
like the Web's salvation. Today, they need some saviors of their
own. When search engines first appeared, they were hailed for
accomplishing two things that could not possibly be done by people
on any large scale: search engines could find and index Web sites
almost as soon as they appeared. And they could almost
instantaneously match a page with a single keyword. But today, the
promise of automation has been tempered by the Web's success. There
are now more than one billion Web pages, and doubling every eight
months. Keeping up with that growth has been nearly impossible. To
cope, many search engines have concluded that simply indexing more
pages is not the answer. Instead, they have decided to rely on the
one resource that was once considered a cop-out: human judgment.

   CIR-CHINA-GAMES (Beijing) _ Three a.m. on a summer Friday in
Beijing. A smoke-filled room is packed with men, faces lighted by
computer monitors, adrenaline running from online combat. Bicycles
clutter the alley outside the door under the sign that reads NG
Cafe. The men are muttering into their headsets, discussing attack
strategies with teammates seated only a few computers away. NG Cafe
is a net cafe or a wangba, which serve as late-night entertainment
venues for hundreds of Beijing residents. The putative reason the
wangbas operate is to provide online access. But the global scope
of the Internet seemed mostly an afterthought in a room where 18 of
the 20 computers are engaged in electronic warfare with opponents
sitting nearby. The fact that the government considers the playing
of computer games in wangbas illegal has not stopped thousands of
them, and their cousins, game parlors, (which typically do not
provide Internet access, just locally networked computers) from
springing up across China. But the proliferation of wangbas and
game parlors in the last three years has vexed a government that
aspires to monitor social, political and economic trends. Wangbas,
the government believes, have the potential to alter all three. By

EDITORIAL: LANDSLIDE IN VOTE REQUIRING DONOR DISCLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 29:
</P>
<P>
   When the House finally voted on Wednesday morning to require
secret campaign slush funds to disclose their donors, the margin of
victory was huge. It was hard to remember that this very bill was
narrowly defeated two weeks ago and belittled by foes as something
the public did not care about. In trying to combat this supposedly
unwanted measure, Rep. Tom DeLay and the Republican leadership
cooked up a sham alternative that was so punitive toward unions and
violative of the privacy rights of nonpolitical groups that their
own members could not swallow it. In the end, DeLay had no choice
but to get out of the way and allow a vote on reform or be
stampeded by fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed by the House in a post-midnight session
Wednesday would stop a new, particularly indefensible form of
campaign abuse _ the spread of tax-exempt groups created under
Section 527 of the tax code to raise money from secret sources and
spend it on campaign ads. DeLay has created his own secret groups
and harvested uncounted sums for the campaign. Some supporters of
Gov. George W. Bush paid for ads attacking Sen. John McCain in
March, but they were eventually found out. A spectrum of groups
from the Sierra Club to various right-to-life organizations were
also raising money for ads under the Section 527 rubric.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is due to vote on the bill Thursday, and a similar
lopsided tally is possible. A nearly identical measure was already
approved, 57 to 42. But some senators who voted no last time under
pressure from Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell are now worried about
being punished in November by voters who have begun to pay
attention to campaign reform as an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate needs to act quickly, since every day of delay
guarantees that more truckloads of secret money will be harvested
by the slush fund organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to be on the right side of this issue proves several
things. When there is a clear up-or-down vote on campaign reform,
reform wins. Opponents have to resort to trickery to avoid a vote,
because they know that lawmakers cannot afford to be against
something desired by the public. The other lesson is that
bipartisanship can carry the day against an entrenched Republican
leadership. DeLay and Lott have always looked petty and high-handed
in opposing sound reform backed by a broad spectrum of the members
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republicans _ Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut,
Michael Castle of Delaware and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina _
came together to work with the Democrats, led by Martin Meehan of
Massachusetts, to make an unbeatable combination. Lloyd Doggett of
Texas, a Democrat who at times tried to use the issue for partisan
advantage, played a constructive role in the end. In the Senate,
McCain has gotten crucial support from another Republican, Olympia
Snowe of Maine. They have joined in their efforts with two
Democrats, Russell Feingold of Wisconsin and Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, campaign reform will not go away. It will be
important to remember that the bill requiring disclosure of secret
slush funds was dismissed two weeks ago by many reputable pundits
and lawmakers as having no chance. It now could be signed by
President Clinton in the next couple of weeks. The same ``experts''
have also said that a soft-money ban _ ending the practice of huge
unregulated sums contributed by corporations, unions and rich
donors to political parties _ also has no chance. If everyone feels
that way, the leaders should let there be an up-or-down vote. If
that happens, reform will win again. &QL;

FORMER YANKEE SHOWS DODGERS HOW TO WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took a week of sitting on the bench and waiting
for the chance. And waiting and waiting and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Leyritz finally got a chance to provide a big hit, and
he did just that in his fifth at-bat as a Los Angeles Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz crushed one of his former teams by delivering a game-
winning, two-out single to score Shawn Gilbert in the bottom of the
ninth and give the Dodgers a 5-4 win against the San Diego Padres
at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Winning close games late is where it counts and the Dodgers
haven't done it enough this season. Maybe things are changing after
their second straight one-run win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are 4-6 in games tied after eight innings. They're
10-11 in one-run games, 6-7 in two-run games and 4-3 in extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago they were 21-27 in one-run games, 12-16 in two-run
games and 4-12 in extra inning games. They were 4-8 in games tied
after eight innings. By comparison, the World Series champ Yankees
were 22-12 in one-run games last season and 7-2 in extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter started the game-winning rally by drawing a walk
off reliever Steve Montgomery, making his season debut. Gilbert
pinch-ran and moved to second on Alex Cora's single to right.
Pinch-hitter Todd Hundley flew out to center, but Leyritz's hit
reliever Kevin Walker's 1-2 pitch into the left field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (3-3) pitched two perfect innings of relief for the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park, who leads the National League
with 66 walks, had more problems finding the plate but continues to
show his increasing maturity as a pitcher. He walked four and hit a
batters but held it together enough to pitch seven innings for
sixth time in 10 starts. He allowed four runs on six hits and
struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego starter Adam Eaton allowed four runs on five hits in
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row the Padres jumped out to a quick
lead only to watch the Dodgers rally.
</P>
<P>
   Park was in trouble early as Ryan Klesko doubled to put runners
on second and third with one out. Phil Nevin followed with a single
through the middle to give the Padres a 2-0 lead in the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth, who usually homers in the first inning or
not at all, broke away from his normal pattern in the third inning
when he hammered Adam Eaton's 3-2 pitch over the fence in left
field to tie it 2-2. It was Hollandsworth seventh homer of the
season, five of which have led off a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 4-2 lead an inning later on Eric Karros'
second homer in as many days. Karros hit a 2-1 fastball for two-run
to left-center. It was his 23rd homer and gave him 65 RBI, both
second on the club to Gary Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   But Park couldn't make the lead hold up. Singles by Martin and
Klesko put runners on the corners with none out in the fifth, and
the Padres pulled within 4-3 on Bret Boone's sacrifice fly to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego tied it 4-4 an inning later when Park had control
problems. He got the first two outs off the sixth, but hit Eaton
with a pitch. Eric Owens walked, and Martin singled to center to
score Eaton.

EDITORIAL: THE COURT EXITS, IN CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 29:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ended its 1999-2000 term Wednesday with a
burst of important rulings that could reverberate into the fall
elections. The rulings involved a range of contentious social and
political issues _ abortion rights, public aid to parochial schools
and the civil rights of gay people.
</P>
<P>
   On a positive note, a sharply divided court reaffirmed a woman's
right to choose the safest method of abortion throughout pregnancy
by striking down Nebraska's ``partial-birth abortion'' law and, by
extension, similar laws enacted by 30 other states.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the day's other 5-4 decision, holding that the Boy
Scouts have a constitutional right to exclude gays, was a
disappointing departure from a proud line of high court precedents
erasing discrimination in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow margins in both cases serve as reminders that this
remains a court in considerable ideological turmoil over
fundamental questions of liberty. So, too, did the court's 6-3
ruling allowing the use of taxpayer money to buy computers and
other instructional material for religious schools. Apart from the
particulars of each case, the narrowness of the decisions also
reminds us that the next president will have the power to change or
reinforce the court's present disposition with only one or two
changes. Here is a brief look at Wednesday's major decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION.'' The majority opinion written by
Justice Stephen Breyer and joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor,
David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens affirmed a
lower court ruling overturning Nebraska's ban on the rarely used
procedure known as ``partial-birth abortion.'' This is the phrase
invented by pro-life groups to stigmatize all abortion procedures,
not only in late term but those commonly used before fetal
viability. These more common procedures have long been protected
under Supreme Court precedents, which the new ruling strongly
reaffirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously missing from the majority was Justice Anthony
Kennedy, who helped write the court's 1992 decision reaffirming the
right to abortion. This switch does not bode well for future cases.
However, the ruling vindicates President Clinton's repeated veto of
Congressional attempts to impose a similar national ban. It also
undercuts the strategy of politicians to claim to be pro-choice
even as they support the ``partial birth'' bans the court has now
ruled to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGIOUS SCHOOL AID. In a 6-3 decision, the court upheld a law
that requires public school districts to share equipment in a
``secular, neutral and nonideological'' way with students enrolled
in private schools. This is a relatively inoffensive result that
does not tell us how the court will vote on far more politically
charged cases involving tuition vouchers that are percolating up
the legal system. Four justices in the majority _ Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony
Kennedy _ made plain their approval of broad taxpayer support of
religious schools. But the two justices who voted with them,
O'Connor and Breyer, filed a separate opinion strongly objecting to
such wholesale breaching of the wall between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   GAY SCOUTS. The court reached one of its lowest moments of the
term when it ruled in favor of the Boy Scouts' right to exclude gay
members. The four dissenters _ Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer and Souter
_ did not challenge the principle that an organization cannot be
forced to adopt an unwanted message. But the dissenters correctly
noted that the Boy Scouts had failed to show that admitting gays
was fundamentally incompatible with the organization's core
mission, the test the court has traditionally applied to groups
trying to escape an anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   James Dale, the excluded Eagle Scout, deserved better. So did
the rest of the nation.

EDITORIAL: ELIAN GOES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 29:
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy found off the Florida coast
last Thanksgiving Day, returned home to Cuba on Wednesday night
after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an emergency request from the
child's relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States. It was
the proper legal conclusion to a bitter family dispute that dragged
on for months and drew international attention. The high court was
right not to take the case because there were no important issues
of law that had not been resolved by lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorial page opposed the predawn raid in
April by federal immigration agents to remove Elian from the home
of his Miami relatives as an unwarranted use of force against
citizens who were behaving in a recalcitrant but not violent
manner. But we have supported the father's right to regain custody
of the child and to decide where he should live. The relatives had
no business blocking the return of the boy to his father simply
because they equated paternal custody with delivering him to Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pandering by politicians to the passions of Miami's
Cuban-American community and despite intense community anger over
the raid, there was no deadly violence. The legal system provided a
rational process and has now produced a just outcome. All the
parties were allowed to make their arguments in court, with the
federal judges ruling that in this case only the parent could speak
for the young boy in making an asylum decision.
</P>
<P>
   Elian may yet find his way to a normal childhood in his country.
The image of the Cuban-American community in Miami, however, has
suffered because of its belligerence in disrupting familial ties
between father and son. The posturing by Miami's elected leaders in
refusing to aid federal authorities was insupportable. Miami city
politics have become more divisive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   On the national scene, the anti-Castro lobby has hurt its
message by seeming to use a child as a political prop. Perhaps most
harmful to that cause is that many Americans came to sympathize
with Elian's father and became more aware of America's outdated
policy of isolation toward Cuba. It is perhaps not surprising that
just one day before Elian's flight home, the House Republican
leaders agreed to end four decades of sanctions on food sales to
Cuba. The saga of this Cuban child helped to hasten that shift in
policy.

&HT;    ... CORRECTS GREEN STAT TO FINALS, NOT PLAYOFFS... 
LAKERS WAIVE GOODBY TO A.C., DRAFT MADSEN
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Just nine days removed from the glow of
their championship moment, the Los Angeles Lakers began the
retooling process Wednesday with two promising additions and one
painful subtraction.
</P>
<P>
   The net result: The only player to contribute to the Lakers'
last three championships probably won't be around for a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A.C. Green, who started every regular-season and playoff game at
power forward last season, was waived just hours before the NBA
draft. The Lakers then selected his potential replacement, drafting
Stanford big man Mark Madsen with the 29th pick.
</P>
<P>
   They also acquired swingman Cory Hightower, the 54th overall
pick, in a trade with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to cut ties with Green _ who left the Lakers
after winning two titles in the 1980s, then returned last season
and helped restore ``Showtime'' _ made the biggest waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions like this are most difficult, particularly when you
have the utmost respect for a true professional like A.C. Green,''
said Lakers executive Jerry West, who added that moves like this
are ``what I most despise about this part of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was not unexpected. Green will be 37 in October and was
due to make $1.9 million next season if the Lakers did not cut him
by Saturday. Releasing Green will save money and give the Lakers
room to sign a younger, more athletic power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Their payroll also is perilously close to the $55 million
threshold that will trigger the league's luxury tax in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something we felt we had to do in order to remain more
flexible going forward, also knowing that we're going to be facing
a potential tax,'' West said. ``And as I stated before, our job is
one of trying to assemble a team that not only can be competitive
on the court but also stay within the guidelines of what our owner
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Green was traveling and unavailable for comment, but agent Marc
Fleisher said Green understood the decision. Green does not intend
to retire, and both Fleisher and Laker officials suggested he could
even return to the Lakers, albeit for less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very, very loyal to the Lakers,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Green averaged 5.9 rebounds in the regular season but slipped to
3.3 rebounds in the Finals and surrendered most of his minutes to
Robert Horry. Green and Horry were an adequate tag team, but the
Lakers were hurt in the playoffs by more athletic forwards, from
Sacramento's Chris Webber to Portland's Rasheed Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to find the answer in the free-agent market, using
their $2.25 million salary-cap exception. Last summer they
unsuccessfully dangled the exception in front of Charles Oakley and
Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get a very attractive player as a free agent
with our midrange exception,'' West said. ``If not, we can always
go back to A.C. Green and see if there's some interest on his part
coming back here. But my best guess is we're going to look for help
in the free-agency market.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who they get, the Lakers hope to see an immediate
contribution from the 6-foot-9, 240-pound Madsen, who played four
years for the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about having this guy,'' West said. ``He's a
tough, hard-nosed kid. I think he has an opportunity to play right
away. . . . And my best guess is he will be a tremendous crowd
favorite here. This guy plays really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen averaged 12.2 points and 9.4 rebounds as a senior. His
nickname, ``Mad Dog,'' says everything else _ he's aggressive and
physical, attributes the Lakers sorely need.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need physical players in basketball,'' coach Phil Jackson
said, ``and you need players that are willing to put their body on
the line, to take charges, to plug the lane, to do other things
that are important for a ballclub to keep the opponents away from
penetration. And that's one of the things I think this young man
has demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has to play within the framework of how we play as a
team, and how his enthusiasm ignites us or brings us to that level
is important.''
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm was evident in a brief conference call with
reporters. Madsen, a lifelong Lakers fan, put an exclamation point
at the end of every sentence and said he ``jumped about 10 feet in
the air'' when the Lakers picked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how excited I am right now to be joining such
a first-class organization,'' said Madsen, whose grandparents live
in Long Beach. ``I love Southern California, I love the area, and I
absolutely love the Lakers. I grew up watching the Lakers and I
just think the world of coach Phil Jackson _ I've read his books
and I'm just so excited to be joining the Lakers.''
</P>

   The Lakers did not have a second-round pick but obtained

Iowa _ from the Spurs in exchange for second-round picks in 2001
and 2002.

JET LAG BOTHERS HUMBERT; HE STARS ANYWAY VS. CROATIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ His primary role on the U.S. National
Water Polo team is to set up himself up in the front of the
opponents goal and, with the opposition pummeling him from on top
and under the water, get a good scoring opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the easiest of roles for Chris Humbert, or any other
two-meter man, even with a good night's sleep. But it becomes
downright excruciating when just over 24 hours you stepped off a
plane following a 14-hour flight and your body clock says it's
about five in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert, who stepped off a jet on Tuesday after finishing off a
professional season in Greece, looked pretty darn fresh, even
though he admitted otherwise afterwards, while scoring five goals,
including the game-winner and the clinching goal in an 11-9 triumph
over Croatia before 1,000 in the UPS International Cup at the U.S.
National Aquatic Center on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired and jet-lagged,'' said the 6-foot-7, 225-pound
Humbert, who is perhaps the world's best player at his position.
``It's about five in the morning Greece time.''
</P>
<P>
   Humbert was at the team's opening 7-7 tie with Australia on
Tuesday, but he didn't suit up. It wasn't difficult on Wednesday to
see the impact he makes when in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big presence in the two-meter for sure,'' said U.S.
head coach John Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal, which came at 4:40 left, came when Humbert
fought for position, took a nice entry pass from Gavin Arroyo and
somehow snuck the ball past Croatian goalkeeper Goran Volarevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how I did that,'' said Humbert, who converted
five of 7 shot attempts. ``I'll have to watch the tape and see. I
was just trying to throw it toward the cage. There was a lot of
luck there.''
</P>
<P>
   The clincher came with 1:25 left when Humbert fired the ball
into the cage on a 6-on-5 advantage to give the U.S. (1-0-1) its
sixth goal in 10 man-advantage situations. Humbert had created the
man advantage by drawing an ejection.
</P>
<P>
   However, Croatia (1-1-0) wasn't done. With 50 seconds left
Robert Lynn committed a four-meter foul to create a penalty shot
for Croatia. The attempt by Dubravko Simenc got past U.S.
goalkeeper Dan Hackett but stayed out of the cage by striking the
bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't get a whisker on it,'' Hackett told his teammates
moments later.
</P>
<P>
   The bar was also Hackett's friend with 11 seconds left on a shot
by Ivo Ivanis. Hackett also kept the ball out of the net more
traditionally by blocking nine shots during the game, including
several in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   The other U.S. goals were scored by Arroyo, Lynn, Tony Azevedo,
who converted a penalty shot but missed on all three attempts from
the field, Chi Kredell, Chris Oeding and Brad Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is I'm pleased how well we played today after
(Tuesday's game),'' said Vargas, who praised the two-meter work of
Humbert, Kyle Kopp and Ryan Bailey. ``We're trying to be tournament
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the most important tournament games will come in
September in Sydney and the U.S. will open play against Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't forget (Wednesday's game), we'll try to learn from
it,'' Vargas said. ``It's more important to win at the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia 12, Team UPS 6: It wasn't a sharp performance by the
tournament favorite, but Yugoslavia (2-0-0) had plenty to get past
Team UPS (0-2-2). Jerry Smith and Omar Amr had late goals for Team
UPS to make the score more respectable. Team UPS, which is made up
of young American players, will play the U.S. National team tonight
at 8:30.
</P>
<P>
   Italy 10, Australia 5: Marco Gerini had eight saves and Leonardo
Sottani scored three times to push Italy (1-1-0) past Australia
(0-1-1).

HILL BRIGHTENS ANGELS' FOCUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia held a team
meeting before Wednesday's game against the Seattle Mariners,
reminding his players it's a long season and that it's important to
come to the ballpark every day with a consistent approach.
</P>
<P>
   But what keyed the Angels' 3-2 win on this night simply was good
pitching, the kind of pitching they will need to contend in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill (4-4) returned from a seven-week absence caused by a
strained rib-cage muscle, and held the Mariners to one run and four
hits in six innings to earn the victory. Shigetoshi Hasegawa and
Troy Percival (19th save) combined for the final three innings to
close it out before 32,581 at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory snapped the Mariners' winning streak at seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing six innings was something Hill did only twice in his
eight starts this season before his injury. He was still throwing
ha sixth, hitting 94 mph on the radar gun, when he had to face the
heart of the Mariners lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez, John Olerud and Jay
Buhner in the inning, Hill gave up only a walk to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels fared only slightly better against Mariners starter
Jamie Moyer, though they had their chances. With one out in the
first inning, the Angels loaded the bases with a single and two
walks for Garret Anderson, who grounded into a force play at
second. Anderson barely beat the relay to first, allowing Benji Gil
to score and give the Angels a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus followed with a single to center field to drive in Mo
Vaughn for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hill kept the lead at two until Martinez homered with one out in
the fourth inning, cutting the Angels' lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance to get the run back and increase their
lead in the fifth after Gil tripled, Vaughn was hit by a pitch and
Tim Salmon walked to load the bases with one out for Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer got ahead in the count, 0-2, but Anderson fouled off five
pitches with two strikes. Anderson eventually struck out swinging
at a 75-mph changeup on a 2-2 count. Moyer then struck out Glaus to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had yet another chance with runners in scoring position
in the seventh. The Angels had already scored once in the inning on
Gil's RBI double. Gil went to third when center fielder Mike
Cameron lost Vaughn's fly ball in the sky for a single, but Salmon
struck out for the first out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson then grounded into an inning-ending 1-6-3 double play,
the 15th double play he's grounded into this season, fourth most in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking a season-worst 6-game deficit in the AL West into
Wednesday's game, Scioscia repeated what he has said all season _
that his club should focus on itself and not what other clubs are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our season depends on how we play, not how other teams play,''
he said. ``We as coaches talk every day about being patient. This
club has come a long way. It has a high ceiling. It has to reach a
certain level and play on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it be good enough to win a division that has teams like
Oakland and Seattle that are putting together long winning
stretches?
</P>
<P>
   ``If winning this division takes winning 90 games, we have to
make sure we win 91,'' Scioscia said. ``If we win 95 and somebody
else wins 105, that's pretty much out of our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning 90-plus games is something Scioscia, his staff and the
front office have believed his club could do since spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this team in a special light a lot of people don't,''
Scioscia said. ``There is a lot of talent. You look at what some of
these players have gone through the last three or four years. They
do respond to adversity. There have been some good years and some
hard years. There's a feeling deep down inside they can win.''

EX-YANKEE COMES THROUGH FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took less than a week for the players to give
Jim Leyritz some guff. He arrived in a trade for Jose Vizcaino, the
Los Angeles Dodgers lost five in a row, and Leyritz's most
productive time at home plate came in cameo catching appearances.
</P>
<P>
   However, Leyritz figured his opportunities would come, and he
got one of them with two outs and two on in the ninth inning
Wednesday. He came through like it was the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz's single into the left-field corner scored Shawn Gilbert
from second and gave the Dodgers a 5-4 win over the San Diego
Padres at Dodger Stadium. It was the second consecutive night the
Dodgers won with a two-out single in their last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real clutch hitter and everyone knows what he's done
with the Angels and Yankees and Padres with so many clutch hits,''
Dodgers right fielder Shawn Green said. ``I think everyone in the
park thought he was going to do his job, and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz was 0 for 4 with a walk in four games, and when he
joined the club, the Dodgers went on a season-long five-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling them, 'Maybe it's me, maybe it's me,' and they
were riding me a little bit, too,'' Leyritz said. ``It made me feel
good, but at the same time the ballclub was playing good, and to be
able to come back and me being able to contribute, you feel good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about being back over here in the National
League and with this ballclub is going to be that opportunity to
get that one at-bat maybe a day. Mentally, it makes you a lot more
prepared coming to the ballpark. I'm really starting to enjoy
myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Leyritz come through with the game-winning hit is the
exact scenario the Dodgers thought about when they acquired him
from the Yankees last week for Jose Vizcaino. He's made a career of
hitting huge homers in the postseason and he's relishing the role
of being a pinch-hitter for a National League manager who loves to
double switch.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz's presence also puts the matchups in the Dodgers' favor,
something manager Davey Johnson only dreamed of a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Padres manager Bruce Bochy) was between a rock and hard
spot,'' Johnson said. ``He left me to control the matchup because
he knows if he brings in (right-hander Carlos) Almanzar, I'm going
to go with (lefty Dave Hansen). I burned three guys to win it
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Kreuter started the game-winning rally by drawing a walk
off reliever Steve Montgomery (0-1). Gilbert pinch-ran and moved to
second on Alex Cora's single to right. Pinch-hitter Todd Hundley
flew out to center, but Leyritz hit Kevin Walker's 1-2 pitch into
the left-field corner for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers bench would have been nearly depleted had Leyritz
not gotten the hit.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Adams (3-3), plagued by stiffness in his right shoulder,
pitched two perfect innings of relief for the win. Todd
Hollandsworth and Eric Karros each hit two-run homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was big for our bullpen to keep the rest of the guys in the
bullpen out of the game,'' Adams said. ``Guys needed some rest
because we've been getting a lot of work lately, so to have one guy
go in there and pitch and give the rest of the guys the day off is
huge.''

JAMAL CRAWFORD GETS A FRESH START WITH THE BULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wheeling and dealing and milking the system is a punishable
offense when you're a so-called student-athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jamal Crawford about that.
</P>
<P>
   Last season at Michigan, the Wolverines freshman was
investigated and suspended by the NCAA for allegedly accepting a
car and some jewelry from a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   The violations tussle sent Crawford, Michigan's high scorer,
running for the NBA draft, where he was one of 29 high-school
players or college underclassmen up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. This is now. And in the big, rich world of the
NBA, it's all good when it comes to wheeling and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night in Minneapolis at the scene of the 2000 NBA
draft, not only was Crawford the surprise pick by Cleveland at the
unexpectedly high No. 8 spot, the 20-year-old guard out of Rainier
Beach was immediately used as leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, an NBA team using a kid as a bargaining chip in a
draft-day deal that lets team officials act on their dark and
devious impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out everyone's looking for some easy money.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments after Crawford was plucked from a sea of young and
restless NBA wannabes, the Bulls turned around and traded their No.
7 pick, 7-foot center Chris Mihm, to Cleveland for Crawford _ and
some cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago told me they were going to take him at No. 7, but they
wanted to make Cleveland feel like they were going to take Mihm to
get money out of the deal,'' Crawford's agent Aaron Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Shenanigans aside, this draft-day tango will soon be forgotten.
It won't matter how Crawford got to Chicago. All that will matter
is what happens once he gets there, because he was such a high
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to be drafted, always wanted to shake David
Stern's hand. To go this high _ the highest to ever go out of the
state of Washington _ that's just a dream for me, and I'm just
going to get a fresh start in Chicago,'' said Crawford, who was
accompanied by his father, Clyde, and his toddler son, Eric.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes are on young guns like Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   He and other talented basketball players are somehow being used
as the reason basketball at the college and pro level is undergoing
such an upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Crawford had no idea about the tricks Chicago
was playing on Cleveland by drafting Mihm and then bartering for
Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   He even said he was going to wear a red suit, thinking the Bulls
liked him. When they passed him by at the No. 7 pick, Crawford
thought nothing about it, figuring he could get used to playing in
Cleveland with the likes of Shawn Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they told me I was traded, I thought they were joking,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford was the first guard taken in this year's draft _
probably the right call.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw St. John's Erick Barkley throw away the Red
Storm's NCAA tournament chances knows that Crawford was a better
pick. The Trail Blazers took Barkley at No. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Alexander and Keyon Dooling were rated higher earlier
this spring, and there were always questions about how Mateen
Cleaves' game would translate to the NBA. Khalid El-Amin went in
the second round, and wound up in Chicago with Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   But Crawford went first Wednesday night because he went to
Chicago for a pre-draft camp and blew away the competition, blew
away his detractors and blew away the scouts.
</P>
<P>
   His game is silky smooth, and he let that show. He handles the
ball very well with those long fingers, and can lull defenders into
a trance with his dribble before slashing to the hoop or letting
fly a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   He also has excellent court awareness, a benefit no doubt from
years of playing with fellow Seattle hoopsters like Doug Christie,
Jason Terry, Shammond Williams and Gary Payton. He displayed the
kind of confidence and calm that made him far less of a gamble than
originally forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say I'm the best, but I think I was one of
the best. I'm not going to say I'm better than them, but I'm not
going to say they're better than me, either,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I just showed my overall versatility. I shot NBA
3-pointers, 9-for-10. I showed that I can handle the ball as a pure
point guard at 6-foot-5. I think that's pretty rare. ... After
Chicago, my name just took off a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Jordan NBA, as the league seeks to redefine itself
and come to terms with a steady influx of younger players, the
meter is running on the young guns.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, to his credit, has never let criticism or tough times
deter his effort to get better at his game. If he had an advisor in
Barry Henthorn, who may have steered him wrong on money issues,
Crawford has had just as many solid boosters within the Sonics
organization, who let him know he was on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   It also says something about the young man that between the
limbo state he was in during his NCAA suspension and his decision
to go pro, he raised the level of his game so no one could doubt
his talent.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Crawford was an example of what's wrong with college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Next, considered too green, too young for the draft, Crawford
was an example of what's wrong with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Wednesday night, Crawford was good enough for one team to
pick him No. 8, then trade him for the No. 7 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about about moving up the charts with a bullet.

MARINERS' WIN STREAK ENDS AT 7 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sinatra occasionally had to clear his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway frequently had writer's block.
</P>
<P>
   Freud sometimes had bad dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, can say that the Mariners weren't going to lose one
eventually?
</P>
<P>
   It's just that they don't think they should have lost this one.
Handcuffed by the pitching of Anaheim starter Ken Hill and the
Angels bullpen, the Mariners saw their seven-game losing streak end
in a 3-2 loss Wednesday night at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Given the number of hits they've had lately, it's been a tribute
to the pitching and defense that the Mariners came into Wednesday
night with any kind of winning streak. In their last four games,
they have just 22 hits, an average of 5{ per game. To get three
wins out of that is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a winning recipe together out of few ingredients becomes
harder each successive day. It had to come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   It did Wednesday night, with Seattle collecting just six hits.
Two of them were monster homers by Edgar Martinez and Alex
Rodriguez, but both came with the bases empty, and the offense
beyond that was as dry as the Sahara. Seattle was fortunate that
Oakland lost 5-3 at home to Texas, so the Mariners remain just
one-half game out of first place in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losses aren't easier to take just because you've won a bunch
of games in a row,'' Rodriguez said. ``We feel we could have won
this one. But it's not like we blew it. They just beat us with good
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to us to come out (today) with better energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill had plenty of energy stored up. He'd spent the last six
weeks on the disabled list, but in his first start in the majors
since May 6, Hill looked as if he'd been in an extended groove.
Gifted with a 2-0 lead in the first inning, he allowed just one run
_ Martinez's homer _ in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their pitchers pitched well,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``There are just times you have to give the other side credit.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Piniella and the Mariners were more than
willing to give losing pitcher Jamie Moyer credit. If you didn't
know the final score, you might have thought Moyer had won.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-run first inning that could have been worse than it
was, Moyer settled down and held the Angels at bay for the next
five.
</P>
<P>
   That was particularly true in the fifth, when nothing more than
Moyer's sheer force of will got the Mariners home without a run
being scored. The Angels loaded the bases with one out for two of
the biggest boppers on the roster _ Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer matched up with Anderson in what was as much a battle of
wills as it was a battle of skills. The Anaheim center fielder
fouled off pitch after pitch, but Moyer kept throwing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After eight pitches, catcher Joe Oliver came out to the mound,
if only to give Moyer a break. Then, on the 10th pitch of the
at-bat, Moyer snuck a pitch past the flailing Anderson. Moments
later, Moyer struck out Glaus, too, stranding all three runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``That fifth inning defines Jamie,'' fellow starter Aaron Sele
said. ``He was in a jam, and he fought his way out. Their guy,
Anderson, was battling, too, but Jamie kept coming with quality
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a gamer, and guys like that are in short supply.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side has some gamers, too, even if the Mariners have a
nice edge in the standings as the West is currently constituted.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, first-year Angels manager Mike Scioscia held a
team meeting, after which he was quick to point out that he was
impressed with his club's competitive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the desire in these guys to kick butt,'' Scioscia said.
``It's something you want to see in your team. They come out with
the passion to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The young but improving Angels needed a win to keep pace with
Seattle and Oakland, and they got it in the form of six strong
innings from Hill, who was making his first start since coming off
the disabled list. Troy Percival finished up an impressive evening
for Angels pitchers by throwing a scoreless ninth for his 19th
save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen Hill a lot over the years, so not much he does is
going to surprise us,'' Rodriguez said. ``But for a pitcher coming
off the disabled list, he was able to throw his fastball at speeds
six or seven miles (per hour) apart, and that was surprising. One
would come in at 87 and another at 94.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed game was evident in the Mariners' bullpen, too. Brett
Tomko threw hard and relatively loose in his first inning since
June 6 _ he came off the disabled list Saturday _ and Jose Paniagua
and Jose Mesa continued to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua threw yet another scoreless inning of relief in the
eighth. He's allowed just one run this month and one run, in fact,
in his past 16 games. During that time he's lowered his ERA on a
glacial scale, trimming it from 6.97 on May 19 to 3.99.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa followed Paniagua by throwing a scoreless ninth. It was
another in a string of strong efforts by Mesa, who has allowed
three earned runs in 13 innings in June, an ERA of 2.08 for the
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of nice pitching, particularly from Paniagua and
Mesa late and Moyer,'' Piniella said. ``But their pitchers didn't
give us any runs.''

   MEXICO CITY _ Nearly three-quarters of a century after it took
power, Mexico is preparing to reject the political party that has
exerted an iron grip on the life of the country for as long as most
people can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Mexico's presidential election, the race looks
set to be the closest and most bitter in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet polls consistently indicate that the seven-decade rule of
the Partido Revolutionario Institutional (PRI) will be broken, an
event as historically significant as the fall of the Berlin Wall,
according to the main opposition candidate and presidential
front-runner, Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But as the usually jaded Mexican voters sense their ballots
could actually make a difference and are showing up for campaign
rallies in record numbers, complaints of intimidation, vote-buying
and coercion by the establishment have been logged across the
country, in spite of a new independent electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
   And while Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who leads the
center-right Alliance for Change, urges the young and disaffected
to unplug the old political machine, all the well-oiled mechanisms
of the PRI are being brought to bear against its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who dares suggest that the PRI will resort to fraud is
``crazy or irresponsible,'' its candidate, Francisco Labastida,
told 100,000 supporters in Mexico City's main plaza earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that unless the PRI triumphs by a decisive margin of 10
percent _ more than it would be able to manipulate _ he will refuse
to accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The former mayor of Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who
founded the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, is running third
with barely 20 percentage points, while the other candidates each
claim twice this support.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Cardenas joined with Fox to denounce the government-run
petroleum industry, Pemex, for pressuring civil servants to
campaign for the PRI or else lose their jobs. This son of a former
president railed against the PRI for its ``blatant attempts to
blackmail the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Every lamp post is now plastered with some politician's smiling
face and competing banners are strung across the skyline like
bright laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Government pledges to keep the campaign clean drew smirks this
month when the Yucatan governor, a PRI loyalist, doled out more
than 1,000 washing machines and packets of detergent to poor
housewives in his district.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials in Tabasco state finally released flood
disaster payments which had been tied in red tape since last
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported that homeowners supporting the PRI were
given $600 while opposition backers made do with $200. Poor
citizens who depend on cash payments from social programs fear that
they risk getting cut off unless they actively back the
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government's social programs are PRI programs and
we're going to use them to win the presidency,'' said Manuel
Bartlett, a former interior minister, while campaigning for
Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who turns 58 on election day _ July 2 _ is appealing to
youthful voters, who rarely have bothered to take part in past
elections, as well as to women.
</P>
<P>
   Running on an anti-corruption manifesto, the former Guanajuato
governor stands 6-ft., 5-in. in his cowboy boots and claims he has
raised new standards in political life. But old-time Mexicans do
not quite know how to deal with this brash outsider, who sells his
vision of the future with earthy soundbites. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ To see how far President Robert Mugabe, one-time
national hero of Zimbabwe, has fallen you had only to attend the
opposition's recent election rallies. It could be measured in the
raucous laughter that followed the numerous, and sexually risque,
``Bob and Grace'' jokes.
</P>
<P>
   The gags about President Mugabe and free-spending Grace, four
decades his junior, whom he married in 1996, lost something in
translation from Shona to English. But the biting sarcasm, that
even a few years ago few would have dared express in public,
survived.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians _ come-standup comedians _ who worked the crowds
linked the president's political and private sins, and concluded
that Mugabe's kleptomaniac tendencies were so ingrained that he had
even felt compelled to steal Grace, another man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone had dared tell the old man about the daily ridicule,
he might have wondered when, and possibly even why, the rot set in.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that over twenty years Mugabe allowed his
overriding greed for power to cloud his judgment and distance him
from his people.
</P>
<P>
   During the weeks of pre-election, state-sponsored violence, many
ordinary Zimbabweans concluded that Bob loved power more than his
country, and perhaps he always had.
</P>
<P>
   It all started so well. In 1980, when Mugabe became prime
minister, after his successful bush war against the minority white
regime of Ian Smith, he was largely adored and the former British
colony he inherited was in healthy shape.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy hardly mattered after the common black enemy _
colonialists and white racists _ was defeated, and Mugabe was feted
at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The president had made his own sacrifices for the cause. He
spent ten years in jail, separated from his first wife Sally,
courtesy of the Smith regime, and was inside when their
four-year-old son _ their only child _ died.
</P>
<P>
   And to be fair, Mugabe, who acquired several degrees in jail,
set about improving the conditions of his downtrodden people. He
poured money into education even when the international monetary
institutions disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, some Zimbabweans say, is that by creating an informed
population, he was educating himself _ in the long term _ out of
power.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was always authoritarian but throughout his reign his
greed for power just kept growing. He made laws, amended the
constitution and massacred rivals to increase his control and that
of his party, ZANU-PF.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe became a one-party state, run by ZANU and its corrupt
cronies, where dissent was discouraged, sometimes brutally.
</P>
<P>
   When the much-loved Sally Mugabe died in 1992 so did some of the
public's affection for her husband. Grace's arrival - along with
the revelation that Mugabe had fathered a child by her when Sally
was still alive _ just added to public disillusion.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for multiparty democracy began to emerge in the late
1980s, championed by trade union leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, who
would, a decade later, form the Movement for Democratic Change _
and challenge Mugabe. But it was the economic disaster Mugabe
presided over during the 1990s that created the mass clamor for
political change.
</P>
<P>
   With his back against the wall, Mugabe acted like a dinosaur. He
harked back to a bush war that meant little to a new generation,
and spouted now meaningless Cold War rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   And when he tried to play his last card _ the racist one _ and
blame white farmers for the country's ills, few Zimbabweans bought
it. Many just laughed at the old man, hero turned despot and now
figure of fun. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. electorate is treating the Gore-Bush
presidential contest as one colossal yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits forecast that the turnout in November could be the
lowest on record. The television networks are scaling down their
campaign coverage, and most have decided to leave gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the nominating conventions in July and August to the
specialist cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   But news is gradually seeping out that Al Gore and George W
Bush, two bland offspring of famous political families, will not
have the publicity field entirely to themselves this summer, not
during their setpiece conventions, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on an idea from Arianna Huffington, the glamorous and
sharp-tongued columnist formerly married to the millionaire and
failed senatorial candidate, Michael Huffington, an alliance of
groups is organizing two alternative conventions to shadow the
official ones, day by day and hour by hour.
</P>
<P>
   These shadow conventions promise to be more fun, and probably
more glitzy, than the official ones, which could well displease the
many commercial sponsors of the Gore and Bush extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, for instance, the band will strike up, the
strobe lights flash, and on to the stage will stride John McCain
with his hearty wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good evening and welcome,'' he will shout to ecstatic cheers,
before lambasting the corruption of a political system that
railroaded through its favorite sons before half the electorate had
had a chance to choose.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Democrats can expect Warren Beatty to reprise
his Bulworth act from the film of that name, unleashing a torrent
of invective about the real state of the nation and the cynicism of
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   They will also be treated to tub-thumping equality rhetoric from
Jesse Jackson, and maybe a touch of insurrectionist argument from
Ralph Nader, devoted advocate of ordinary people and newly crowned
nominee of the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a technique used at recent party conventions, when
``real'' people are recruited to praise the nominee, both shadow
events will hear from ordinary citizens who say they have been
victimized during the past eight years of the Clinton presidency.
There will be entertainment, with contributions from such household
names in U.S. television satire as Bill Maher and Al Franken.
</P>
<P>
   Participants are also likely to be treated to Huffington's
biting satire and newfound social conscience. She could read choice
excerpts from her diary, written as though from the White House
Lincoln bedroom, or from her new book _ her rich woman's epiphany
about the wealth gap and poverty in America. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ The Independent on Sunday didn't make it onto the
newsstands here in Beirut the weekend before last. Nor did Business
Week. Nor did the Economist. Or Newsweek. Or Time magazine. Or Le
Figaro. Or Le Monde...
</P>
<P>
   There was, it seemed, a little problem with the coverage of a
recent Middle East event: the death of President Hafez el-Assad of
Syria, whose memory was not always treated in the international
press with quite the respect it deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Independent's sin, it seems, was to have recorded the
genuine grief of Syria's citizens while noting the lack of black
flags in the ancient city of Hama where a 1982 fundamentalist
insurrection was bloodily repressed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Lebanese can read anything they want on the Internet,
the Surete Generale felt it necessary to explain the reason for its
censorship.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were well aware that articles could be read on
the Internet, the Surete said. But refusing permission for
offending publications to go on sale was a way of expressing the
government's ``moral disapproval.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities, an official statement added, had a duty to
counter comments which were disrespectful of the head of state or
``the head of state of a neighboring country.'' In other words,
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of conjecture as to whether the Syrians are as
frightened of criticism as the Lebanese are on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's government ministers have long accepted that foreign
journalists won't show the same respect as such giants of
journalism as Al Baath or the Syria Times. And Syria's new
heir-president, Bashar el-Assad, is fascinated by computers and the
Internet _ indeed, he was himself brought online by a Lebanese
communications expert.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the problem has nothing to do with the press.
It's about the relationship between Lebanon and ``Sister Syria,''
the presence of some 21,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon and the cozy
way in which Damascus and Beirut become ever closer.
</P>
<P>
   Take the telephone. Syria's international code is 0096311. But
in Beirut, I have only to dial 02 for Damascus. When I'm in
Damascus, I dial Beirut not through the international code 009611
but just 061. Overnight, the two capitals became just local calls
apart.
</P>
<P>
   True, Syria has not annexed Lebanon, as its critics would have
the world believe. The Syrians have not introduced their currency
to Beirut and the Lebanese _ not the Syrian _ flag flies over
government ministries.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Boulevard du President Hafez el-Assad near the
airport, there are plenty of highways dedicated to Lebanese
presidents and prime ministers. In Beirut, even the lunatic General
Michel Aoun _ who thought he was General de Gaulle when he launched
a war against the Syrians in 1989 but then ran like Petain for the
French ambassador's residence the moment the Syrians bombed him in
1990 _ can find his rantings printed in the Beirut press.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a certain amount of hypocrisy uttered about the
Syrians. I often hear the Lebanese complaining that their sons
cannot find jobs because of the presence of 400,000 Syrian guest
workers (or a million if you believe some) in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the Syrians can be found cleaning streets, selling bread,
washing houses _ menial jobs which the Lebanese have always refused
to do. If the Syrians weren't here, I suspect an army of Filipinos
would be forthcoming. There's already reported to be a legion of
240,000 Sri Lankan housemaids in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the cry from the Christian Maronites that with the
Israelis in retreat, it's time the Syrian forces also left Lebanon
_ a demand which conveniently forgets that it was the Maronites who
demanded the Syrian presence in the first place, and that the
mainstream Christian community never lifted a finger to oppose the
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrians, of course, remember 1982 and the Maronite
government installed by the Israelis _ Syria's troops and guns and
tanks are here to ensure that Lebanon does not again fall under the
sway of Syria's enemies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Lebanese and Syrian intelligence services work
closely together. There has even been a joint passing-out parade of
Syrian and Lebanese cadets.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not quite that simple. The treaty of brotherhood and
cooperation between Beirut and Damascus provides for Syria's
protection of her tiny neighbor in the event of ``Zionist
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that, while Syria may have saved Lebanon
from an Arafat-style capitulation to Israel, it clearly cannot
defend Lebanon from Israeli military attack. The Israeli air force
has eight times bombed Lebanon's power stations with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, needless to say, the Syrians tell you how grateful
the Lebanese should be, how many sacrifices Syria has made for
Lebanon _ a view not exactly reciprocated in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese, I suspect, have never gotten over the fact that
the Syrians _ who were cruelly regarded before the civil war as
backward and uneducated _ had to enter Lebanon when the
sophisticated, over-educated Lebanese tore themselves apart in
bloody internecine war.
</P>
<P>
   They forget, too, that an estimated 36 percent of the millions
of dollars invested in Beirut's banks is Syrian money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all goes back to the one-armed General Henri
Gouraud who carved ``Greater Lebanon'' out of Syria after the
1914-18 war. Before that, Beirut was a Syrian port.
</P>
<P>
   If you go up to the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli today,
you'll find thousands of families with relatives living in the
central Syrian cities of Hama and Homs, a reminder that back in the
aftermath of the First World War, most of the population of Lebanon
wanted to remain unified under the old Ottoman-style ``vilayet'' of
Damascus. Only the Maronites and the French demanded a new state.
</P>
<P>
   In the north of Ireland, another frontier was being drawn about
the same time. And around the new state of Yugoslavia. Thus did the
power and authority of the old mapmakers help to doom future
generations. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ I once bragged to a friend in Mexico that in the
United States we know the winner of a presidential election within
minutes after the polls close. That was nothing, he replied. ``Here
in Mexico we know almost a year before.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the joke may be on the Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), which has ruled Mexico by hook or by crook for seven
decades. Francisco Labastida, its presidential candidate, is
running neck and neck with Vicente Fox of the National Action Party
(PAN).
</P>
<P>
   Next week the PRI may need its mapaches, the so-called devious
raccoons who tamper with the votes. Or it can hope that Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, the third major candidate in the race, will be the
spoiler by siphoning off more than 15 percent of the votes, mostly
from Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter who wins the election, democracy wins.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico will finally have a vibrant multiparty system with an
opposition Congress, an independent judiciary and a free press _
developments that would have been unthinkable only six years ago
when President Carlos Salinas won approval of the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the groundbreaking treaty with the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Because of NAFTA, the whole world will be watching to see that
the elections are conducted fairly. It's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   When Fox drew even in the polls, Labastida exchanged his
``softly, softly'' approach for the more familiar PRI tactics of
vote-buying and coercion.
</P>
<P>
   He also called in the old guard, known popularly as the
dinosaurs, led by former Interior Minister Manuel Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett was accused of faking a computer crash to steal the
1988 presidential election from Cardenas and deliver it to Salinas
and the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, when polls showed that a PAN candidate for
governor of Chihuahua was leading by 3 to 1, the PRI manufactured a
victory for its man.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett explained that a PAN win would open the door to the
historic enemies of Mexico _ the church, the United States and the
business community. So if there was fraud, he said, it was
patriotic fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Because of NAFTA, Mexico can now afford the luxury of democracy.
Inflation is relatively low, commercial banks are on their way to
recovery and foreign debt is under control.
</P>
<P>
   With an export-led growth strategy, commerce between the United
States and Mexico has expanded by more than 150 percent to $220
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mexico replaced Japan (which has an economy 11 times
its size) as the No. 2 trading partner with America. In less than
10 years it will be numero uno, replacing Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has free trade arrangements with 28 other countries,
including those in the European Union. Given its history as a
protectionist economy, this is an extraordinary turnabout.
</P>
<P>
   These economic changes are affecting every aspect of life.
Within five years Mexican women will average two children, a sign
of a growing middle class. In 1975 women had a fertility rate of
six.
</P>
<P>
   New prosperity, zero population growth and fewer job seekers
will reduce the flow of illegal immigrants to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico still has a long way to go. Forty percent of its
population lives on less than $2 a day. Corruption and violence
have gone from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatista uprising in the remote southern border state of
Chiapas remains unresolved. And Mexico's multibillion-dollar
narco-trade with its addicted neighbor to the north is a powerful
destabilizing force.
</P>
<P>
   But because of NAFTA, these problems will be addressed
democratically.
</P>
<P>
   The next Mexican president will not be one of the new breed of
authoritarian-style leaders who have taken over in half a dozen
Latin American countries. These autocratic so-called populists, who
have assumed power through the ballot box, are ultranationalistic,
militaristic and impatient with the niceties of constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States wants to do more than pay lip service in
encouraging democracy in Central and South America, it should
negotiate an American Free Trade Agreement that extends all the way
from Canada to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   President Salinas remarked after the NAFTA vote: ``For the first
time ever, Mexico has a deadline for becoming more efficient. There
is no more manana.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting on July 2, Mexican democracy will not have to wait for
tomorrow, either. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The Nuclear Emergency Search Team _ the Energy
Department unit likened to a nuclear bomb squad that kept sensitive
information on the two computer disks that disappeared recently at
Los Alamos _ is a highly secretive outfit little-known to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   NEST, as it is called, was formed to allow a speedy response to
any credible report that a terrorist group might have planted a
nuclear device somewhere on U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   Its mission was given particular urgency, and its budget
considerably increased, in the aftermath of the Feb. 26, 1993,
terrorist attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   While that truck-bombing, using simple chemical explosives,
claimed six lives, a similar attack using even a small nuclear
device could have felled the towers and devastated the southern tip
of densely populated Manhattan Island, killing scores of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has thus built the capacity to fly a search and
response team of nuclear scientists and engineers, radiation
technicians and communications specialists to any spot in the
United States at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   NEST, at a remote corner of Nellis Air Force Base in a vast
installation in the desolate reaches of southern Nevada, keeps a
cargo plane ready on the tarmac, loaded with vans, generators,
communications equipment and highly sophisticated detection
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Its staff comprises volunteers from Nellis and also from the
national nuclear laboratories of Los Alamos and Sandia in New
Mexico and Lawrence Livermore in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Some are experts in nuclear-bomb-making, others in the
dismantling of nuclear devices. Their identities are kept secret,
as are those of Energy Department briefers on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   The department, which oversees the team, will reveal little
about how it does its work, in order not to provide unwitting
assistance to terrorists. Only rough outlines are known.
</P>
<P>
   One of the secrets most closely held about the group's work is
how it would disarm or neutralize a terrorist nuclear device. That
information was contained on the missing hard drives in the Los
Alamos lab.
</P>
<P>
   Such information might be useful to a terrorist group, allowing
it to booby-trap a nuclear device. But espionage at a level that
could penetrate America's most closely guarded laboratories would
seem far beyond the capacity of almost any terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   However, the disks also included data on U.S., Russian, French
and Chinese nuclear systems, useful to bomb-disarmers if a device
was based on such technology. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Could investing in Cuba become a reality in the near
future?
</P>
<P>
   For years, investors with a taste for exotic plays have had
their eye on the Caribbean island, in hopes that an easing of the
38-year U.S. trade embargo would provide a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hope has proved futile, but change may be in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The granting of permanent normal trading status to China by the
U.S. House of Representatives and the easing of trade sanctions on
North Korea makes American policy toward Cuba look outdated, say
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is growing from U.S. companies that want to export
everything from food to pharmaceuticals to the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   So how to take advantage of a possible easing in U.S. policy?
The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, run by Thomas J. Herzfeld
Advisors Inc., a Miami-based specialist in closed-end funds, is one
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, introduced in 1993, was originally called The First
Cuba Fund, but Thomas Herzfeld, the portfolio manager, said that
when it became clear that the embargo would not be lifted, it took
its present name with a mandate to invest in the region. It still
carries its original ticker symbol of CUBA.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cuba has no public companies, the fund invests in American
and international companies that stand to benefit from better
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must be able to do well, even with no change in
Cuba, but if there is, they would have a ``Cuba kicker'' Herzfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he owns Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Seaboard
Corp., which has an extensive commercial shipping network in the
region. The portfolio also includes Empresas ICA SA, the Mexican
construction company, and Puerto Rican Cement Co., likely
participants in rebuilding the country's crumbling infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Basin Fund is listed on the Nasdaq Small Cap
Market, and traded at about $5 on Thursday, at about a 1.5 percent
discount to the value of the fund's holdings.

   (UNDATED) _ Could investing in Cuba become a reality in the near
future?
</P>
<P>
   For years, investors with a taste for exotic plays have had
their eye on the Caribbean island, in hopes that an easing of the
38-year U.S. trade embargo would provide a windfall.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hope has proved futile, but change may be in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   The granting of permanent normal trading status to China by the
U.S. House of Representatives and the easing of trade sanctions on
North Korea makes American policy toward Cuba look outdated, say
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is growing from U.S. companies that want to export
everything from food to pharmaceuticals to the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   So how to take advantage of a possible easing in U.S. policy?
The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, run by Thomas J. Herzfeld
Advisors Inc., a Miami-based specialist in closed-end funds, is one
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, introduced in 1993, was originally called The First
Cuba Fund, but Thomas Herzfeld, the portfolio manager, said that
when it became clear that the embargo would not be lifted, it took
its present name with a mandate to invest in the region. It still
carries its original ticker symbol of CUBA.
</P>
<P>
   Since Cuba has no public companies, the fund invests in American
and international companies that stand to benefit from better
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies must be able to do well, even with no change in
Cuba, but if there is, they would have a ``Cuba kicker'' Herzfeld
said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he owns Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Seaboard
Corp., which has an extensive commercial shipping network in the
region. The portfolio also includes Empresas ICA SA, the Mexican
construction company, and Puerto Rican Cement Co., likely
participants in rebuilding the country's crumbling infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean Basin Fund is listed on the Nasdaq Small Cap
Market, and traded at about $5 on Thursday, at about a 1.5 percent
discount to the value of the fund's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Herzfeld also has a new offering, The Cuba Fund, which would
invest directly in the country. It had been in registration, but
was ``on hold,'' he explained. ``We have to file an amended
registration to bring it back to life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors with a heartier appetite for risk may want to consider
a single play on Cuba's flourishing tourism industry. Leisure
Canada Inc. has a joint venture with the Castro government to build
four luxury tourist complexes.
</P>
<P>
   While the projects sound promising, Leisure Canada's shares,

Canadian dollars ($15.10) last July to trade at 1.55 dollars on

   LONDON _ Standing next to the museum display, the warm eyes,
generous smile and smooth complexion of Phan Thi Kim Phuc make it
hard to believe she is the same person as the girl in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone old enough to remember the Vietnam War, the
photograph of the naked 9-year-old girl running toward a camera
screaming in agony as napalm burned her flesh is seared into the
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Her image has become a symbol of the barbarity of war that
transcends debate about the rights or wrongs of U.S. intervention
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Its iconic status also serves as a constant reminder to Kim Phuc
of the day in June 1972, when a U.S. commander ordered South
Vietnamese planes to drop napalm near her village in the Central
Highlands of South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the pictures and the documentary,'' she said, referring
to a film that was made of her life three years ago. ``That makes
me remember all the time. I saw the airplane. I saw the fire. I got
burned. I was so scared and crying and running out of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from trying to avoid the memories, Kim Phuc is proud of
the photograph and wants to see it exposed to future generations.
``Let the world see how horrible wars can be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, along with shots of the bombing and her initial
rescue by a television film crew, is going on display as part of a
$75.2 million extension of London's Science Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The new Wellcome Wing opens to the public next week, but Kim
Phuc and Nick Ut, the Associated Press photographer who took the
pictures and helped save her life, were in London Tuesday for a
formal opening of the extension by Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Phuc is not overtly political, perhaps understandably. After
being used as a propaganda tool by the Vietnamese government, she
defected with her husband, Bui Huy Toan, during a refueling
stopover in Canada on a flight from Moscow to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have freedom myself, and build my family,'' she
said. The couple live in Toronto with their two boys, Thomas, 6,
and Stephen, 3.
</P>
<P>
   She is happy to be an anti-war symbol, though. She was named a
goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) three years ago, and she has
established the Kim Foundation, which trains doctors and supplies
artificial limbs to help child victims of land mines in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move on to help each other,'' she said. ``I really
want to say, `Thank God I'm alive.' I want to forgive the people
who caused my suffering. I did.'' She laid a wreath at the Vietnam
Memorial in Washington in 1996 _ ``and so I am free from hatred and
bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   Ut, who took up a camera after his brother was killed as an AP
photographer, didn't hesitate to help 28 years ago. After shooting
the Pulitzer-Prize photo, he doused Kim Phuc's body with water and
drove her to a hospital. And he has kept contact through her
painful recovery, which included 17 operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saved my life,'' Kim Phuc said of the man she calls Uncle
Ut. ``He's wonderful, isn't he. I'm so grateful that he didn't only
do his job, but he's a human being helping another.'' &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Underground acquifers are diminishing on every
continent. Scores of countries face shortages as water tables fall
and wells go dry.
</P>
<P>
   Population increase means that 80 million extra people each year
need access to water resources. Nearly all the projected 3 billion
people to be added to the population in the next half century will
be born in countries that are already experiencing water shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Overpumping of water has occurred mainly in the last 50 years.
Only since powerful diesel- and electrically-driven pumps were
developed have we had the capacity to pull water out of aquifers
faster than it is replaced by precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of the water consumed worldwide is used for
irrigation. Another 20 percent is used by industry, and 10 percent
is used for residential purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly intense competition for water among sectors,
agriculture almost always loses.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 tons of water used in India to produce a ton of wheat
worth perhaps $200 can also be used to expand industrial output
that is worth 50 times as much.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanization and industrialization expand the demand for water.
As villagers in developing countries move to urban high-rise
apartment buildings with indoor plumbing, their residential water
use can easily triple.
</P>
<P>
   As people move up the food chain, consuming more beef, pork,
poultry, eggs and dairy products, they use more grain because
livestock and poultry are fed on grain.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. diet requires 800 kilograms of grain per person a year,
whereas diets in India, dominated by a starchy food staple such as
rice, typically need only 200 kilograms. Using four times as much
grain per person means using four times as much water to grow the
grain.
</P>
<P>
   Once a localized phenomenon, water scarcity is now crossing
national borders via the international grain trade.
</P>
<P>
   The world's fastest growing grain import market is North Africa
and the Middle East. Virtually every country in this region is
simultaneously experiencing water shortages and rapid population
growth.
</P>
<P>
   As the demand for water in the region's cities and industries
rises, it is typically satisfied by diverting water from
irrigation. The loss in food production capacity is then offset by
importing grain.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Iran imported 7 million tons of wheat, eclipsing Japan
to become the world's leading wheat importer. This year Egypt is
also projected to move ahead of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The world water deficit grows larger each year, making it
potentially more difficult to manage.
</P>
<P>
   If we decided suddenly to stabilize water tables everywhere by
simply pumping less water, the world grain harvest would fall by
some 160 million tons, or 8 percent, and grain prices would
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   If the deficit continues to widen, the pain and dislocation
caused by the eventual adjustment will be even greater.
</P>
<P>
   Unless governments in water-short countries act quickly, their
water shortages may soon become food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that the growing number of water-short countries
with rising grain import needs will overwhelm the exportable supply
in food surplus countries. Millions of people in low-income,
water-short countries will be trapped: thirsty and hungry, unable
to escape.
</P>
<P>
   There are still opportunities for developing new water
resources, but restoring the balance between use and sustainable
supply will depend primarily on reducing demand by stabilizing
population and making more efficient use of water.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward this goal is to eliminate the water
subsidies that encourage waste. The second step is to raise the
price of water to reflect its cost.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting to technologies, crops and forms of animal protein that
do not guzzle water offers huge potential for raising water
productivity. Such shifts will move faster if the price of water
more closely reflects its value. &QL;

 &HT;    Court was right in backing Miranda
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   That hissing sound you heard a few days back was the air going
out of a hope long pumped up on the political and social right that
if only the Miranda ruling could be wrestled back before a
conservative Supreme Court like the current one, it would be
overturned and that would show the crooks and liberals -- pretty
much one and the same _ a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   Oops. Steered through the Virginia-based 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals, made genial to such notions by Presidents Reagan and Bush,
the issue was indeed forced back to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   The happy result is a ruling that not only doesn't reverse
Miranda but fastens it into law more firmly than ever -- written by
no less than Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a root-and-branch
legal conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's emphatic presence in the majority was especially
deflating on the right. He had often said that if he had been on
the court at the time, he would not have voted for the Miranda
ruling, which advised criminal suspects of their rights to stay
silent and to legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But Rehnquist is more a straight-arrow conservative than a
reactionary activist like Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas, who were left sputtering together in volatile dissent. A
true legal conservative bows respectfully, though not slavishly, to
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was not, precisely, Miranda, but rather a law Congress
passed in panicky overreaction two years later attempting to
nullify the ruling. The law was widely counted so constitutionally
crippled that no administration ever wasted time trying to enforce
it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, as Rehnquist reminds us, can't just vote away
unpopular constitutional findings, and the 1968 statute could be
held valid only if the Supreme Court were prepared to scrap
Miranda. Rehnquist made plain it would do no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ought to give pause, but won't, to the various
ideological throwbacks _ from radio ranters to hyperventilating
activists _ who make political and financial livings out of never
letting a potent demagogic issue die.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda, to those ends, was vilified as coddling criminals and
making life impossible for cops, when in practice it shored up the
criminal justice system by making it fairer and by forcing a sharp
improvement in police work and prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Similar eternal campaigns are organized around efforts to send
women and doctors to prison for having and performing abortions and
to put Christian religious services back in public classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   All that is possible. The next president probably will name
three, maybe four, justices, and a change of just one Supreme Court
vote would start dismantling lawful abortion. And if the next
president appoints Scalia-Thomas look-alikes, as much George W.
Bush's constituency wants, we could be thrown into full legal
free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   How much better, as Rehnquist suggested, just to let sleeping
dogs lie _ especially the ones that have been dozing for more than
a generation.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Fidel re-nurtured
 &HT;    For release July 2, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Every once in a while, the Cuban-American community here
is smitten by erroneous reports that Fidel Castro has died. No such
thing. After 40 years of total control of Cuba, he is as alive as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   He's got his Elian back, he's got the Republican-led U.S.
Congress pushing through legislation to ease segments of the
embargo, he's got the Miami exile community in the most depressed
(and foul) mood it's even been in.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Rasputin quality to Fidel Castro. He can mesmerize
you into believing that he is a paternalistic messiah,
self-anointed to lift the values and lives of the world's oppressed
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he is one of the world's greatest oppressors.
</P>
<P>
   Many can be swayed by the sight of hundreds of thousands of
mothers in Havana marching in support of the return of Elian
Gonzalez, or of that entire school of children at the airport last
Wednesday to welcome Elian home.
</P>
<P>
   But there are cold, harsh truths about the rule of Fidel Castro,
truths that reach beyond just the thousands who take to rafts in
search of greater economic opportunity, truths that penetrate the
walls of his prisons where dissenters are incarcerated, where many
of the basic freedoms Americans take for granted (and celebrate
Tuesday) do not exist at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is granted that the Cuban exiles, particularly those that
dominate Miami, sometimes can be their own worst enemies, that many
of the things they say and do hurt their cause more than help it.
Certainly, the Elian Gonzalez saga was one of them; wrong battle,
wrong battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   But to those of us who have lived among them all these years,
there is a greater understanding, a better knowledge of what drives
their passions. No paramount ruler since Adolf Hitler has been able
to enchant both his people and others as has Castro.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades, he has taken advantage of the embargo first
imposed upon him by the Eisenhower administration, plus a series of
military and political foibles by John F. Kennedy, to blame all his
failures on U.S. policy. Nevermind that for the first three
decades, the Soviets were his sugar-daddies who kept him well-armed
but poorly fed and industrialized. Nevermind that since the Soviet
collapse, other nations have moved in and gone into joint venture
with Castro in re-establishing Cuba as a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the help he has received from elsewhere, the island
still is dominated by 1957 Chevys; i.e., nothing has trickled down
to the people.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the exile community often exaggerates the hardships of
Castro Cuba; they really aren't starving to death down there,
they're just not eating as well as those over here. And education
has improved since the Batista years; so have medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuba remains a closed society; no dissension, no free
enterprise, justice denied, no free press and only recently, a
slight lifting of religious oppressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian period, where Miami's exiles came out looking loony to
the rest of the United States, has given new verve to Castro. He,
as did Khrushchev decades ago, speaks with new bravado of burying
American capitalism, of continuing the crusade against us.
</P>
<P>
   And now, elements of the embargo are about to be lifted which
Castro will tell his people is a victory for their cause, when in
truth it is nothing more than lobbying American farmers and
pharmaceutical companies trying to create a new market for their
goods.
</P>
<P>
   How much has Castro left us incoherent and irrational? On the
day that Elian was returned to Cuba, exiles here continued (and
accelerated) their condemnation of the Clinton administration,
saying the return was but an effort by Clinton to improve relations
with Castro. At the same precise time, their hated Clinton was
standing at his podium in the White House saying that there never
could be a normalization of Cuba during his administration because
of the murder of Cuban-American fliers near Cuba several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This twisted discord, not goods, is what feeds the Rasputin of
the Caribbean.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GATES HITS THE E-BOOK CIRCUITS
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, July 2.

   REDMOND, Wash. _ Bill Gates, the squire of Redmond, where
Microsoft Corp. makes its home, has no use for computer manuals.
</P>
<P>
   Gates says the software programs that have made him a rich man
since he co-founded the company 25 years ago are much too complex.
The stuff that follows in the wake of Windows, he vows, will be a
lot more simple to use. It will also respond to intuitive voice
commands, making manuals superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Until that day, Microsoft will beef up its digital help
materials, making them accessible both within individual programs
and on line.
</P>
<P>
   Gates concedes that manuals are often useful to folks of a
certain age who learn best by turning the pages of a book. But he
is not alone in suspecting that quite a few of them are peddled to
bolster computer piracy, a fact of life in our cybertimes.
</P>
<P>
   In his new guise as Microsoft's chief software architect, Gates
dotes on all other kinds of books. All he asks, quite simply, is
that they be electronic books and that they run on Microsoft
software.
</P>
<P>
   E-books, as they are called in the publishing trade, are a hot
topic nowadays. Following the pioneering lead of Stephen King and
Michael Crichton, some authors salivate at the delectable prospect
of publishing directly on the Web without the need of hiring an
agent or having to kowtow to an imprint that offers the standard 10
percent royalty on sales.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, for most people reading on line is still no fun,
even if have great computer monitors. While mine are as good as
they come, nearly all of my non-research reading is done by turning
the pages of ordinary books.
</P>
<P>
   Gates thinks he's got a better idea. It's based on a device
known as a PC Tablet, which appears to be a major upgrade from the
$500 e-readers that Microsoft now markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we call ClearType,'' Gates said the other day in
the course of a drill he had staged for outsiders on where the
company wants to go tomorrow. ``When we talk about having the
quality of paper, can you believe how paper-like those fonts are?''
he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is an electronic book, and I can read along and see a
character,'' Gates went on in his best schoolmaster manner.
``Here's 'Baker,' a character that's introduced at this point. (To)
remind myself of when the character was introduced, it's simply a
matter of highlighting, tapping and it's done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and I can look up a word in as simple a manner as tap on
the word, tap on lookup, I see definitions for 'stretched,'
'stretching,' et cetera,'' Gates continued. ``A third tap and I'm
back reading with no visual artifacts, no clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Without much of a stretch, it seems as if Web print-on-demand
models and e-books are likely to shake up a business model that has
essentially remained static since post-Victorian times.
</P>
<P>
   If Charles Dickens, the Victorian-era novelist who first wrote
his ``books'' for newspapers, were to come back to life, it no
doubt would be as a Web author. And Bill Gates, no doubt, would
soon be signing him up for Microsoft.

COURT STRIKES DOWN NEBRASKA LAW BARRING PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reflecting the nation's deep and emotional schism
over abortion, the US Supreme Court Wednesday narrowly restated its
27-year-old affirmation of the right to choose by ruling that a
Nebraska law banning so-called partial-birth abortions is
unconstitutional and puts an undue burden on a woman's liberty to
end a pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched decision, the court's most important on the
issue in eight years and one sure to resound in the upcoming
presidential campaign, jeopardizes as many as 30 state laws enacted
to outlaw certain abortion procedures and could derail Congress's
effort this year to pass a partial-birth bill.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the 5-4 majority, said
Nebraska's law was unconstitutional on two counts: It lacked any
exception for protecting a woman's health, and it raised
``substantial obstacles'' to a woman obtaining a second-trimester
abortion because the wording of the ban was too broad and vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aware that constitutional law must govern a society whose
different members sincerely hold directly opposing views,'' Breyer
wrote, ``this court, in the course of a generation, has determined
and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic protection
to the woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Dissenting were
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy,
Antonin Scalia, and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights advocates marked a double victory as the court
in a separate case upheld 6-3 a Colorado law that prohibits
protesters, leafleters and ``sidewalk counselors'' from approaching
within eight feet of a patient attempting to enter an abortion
clinic, saying a protest-free ``bubble'' does not violate
free-speech rights. Rehnquist sided with the majority in this case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on partial-birth abortions, which Thomas deplored
from the bench as ``grievously wrong'' and morally indefensible,
brought both drama inside the chamber on the last day of the high
court's term and angry warnings from opponents on the plaza outside
that the ruling will not stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 5-4 decision reflects a radical expansion of the right to
abortion,'' James Bopp, general counsel of the National Right to
Life Committee, told reporters. ``The question before the country
is whether we are going to tolerate a system of invented rights to
abortion, and that question is going to be answered in large part
by the election in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates and foes of abortion rights both seized on the court's
action to remind voters that the next president is likely to name
one or more Supreme Court justices during his term, and that
nominee could easily tip the court's balance on abortion. Abortion
opponents took heart because Kennedy, who voted with the court
majority in the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which
said states can place ``no undue burden'' on a woman seeking an
abortion, switched sides and dissented in the Nebraska ruling in
Stenberg v. Carhart.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential candidates weighed in, too. Texas Governor
George W. Bush, the presumptive GOP nominee and an opponent of
abortions rights, said he was ``disappointed'' by the ruling and
``unlike Al Gore, I pledge to fight for a ban on partial-birth
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's spokesman, Chris Lehane, said the vice president supports
a woman's right to choose, including the right not to be forced to
undergo life-threatening abortion procedures. Lehane said it was
``particularly disturbing'' that Thomas and Scalia, who Bush had
called model justices, dissented from the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who twice has vetoed partial-birth abortion
bills, said during his news conference that he had ``pleaded with
Congress'' to include exceptions for the life and health of the
woman in its legislation. ``I think the court decision is clearly
the only decision it could reach consistent with Roe v. Wade,''
Clinton said, naming the 1973 landmark case that first affirmed
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The partial-birth case was brought to the high court by Dr.
LeRoy Carhart, a retired Air Force surgeon who began performing
abortions 1988 and runs a women's health clinic in Bellevue, Neb.
Carhart challenged the state's 1997 law, arguing that it was so
restrictive that 90 percent of the 5,000 abortions performed in the
state each year would be threatened. Under the law, physicians
convicted of performing outlawed abortion procedures would lose
their medical licenses and be subject to 20 years in jail and
$25,000 fines.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal district and appeals court ruled in Carhart's
favor, Nebraska Attorney General Don Stenberg brought the case to
the Supreme Court, where it was argued in April. Carhart, who was
at the court Wednesday, said he felt vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's opinion hinged, in large part, on an affirmative answer
to the clinical question of whether dilation and extraction, or
D&AMP;X, a second-trimester abortion procedure in which a doctor pulls
a fetus feet first through the birth canal and then crushes its
skull and empties its contents, is ever medically necessary to
protect the mother's life. ``We recognize that D&AMP;X may be safer for
some women,'' Breyer wrote, adding that decisions on appropriate
procedures must be made by doctors, not legislators or courts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor suggested that if Nebraska's statute had banned only
the D&AMP;X procedure and included an exception for the life and health
of the mother, ``the question presented would be quite different
than the one we face today.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his colleagues were missing the point. He said
Americans are so repulsed by these procedures, which he called
tantamount to infanticide, that they have supported bans in 30
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``From reading the majority's sanitized description, one would
think that this case involves state regulation of a widely accepted
routine medical procedure,'' Thomas wrote. ``Nothing could be
further from the truth. The most widely used method of abortion
during this stage of pregnancy is so gruesome that its use can be
traumatic for even the physicians and medical staff who perform
it.''

AFTER SEVEN TUMULTUOUS MONTHS, ELIAN GOES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old boy who survived a harrowing
journey at sea seven months ago only to be cast into the center of
an international diplomatic storm, waved goodbye to America
Wednesday and returned to Cuba in the arms of his father.
</P>
<P>
   The Gonzalez family took off in a chartered jet from Dulles
International Airport at 4:41 p.m., several hours after the Supreme
Court rejected a final appeal by the child's Miami relatives and
just 41 minutes after a lower-court injunction prohibiting Elian's
departure expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy to be going home,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez
told a crowd of reporters shortly before leaving the US with his
son. During his brief statement, most of which he delivered in
Spanish, the elder Gonzalez also thanked the American people for
their support and said he hoped the United States and Cuba could
achieve ``friendship'' in the future.
</P>
<P>
   On the tarmac of a small airport in Havana, where they arrived
about three hours later, Elian and his father were greeted by the
boy's four grandparents and a group of other relatives as hundreds
of flag-waving schoolchildren sang patriotic songs and chanted:
``Elian! Elian! Elian!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The little absent prince is coming back to his homeland,'' a
state television commentator said during the ceremony, which was
broadcast live across the island. Elian, who seemed to grow
comfortable with the ominpresent TV cameras and adoring crowds
outside his home in Miami, appeared far more shy as he waved
tentatively to the crowd in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   President Fidel Castro _ who has frequently accused his critics
in the United States of exploiting Elian, even as he has used the
boy to try to score political points of his own _ did not attend
the homecoming reception.
</P>
<P>
   The protracted custody battle over Elian captured Americans'
imaginations, seemingly as much because it involved a charismatic
child who had survived against enormous odds as because of the
emotional Cold War rhetoric that framed it. The case also grew in
prominence because it provoked heated debate about an array of
controversial issues, ranging from the 41-year US trade embargo
against Cuba to the fairness of American asylum procedures to the
role of fathers in their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most starkly, the ferocity of the tug-of-war over Elian
demonstrated to the rest of the country the deep hatred and
distrust Cuban-Americans feel toward their homeland's communist
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the home of Elian's great-uncle in Miami's Little Havana
section, where Elian spent most of his time in this country,
protesters wept Wednesday, denounced President Clinton for having
sided with Castro on the legal resolution to the case, and
expressed concern about the boy's fate in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad to see this young child go back . . . to a
country that's going to deprive him of his basic freedoms,'' said
Ninoska Perez, an official of the Cuban American National
Foundation. Ramon Saul Sanchez, president of the Democracy
Movement, said in a separate phone interview that he believed the
Clinton administration had orchestrated Elian's repatriation during
``secret dealings'' with the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   During a press conference before Elian's departure Wednesday,
the president said it would have been ``fine with me'' if Juan
Miguel Gonzalez had decided to defect to the United States with his
son _ as Cuban-American officials had repeatedly suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I wish it had unfolded in a less dramatic, less traumatic
way for all concerned?'' Clinton added rhetorically. ``Of course I
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's appearance on the world stage was a gripping and
wrenching story from the start.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, her boyfriend, and a dozen other would-be refugees
fled Cuba last Nov. 22 in a motorboat that sank as it approached
Florida several days later. Elian was found floating on an inner
tube off the coast of Fort Lauderdale on Thanksgiving Day, one of
just three Cubans to have lived through the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   After the boy spent several days hospitalized, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service granted temporary custody of the boy to
his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez. Elian's father quickly demanded
that his son be returned to him in Cuba, however, and the tug of
war began _ with most Cuban-Americans in Southern Florida backing
Lazaro Gonzalez and Castro supporting the Clinton administration.
The Miami relatives refused to follow INS orders that they give up
custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno took an unusually high-profile and
hands-on approach to the case, illustrating both the Clinton
administration's political sensitivity toward the influential
Cuban-American community and Reno's personal interest in a
melodrama that was playing out in the city where she grew up and
spent most of her professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Reno ultimately ordered federal marshals to seize Elian from
Lazaro Gonzalez's home on April 22 and return him to his father,
who had flown to the United States a few weeks earlier. Juan
Gonzalez, who was divorced from Elian's mother, stayed with his
son, his new wife and their baby in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,
from that time until their departure Wednesday from Dulles
International Airport in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law has provided a process, and this little boy now knows
that he can remain with his father,'' Reno said in a statement
after Wednesday's final judicial ruling clearing the way for Elian
to leave the United States. ``All involved have had an opportunity
to make their case _ all the way to the highest court in the land.
I hope that everyone will accept the Supreme Court's decision and
join me in wishing this family, and this special little boy,
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez was being observed by a television news crew
when he got word of the Supreme Court decision. He was looking out
at the ocean behind a church in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He turned angrily to the journalists and appeared ready to rush
at them as he shouted that they should leave. His daughter
Marisleysis, who described herself as Elian's surrogate mother
while he lived with the Miami relatives, pulled at her father's arm
and held him back.
</P>
<P>
   A family spokesman, Armando Gutierrez, told a news conference
after Elian had left the country that Lazaro Gonzalez and his
family were ``devastated'' by the boy's departure. The family had
repeatedly asked to see him since he was taken from their home, but
Juan Gonzalez said he would permit that only if they dropped their
legal fight, which they refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, a different argument held sway: that a
surviving parent has the legal right to make decisions for a minor
child _ including applying for political asylum _ regardless of
where he or she might live, unless there is evidence of abuse or
neglect. Indeed, most analysts agreed that the Elian episode would
neither have lasted so long nor achieved its high level of
prominence were it not for lingering Cold War sensitivities in this
country toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child of any other nationality stumbling over our border or
washing up on our shores would have been summarily shipped back to
his or her homeland without so much as a blip on the radar
screen,'' said Bernard Perlmutter, director of the Children and
Youth Law Clinic in Miami. ``This case has always been about the
relationship between the US and Cuba and about the power wielded by
the Cuban-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter and others interviewed Wednesday asserted that the
Cuban-Americans had likely undermined their political influence in
the long term with their adamant stand on Elian, mainly because it
differs so sharply from the view of most other Americans that the
boy belonged with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said they already detected that waning power
in the GOP leadership's expressed willingness this week to make
exceptions for food and medicine in the US embargo against Cuba.
``They still have a big voice, but their behavior on Elian . . . is
absolutely going to be seen as a turning point,'' said US
Representative Joe Moakley of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez and his family reportedly heard the news that they
could go home on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were elated, absolutely elated,'' said Christina Fitz, a
spokeswoman for Youth for Understanding International Exchange, the
student-exchange organization that provided a home to the
Gonzalezes during the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Fitz described the farewell message that Elian's father left to
his hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am leaving you with two Cuban flags,'' he wrote. ``One big
one and one little one as a token and the first step in the
direction of a human and beautiful relationship between our two
countries.''

SAMPRAS AILING AFTER DIFFICULT WIN OVER KUCERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A day punctuated by a parade of exclamation points
ended with a huge, ominous question mark hovering over the All
England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty involved Pete Sampras, who is trying to tie
Willie Renshaw's century-old mark for Wimbledon men's singles
titles (seven) and break the record he shares with Roy Emerson for
most Grand Slam singles crowns worn by a male (12).
</P>
<P>
   In a surprisingly arduous 7-6 (9-7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 second-round
victory Wednesday night over Karol Kucera, Sampras had his left
ankle taped and later took a tumble. Afterward, he was expected for
the customary postmatch press conference.
</P>
<P>
   But it was announced he would be unavailable because he was at a
hospital undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging of his inflamed
left foot, a condition that will be reevaluated Thursday. The
injury could jeopardize Sampras's scheduled match with Justin
Gimelstob Friday _ and halt his march toward history.
</P>
<P>
   The silence from Sampras resonated throughout the Wimbledon
grounds, which had been reverberating from the shock waves of the
day's earlier activities.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jolt was the departure of Magnus Norman, who is
ranked second in the world and third in this field. The
hardest-working man in tennis _ he's played more singles matches
than any of his colleagues this year _ Norman got a most unwelcome
breather because of a suffocating 6-4, 2-6, 6-7, 6-1 loss to
Belgian qualifier Olivier Rochus.
</P>
<P>
   The indefatigable Swede led an exodus of seeds that included the
No. 4 woman (Conchita Martinez) and the No. 6 and No. 11 men
(Cedric Pioline and Richard Krajicek, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, there were also two notable breaches of
etiquette by nonentities apparently intent on horning in on the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Tempestuous Jeff Tarango, who earned everlasting infamy when his
wife slapped an umpire here five years ago, this time avoided
contact. He refused the traditional postmatch handshake with his
opponent and fellow Stanford alumnus, Paul Goldstein, whom he
accused of dirty tricks at the end of their four-hour, five-set
grinder. The fact that Goldstein won the match was undoubtedly
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   And Anna Smashnova provided a unique twist on spousal disputes.
Nagged from the stands by her opponent's husband during her
three-set win over Katalin Marosi-Aracama, Smashnova fired a ball
at him _ but instead skulled a female spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras's situation superseded all that, much to his dismay. The
top seed already had a gimpy back when he launched his Wimbledon
defense, and he was clearly struggling against Kucera, whom he had
beaten in five of six previous meetings. As dusk descended on
Centre Court, there were doubts Sampras would have time to dispose
of Kucera. After the third set, there were doubts he would have
enough healthy body parts to survive Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   Leading, 5-2, in the third set, Sampras called an injury timeout
while a trainer treated his ankle. Then while making a lunging
volley for set point, he slipped and fell to the turf. He rolled
over and winced but quickly regained his footing, then finished the
job against Kucera. It remains to be seen whether he'll be on the
job against Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sampras went to the emergency room, Norman was
nursing a severely bruised ego. Two weeks after finishing as
runner-up in the French Open, he couldn't handle an occupant of the
rankings netherworld (No. 179) who needed to win a qualifying
tournament in Portugal last week just to get on the grounds here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my first win with a Top 100,'' said Rochus after causing
the ruckus. ``Today I beat the No. 2. It's great, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman would disagree. Often dismissed as a dull workaholic, he
entertained the Court 1 crowd with quite a demonstration of
self-disgust.
</P>
<P>
   After being broken to 5-5 in the third set, he made a
ferociously authoritative bounce pass toward the stands. It would
have gone over great in the NBA Finals, but unfortunately for
Norman, he was abusing the tennis racket that was betraying him.
</P>
<P>
   After surviving the set by taking five straight tiebreaker
points for a 7-4 verdict, Norman was hapless in the finale. But at
least he wasn't humorless.
</P>
<P>
   Called for a foot fault while serving at 5-0, Norman, who had
disputed several rulings, plaintively walked over to ball girl
Lauren Graham, handed her his racket and three tennis balls, and
implored her to take his place at the service line. Flustered, she
nonetheless fulfilled his request, lofting two soft underhand lobs
to Rochus's side of the court before dumping the third into the
net. Then Norman reluctantly reclaimed the racket. He won that
game, then netted a return of serve on Rochus's second match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing so poorly, so I thought, `Hey, she's going to do
better than me,' '' said Norman. ``She actually did.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Norman had company among those who did badly.
</P>
<P>
   Poetic justice prevailed when Krajicek didn't. The 1996
Wimbledon king was evicted from Centre Court by Wayne Ferreira,
5-7, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6. Ferreira had expressed sympathy for the three
highly ranked Spaniards who had withdrawn from the tournament
because of Wimbledon's abitrary pecking order, which had
disregarded their world standings and deprived them of any of the
16 seeds. Ferreira's protest was more tangible because his victim,
Krajicek, had been one of the prime beneficiaries of Wimbledon's
whims, elevated from his No. 27 world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline, the 1993 US Open and 1997 Wimbledon runner-up, lost a
heartbreaker to Vladimir Voltchkov, 6-3, 6-3, 2-6, 3-6, 6-4.
Pioline just turned 31 but dismissed the notion age had done more
damage to him than Voltchkov had.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose form, whatever, if you are 15 years old or 50
years old, it's the same,'' he said. ``Doesn't matter which age you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was another casualty on a terrible afternoon for French
Open runners-up. Like Norman, her male counterpart in Paris,
Martinez _ who won here in 1994 _ was ambushed by an unknown,
Canada's Sonya Jeyaseelan, 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't . . . it hasn't sunk in yet,'' said Jeyaseelan.
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, was Wimbledon's theme of the day.

 &HT;    The boyfriends: Where my daughters go, boys follow
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I've reached a new stage in my relationship with
my now-grown daughters. The oldest is a college graduate now
looking for a job making mega-bucks but willing to settle for
enough to pay her rent and car note, now that she's been downsized
from the patriarchal payroll. The youngest is a sophomore who is
only tangentially aware of the real world of bills and financial
obligations and has no intention of delving further into this
sphere until it's absolutely necessary. They live together in
Austin, a four-hour drive from here, which I believe to be an ideal
distance from one's grown children. It's close enough to make
weekend visits possible but not so close they're showing up every
weekend to cadge your food and use your washing machine and
gasoline card.
</P>
<P>
   I have survived dealing with my daughters' numerous car wrecks
and other late-night crises. It now appears altogether likely that
neither child will be sentenced to a lengthy prison term _
certainly always a victory for a parent and never a sure thing. The
youngest plans on being a famous writer of movie scripts and plays,
and I would not be surprised if she accomplished her goal. The
oldest has more modest but no less-worthy goals, to be a speech
therapist. Life is good. Now I must learn to adjust to the constant
presence of:
</P>
<P>
   THE BOYFRIENDS.
</P>
<P>
   I am possibly looking at my future sons-in-law _ at least one
and maybe both. Who knows? Jason and Matt are nice-looking, polite
kids with whom I have a decent relationship, meaning that I haven't
threatened them with bodily harm if they lay a hand on my
daughters. I have come a long way since my girls first started
dating, and I interrogated each beau while maintaining a cool,
gruff demeanor at all times and a shotgun in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's... whatever. You're grown, you're gone. I am no longer
in control, not that I ever was to any degree.
</P>
<P>
   The key change in the past year or so is that the daughters do
not return to East Texas without the boyfriends. When I visit
Austin and invite them out to eat, guess who else is coming to
dinner? The boyfriends, of course. The boyfriends are ever-present,
both members of the UT band who live in the same apartment complex
as my daughters. I have no interest in further information and
details.
</P>
<P>
   I am not complaining, understand. As I said, both are pleasant
young men who like golf and music and willingly carry on
intelligent conversations with people twice their age, which puts
them a cut above most previous beaus. My mother thinks the
boyfriends are adorable and keeps pushing my daughters to get
married and presumably have babies so she can be a
great-grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what that would make me, besides even more broke after
paying for a wedding? ``Grampa Gary'' does not have a pleasant ring
to it, at least at the moment. I would like to at least reach the
half-century mark before that happens, though I have remarkably
little say into all this.
</P>
<P>
   The constant presence of the boyfriend is preparation for the
Next Big Change, which is taking on the title of father-in-law. At
the least, I hope there is a decent interval between receipt of
that appellation and that Grampa Gary thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'm resigned to it. From now on, a visit from the girls will
include boyfriends and later husbands, who may or may not be the
same young men sitting on my back porch last weekend, drinking my
soda waters and waxing poetically over my grilled burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Then a crop of babies will appear. I will be Grampa Gary for the
rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I've already warned the boyfriends: Don't even think about
calling me Dad. My given name will do just fine.

 &HT;    Democrats may come to regret decision to leave 2000 ballot open
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ralph Nader's formal designation last weekend as
the presidential nominee of the pro-environment, anti-corporate
Green Party has the chance to be a real problem for the Democratic
nominee, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But for Texas Democrats, 2000 is just the beginning of the
problem. Fast-forward to 2002, which Democrats, who once ruled
Texas, have earmarked as a rebuilding year. They plan to field a
full ballot and hope to recapture some of the statewide offices
they have lost to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party could be the Texas Democrats' worst nightmare _
and the Democrats don't seem to realize it yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats did not field candidates against incumbent
Republicans for several statewide offices. The Greens plan to field
candidates for some of them, including two seats on the Texas
Railroad Commission and a slot on the Texas Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they get on the ballot. The Greens this spring
launched a signature-collecting campaign to do so. They had to
collect 37,380 signatures of registered voters who did not vote in
either the Republican or Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   To be on the safe side, the Greens presented 75,911 signatures
to the Texas secretary of state's office, which oversees Texas
elections. Those signatures have been sent back to counties where
the voters reside to be sure they're eligible to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Hanshaw, director of the legal division for the
secretary of state, says that accounting should be finished by late
July _ and the Greens should learn by Aug. 1 whether they've
achieved ballot status.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, they've got candidates poised to run for the
statewide positions the Democrats chose not to contest: Gary
Dugger, an Austin United Parcel Service driver and son of Texas
Observer founder Ronnie Dugger, for the Railroad Commission seat
held by Charles Matthews; Charlie Mauch, an environmental engineer
from Houston, for the Railroad Commission seat held by Michael
Williams; and Ben Levy, a Houston lawyer, for the Supreme Court
seat held by Nathan Hecht.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the problem clicks in for the Democrats: If the
Greens get 5 percent in just one statewide race, they're
automatically qualified for the ballot in 2002, without having to
gather petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the past performance of third-party candidates in races
where only one major-party candidate is on the ballot, the Greens
will get at least 5 percent in one of those races _ if not in all
three. The Libertarian Party candidates have done so in election
after election since 1986 in races for seats where either Democrats
or Republicans failed to run.
</P>
<P>
   In several statewide races over the years _ including
gubernatorial wins by Democrat Ann Richards in 1990 and Republican
Bill Clements in 1978 _ the victor got less than a majority. That
was because of third-party candidates drawing some of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   So in 2002, presume that the Greens field candidates for
governor, lieutenant governor, the U.S. Senate and other offices
down the ballot. Again, if the past is a predictor, even in races
where both parties are represented, third-party efforts can draw of
2, 3, even 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And they're more like to come off the Democrats' tallies, given
that the Greens are represented by folks such as populist Dugger,
who ran for the Railroad Commission as a Democrat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats Paul Hobby for comptroller and John Sharp for
lieutenant governor lost their races by less than 1 percent in
1998. In 2002, a left-leaning Green candidate could make things
even tougher for Democrats in close races.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party Chair Molly Beth Malcolm predicts the
Greens won't bother the Democrats in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always welcome an open honest debate on issues, because
that's a healthy part of democracy,'' Malcolm said. ``But I don't
think it's going to have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Texas voters ``will see that we're supporting issues
that are important to Texans _ public education, health care and a
balance between a cleaner environment and moving this economy
forward. But we sure do want to have clean air to breathe and clean
water to drink _ that's important for the economy as well. And that
can be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Malcolm's optimism, if the Democrats lose a few points
to the Greens in 2002, they're going to wish they'd run a full
ballot in 2000.

 &HT;    Sacrificing student safety, performance on UIL altar
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Someone refresh me why Waco High School needs that
5A by its name.
</P>
<P>
   So it can compete with Temple in football once a year, and
Odessa Permian once every other decade, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Is that enough to put a pinch on student performance and to hand
administrators untenable crowd-control issues?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently. Apparently Waco needs to show how big it is.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Waco school trustees discussed the so-called
importance of 5A was over the question of magnet A.J. Moore Academy
offering University Interscholastic League sports and other
activities. It has no UIL sports, and Waco High's potential loss of
5A designation was the biggest reason why any such option was
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the size of Waco High, roughly 2,000 students, became
an issue with concerns that halls were hard to monitor, classes
were way too large, and several teachers had to float without their
own classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers also cited an odd modern-day condition: a few students
who played hooky but didn't leave the building, shuffling from
restroom to restroom to cafeteria to cubby-hole, anywhere but
class.
</P>
<P>
   Things should be better this year, space- and numbers-wise. The
completion of the new performing arts building will create limited
classroom space. Additionally, A.J. Moore will welcome its fourth
freshman class, its final complement, siphoning additional students
away.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope that these two ingredients are the vents that allow
people to breathe at Waco High. But we should not be satisfied just
to breathe in and out.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is indisputable that smaller groupings of students
produce better conditions, whether in a classroom or in a student
body. That coin has two sides, of course. At some point ``smaller''
means sacrificing class options. A median can be found between too
large and too small.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year study out of Chicago urges the pursuit of that median
_ a shift away from bigger schools _ something Waco voters
essentially did this year at the middle school level by approving a
new middle school to relieve overcrowding at University Middle.
</P>
<P>
   But even within a large campus like Waco High there are ways to
make things more intimate. One of the best ways is with
subgroupings.
</P>
<P>
   Many have observed that the addition of freshmen two years ago
brought challenges not experienced when numbers were close to the
same and the school had only three grades.
</P>
<P>
   One approach seems obvious, then: Create a largely
self-contained ninth-grade wing. Do everything possible to make
ninth-graders feel part of a group, rather than grains of sand
sprinkled on a vast beach. Administrators discussed this last year.
They must follow through. Middle schools do this routinely,
insulating sixth-graders to the extent possible from, say,
eighth-graders who are growing facial hair. It helps. It matters.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly is one thing Waco High needs, some
community-building among newcomers who otherwise get lost in the
shuffle.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, though, Waco High would have even fewer students. Yes,
that might mean sacrificing 5A status. A.J. Moore should be the
outlet. A modest increase in its capacity, roughly to 900 (capacity
now is 680, which it will come close to meeting), would benefit
both schools. A student body of 900 would merit more program
options. Ideally, A.J. Moore would have UIL sports, making it easy
to attract enough students and to cement itself as a full-fledged,
full-service magnet high school.
</P>
<P>
   A question, Waco: Any problem with ideal? If pitting Waco High
vs. Permian every other decade is your idea of ideal, question your
priorities.

 &HT;    An honest election in Mexico? It could happen
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY -- If Mexico's ruling party wins the July 2
presidential election, who would believe the results? Certainly not
the army of critics of the Party of the Institutional Revolution
(known by its Spanish acronym of PRI). The PRI has held power in
Mexico for seven decades, but in the last couple its stranglehold
on the Congress is weakened considerably. The PRI has lost its
monopoly on governorships and local offices to the point where some
PRI-istas are quick to note that they are an opposition party, not
a dominant one.
</P>
<P>
   ``One half of Mexico is governed by parties other than the
PRI,'' Rosario Green, Mexico's foreign minister, noted during a
conversation with a delegation representing the American Society of
Newspaper Editors. It was her way of saying that there is political
competition in Mexico and has been, contrary to the stereotype that
clings to the country.
</P>
<P>
   In days past, the PRI was pretty shameless in the way it
manipulated elections. The culmination was 1988 when Carlos Salinas
de Gortari was locked in a close race with challenger Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas. During the vote count, the computers went down
mysteriously and when they came back up, Salinas and PRI had won.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky guy, no? Actually no. Later, there were widespread reports
of electoral fraud, but Salinas kept the presidential sash.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has
pushed and prodded -- often over howls of protest from his own
party -- for what Mexicans call transparent elections. His critics
note that Zedillo may have had little choice in the matter and
credit a persistent opposition for electoral reform.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever gets the credit, there is little doubt that the process
is a clean one.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are issued registration cards with their photo and a
computer bar code on them to prevent individuals from voting early
and often. Moreover, the thumbs of people who vote are dipped in
black ink that is impossible to remove for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Carrillo, an official of the independent federal election
commission, also explained that representatives of each party are
present when election judges open ballot boxes to count votes.
</P>
<P>
   He described intricate security on the electoral computer
system. There is not a system that can't be beaten, but you have to
go a long way to scam this one.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's going to happen if Francisco Labastida, the PRI
candidate, wins July 2 in a squeaker ?
</P>
<P>
   No doubt you'll hear accusations of fraud. And those will have a
receptive audience given the long history of chicanery in Mexican
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the fact that there is a question about the outcome
reflects a sea change in Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that the contest between Labastida and Vicente Fox,
the nominee of the National Action Party (PAN) is tight. The
country is ready for change, it is thought, and change is what Fox
pitches. In retort, Labastida claims his candidacy represents
change with a purpose -- a jab at Fox, who can be quite
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Lund, who has been conducting polling in Mexico for many
years, cautions against jumping to too many conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Women, a growing influence in Mexican politics, are attracted to
Fox's message but are wary of the messenger, Lund said.
Furthermore, Mexicans are conservative by nature and wary of rapid
change, Lund observed. That might work in the PRI's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Those are but a couple of logical reasons that indicate that the
PRI could win legitimately . Mexicans love irony, and there is
nothing more ironic than the PRI's past casting a shadow, long and
deep, over an election the party could well win honestly.

<P>
   KILLAMS POINT, Conn. _ One midday, years ago while traveling in
Spain, I was sitting in a Madrid bar watching a bullfight on
television. A handsome and gallant young man had dispatched the
bull, which lay dead on the arena floor. Hailed as a future great,
the matador was taking his bows before the cheering crowd when the
bull suddenly stirred to life _ not with a few wearied motions, but
with great vigor, rising violently up and abruptly goring the
matador to death.
</P>
<P>
   This scene was replayed again and again on Spanish TV, for just
a few moments before, the noble youth had stood triumphantly over
the beast.
</P>
<P>
   I think of this because in some ways the aforementioned scene
seems analogous to what has happened, again and again, with regard
to relations between Fidel Castro's Cuba and the exile community in
the United States. Just as it seems that the revolution is on the
verge of a defeat, it rises again. In the instance of the Elian
Gonzalez affair, the noble matador is the Cuban exile community
which, for the most part, strongly supported Elian's staying here.
(I say ``the most part'' for I have spoken to some Cubans who
believed he should be returned to Cuba with his father.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the child's arrival here, his future has been an
emotionally loaded issue; Elian's situation has seemed to embody
the Cuban exiles' longstanding belief that freedom, as Americans
know it, is preferable to life in a socialist state; that the very
circumstances of Elian's survival, with its mythical overtones, had
foretold an uplifting and morally sound outcome; that justice would
be done.
</P>
<P>
   Now that this little boy, Elian, has returned to Cuba with his
father, the notion of justice will long be debated, and ``political
expediency'' will color the dialogue. I, for one, will be glad to
see this affair fade as subject matter for the monologues of Jay
Leno and others: what has happened is not funny. The exiles are
sincere and impassioned in their beliefs; they have had only the
best intentions for the child and for the future of Cuba itself.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of freedom is beyond passion for those who have felt
deprived of it; seeking freedom is greater than a one-minute
segment on the evening news, and not about cheap and easy jokes on
morning radio shows. As a kid I lived in a New York City household
that became a home to family that had left Cuba, and although I'd
like to think I have a balanced and ``sophisticated'' view of
history, I will never forget how my relatives endured and overcame
the difficulties of the exile life. That triumph, I believe, is
something that the Miami relatives of Elian wanted to share with
him: what other responses could they have had?
</P>
<P>
   The exiles _ from Holguin, Santiago, Havana and every small town
in Cuba _ are, in a sense, a family. All they have sought to give
this child is a life among them.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that a perpetual corrida is taking place in the
divided community of Cubans, here and on the island. This affair
with Elian has been but one instance in a history of antagonisms.
It is unfortunate that the situation exists at all. The Cubans are
a great people _ in this instance they are both ``bull'' and
``matador'' _ and reconciliation, not continued disappointment,
should be a mutual goal for the future, whatever sadnesses may
ensue.

   ``Phenomenally, phenomenal woman, that's me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Oprah Winfrey at her ``Personal Growth Summit'' in Detroit on
June 23.
</P>
<P>
   Mark your personal growth calendars, people, for we have reached
the moment when Oprah Winfrey has officially crossed the transom
from world's largest ego to flat-out having a messiah complex.
</P>
<P>
   This is the conclusion I've come to after immersing myself in
all things Oprah for an entire day.
</P>
<P>
   First I checked out some newspaper clippings, notably an
excellent story in the Ottawa Citizen about Oprah's ``Personal
Growth Summit'' in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering the arena, each member of the audience received a
tote bag containing a nightshirt, inspirational candles, skin
cream, mascara, lipstick and two chocolates, along with a green
journal embossed with a gold ``O'' and a courtesy-of-Microsoft
silver pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write this down,'' Oprah reportedly commanded her flock. ``You
become what you believe. You. Become. What. You. Believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Segments from Oprah's show were played, including the testimony
of a woman who bought a pair of Oprah's shoes at a charity sale:
``I bought her shoes and kept them under my bed, and when I got
really, really depressed, times when I didn't have anybody to talk
to, I took out the shoes and I ...''
</P>
<P>
   At this point the woman breaks down and cries.
</P>
<P>
   Now then. You'd think that any mere mortal would cringe and say,
``I'm sorry, but that's so misguided of you, to use my shoes as
inspiration. Only Jesus should be worshipped that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Oprah. She tears up and says, ``Stood in my shoes. To make
herself better she would stand in my shoes. And now she doesn't
have to stand in the shoes as much because she's ... standing on
her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Good God. How can a human being, even one who has accomplished
so much, get to a place where she could believe such tripe about
herself?
</P>
<P>
   I turned from the clippings to the ``Oprah'' show on TV, just as
she was introducing the ``Spirit'' segment, featuring author Denise
Linn, who explained how a bedroom can ``feed one's soul'' if you
can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bedroom is my sanctuary,'' she said. ``It's the place where
I can connect with my spirit ... It's important to have space
underneath the bed, to have a sense of clarity, even if it can't be
seen. Our subconscious mind is aware that directly beneath our body
is a lot of disorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the April issue of Playboy and a dust bunny the
size of a catcher's mitt.
</P>
<P>
   Next I turned to the latest issue of O magazine, with Oprah on
the cover in a $920 pantsuit ensemble and Bach platinum earrings.
</P>
<P>
   She's on a sailboat. Looking like she doesn't spend a lot of
time on a sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of O had 14 pictures of O. This one has 12. Not
counting the five pictures of Oprah on O subscription cards.
</P>
<P>
   I flipped past the ``Live in the Moment'' calendar (July 28:
``This day, have no regrets'') and read Oprah's article about the
``Spa Girls,'' a group of friends who gathered at Oprah's farm for
a week of exercising, dieting and beauty treatments, augmented by
in-person counseling from Oprah's chef, Oprah's personal trainer,
one of Oprah's favorite motivational speakers, etc. In other words,
just the sort of thing a working mom can relate to.
</P>
<P>
   From there I turned to Oprah's web site and read this posting:
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest way for me to connect to my spirit, to connect
with the capital WHO of who I am _ not Oprah Winfrey talk show
host, not Oprah Winfrey actress, not Oprah Winfrey whatever the
image, is through meditation ...''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. You have to be dazzled by such unapologetic
self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   And now I'm starting to dive into Barbara Kingsolver's ``The
Poisonwood Bible,'' the latest selection of Oprah's Book Club. All
I can say for sure is I don't think Jim Carrey will be optioning
it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact I could spend the rest of the week reading
Oprah-recommended materials, trying Oprah-recommended diets and
workouts, lighting Oprah-recommended candles, listening to
Oprah-recommended speakers, purchasing Oprah-recommended items _
but we all know I'm never going to join the Church of Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what some have claimed, I don't ``hate'' Oprah. I don't
hate anybody. There is much to be admired in this woman. She has
used her monumental wealth and power to help thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   But she's a contradiction with every breath she takes in public
_ basking without humility in her own glory while also trying so
desperately hard to find inner peace through meditation and diet
and candles and quotes and resolutions and workouts and, and, and
... it never stops.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could take her out for a couple of beers and a load of
laughs with some regular people, I really do. I wish she could see
that you don't have to be the center of attention and you don't
have to strain so much to find a few hours of happiness in this
world.
</P>
<P>
   And yeah, I wish people wouldn't find spiritual inspiration from
her shoes.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I've reached a new stage in my
relationship with my now-grown daughters. The oldest is a college
graduate now looking for a job making mega-bucks but willing to
settle for enough to pay her rent and car note, now that she's been
downsized from the patriarchal payroll. The youngest is a sophomore
who is only tangentially aware of the real world of bills and
financial obligations and has no intention of delving further into
this sphere until it's absolutely necessary. (Gary Borders is
editor and publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ MEXICO CITY -- If Mexico's ruling party wins the
July 2 presidential election, who would believe the results?
Certainly not the army of critics of the Party of the Institutional
Revolution (known by its Spanish acronym of PRI). The PRI has held
power in Mexico for seven decades, but in the last couple its
stranglehold on the Congress is weakened considerably. (Arnold
Garcia is editorial page editor of the Austin American-Statesman)
MOVEDMCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Ralph Nader's formal

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Last year the size of Waco High, roughly 2,000
students, became an issue with concerns that halls were hard to
monitor, classes were way too large, and several teachers had to
float without their own classrooms. The evidence is indisputable
that smaller groupings of students produce better conditions,
whether in a classroom or in a student body. That coin has two
sides, of course. At some point ``smaller'' means sacrificing class
options. A median can be found between too large and too small.

COMPANIES FEUD OVER STORAGE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as it increased the target price for its initial public
offering, StorageNetworks Inc. of Waltham, Mass. has disclosed a
nasty dispute with one of its main hardware suppliers, EMC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, of Hopkinton, Mass., is the leading producer of disk-drive
assemblies for big computer databases. StorageNetworks buys
equipment from EMC and others, then leases out the capacity to
corporate customers like banks and e-commerce providers.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the two companies have insisted their operations are
complementary, although StorageNetworks has received investments
from such EMC competitors as Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But strains have emerged as StorageNetworks prepares to go
public, while EMC sorts out its relations with the company and
other startups known as ``storage service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   In filings to securities regulators this week, StorageNetworks
described a letter it received from EMC on June 21. The letter
accused StorageNetworks of pretending EMC has invested in the
company, misappropriating confidential EMC data and hiring away EMC
employees in violation of the contracts, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   EMC has threatened to sue, the companies said, though EMC
spokesman Mark Fredrickson wouldn't describe the basis of the
allegations. StorageNetworks executives called the charges false
but wouldn't say more, citing securities rules.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute may cause EMC to terminate contracts,
StorageNetworks said in its filings. Last year, its work as an EMC
subcontractor accounted for about 40 percent of StorageNetworks'
total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Lost revenue could be disruptive to StorageNetworks, which plans
to spend $100 million this year, and $700 million by 2005, building
a fiber-optic network to its storage systems worldwide. Because of
those expenses, the company said that it expects to lose money
``for the foreseeable future.'' The company had an accumulated
deficit of $51.5 million as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that warning, StorageNetworks also increased the price
range for its initial public offering, usually an indication of
strong interest from investors. The new range is $23 to $25 a
share, according to a filing Wednesday, up from the $17 to $19 a
share range the company had previously targeted. StorageNetworks
wouldn't discuss its reasoning for the price increase.
</P>
<P>
   About 9 million shares in the company will be sold, according to
the filing, which would raise more than $200 million at the higher
share price. The company's officers and directors would still
control 68 percent of the company following its IPO,
StorageNetworks said. The IPO is expected in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks is just one of a host of companies being created
to offer remote-storage services, challenging the business model
for EMC and others who have traditionally sold their gear directly
to users. In May, EMC said it will spend $1 billion over several
years to market and support its products to the new storage-service
providers. EMC has also made minority investments in some of the
companies aiming at consumer markets, including i-drive.com,
X:drive, and SkyDesk.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, StorageNetworks is well known partly because
its management includes former EMC employees, among them Peter
Bell, the StorageNetworks chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Webster of the Illuminata Group, in Nashua, N.H.,
suggested the close ties may have fanned the competition between
the two companies, however. He noted a StorageNetworks' director
and shareholder, Harry Dixon, was previously a top EMC sales chief
before leaving in January for reasons neither side will discuss.

 &HT;    PANNING BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME: Expensive attraction's slow
start confuses some, angers others
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ Emerging from the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, David Owens said he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, that's it,'' fumed Owens, whose annoyance was
stimulating a powerful desire for a cigarette. ``I'm embarrassed as
an Englishman, as a European and as a human being. They spent
untold millions on this and at the end of the day it's money down
the pipe, isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Body Zone is perhaps the best known of the 14 themed sectors
in the Millennium Dome, the US$1.2 billion attraction intended to
make an important statement about modern Britain at the dawn of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the midpoint of the Dome's troubled life, the
statement being delivered is not exactly what its backers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who paid about US$100 for a family ticket, waited 30
minutes with his wife and twin 5-year-olds to enter the colossal
peach-colored, androgynous body. The journey began with a view of a
giant naval _ pierced stylishly with a huge ring _ continued with a
ride up an arm past the thunderous pounding of a giant heart, a
talking brain, a Volkswagen-sized eyeball and then down the stairs
and out the leg.
</P>
<P>
   After finally lighting up and taking a thoughtful puff, the best
thing Owens could say about the experience was that it was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, five minutes?'' he asked his speechless wife. ``I can
withstand anything for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Britain must withstand six months more of the misery
generated by the ill-fated Dome since its inauguration on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Dome quietly welcomed its 3 millionth visitor.
That's the good news. The bad news is that the attraction's
managers last year projected that the Dome would have 12 million
visitors for the year that is now half over.
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing opening in January the projections were
slashed to 7 million _ a figure that may still be elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Slow ticket sales have had the predictable effect on the bottom
line. Losses are reported in the British media to be already more
than US$150 million. In May, the government had to come up with a
nearly US$50 million emergency cash injection to keep the doors
open. The government intends to sell the Dome in July to a private
bidder. At the end of the year, it is to be reconfigured into some
other use.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun, Britain's largest selling tabloid, reported earlier
this week that the Dome would run out of money in September and
close four months early _ an assertion that the Dome's management
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the most recent group of managers, headed by
EuroDisney veteran Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, acknowledges that the
earlier attendance estimates were wildly optimistic and that the
Dome has been slow to work its way into the public's heart.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, a Frenchman who speaks with an American accent, blames
much of the problem on the British press, which has been gleefully
merciless in its attacks on the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gerbeau used an appearance at Parliament to appeal
for less vitriolic coverage. ``Why don't you stand behind us for a
change and let us prove ourselves to the general public,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome's new advertising campaign urges the public to ignore
the press. A new television spot casts Dome critics as sheep and
ends with the line, ``You've got a mind of your own _ take it to
the Millennium Dome.''
</P>
<P>
   However, people seem to be taking their minds elsewhere. In a
nagging coincidence, the new and much acclaimed Tate Modern museum
also marked a milestone Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Open just seven weeks a few miles up the River Thames, the Tate
welcomed its millionth visitor and is on a pace to become London's
surprise top attraction for the year.
</P>
<P>
   This can be explained by two important factors: the Tate is free
and in central London. A ticket to the Dome is more than US$30 and
the structure is set in a car-free zone on former industrial land
about 15 miles east of London.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, many observers believe the Tate provides the smart
and funky experience promised but not delivered by the Dome.
Stephen Bayley, who resigned as creative director of the Dome
before its opening, believes that the Tate has been well-received
because it appeals to the public's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People so wanted something intelligent, smart and optimistic
and now it seems as though it is Tate Modern that has supplied
that,'' Bayley said. ``The Tate does not characterize the British
public as drooling morons, whereas the Dome insults with
patronizing rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dome is a national disgrace, a catastrophically expensive
lesson and we should all be ashamed. The dimwits responsible should
be publicly stoned.''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a number of resignations, no one has been
stoned _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   Dome designers say they meant to appeal to the masses and are
dismissive of complaints that they dumbed down the exhibits. ``We
have been accused of having low standards and pandering to the
lowest common denominator, but I don't apologize for that at all,''
Ben Evans, one of the Dome's four content editors, said in a recent
BBC radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be family-orientated and to be inclusive, not
exclusive, and ensure that as many people as possible could come
and enjoy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The 14 zones within the huge Teflon-roofed structure _ which is
twice the size of the Georgia Dome _ were intended to illustrate
human life, work and play as well as the social and environmental
challenges of the 21st century. Unlike Disney's Epcot Center, the
exhibits are not rides but rather strolls, climbs or meanderings
through the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Body Zone, the Dome offers such attractions
as the Journey Zone, which chronicles the history of
transportation; the Money Zone, which invites visitors to spend
vast sums and watch the inflationary effects of their extravagance;
and the Faith Zone, which represents various forms of religious
worship.
</P>
<P>
   Some zones may seem peculiar at best to a visitor. Living
Island, which faithfully replicates the Spartan pleasures of a
British beach, offers a fine collection of what can be best
described as washed up garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Other sectors are more successful. The Play Zone has a variety
of entertaining family games, and the Self Portrait Zone, with its
thousands of photographs contributed by ordinary and famous
Britons, makes a fine national time capsule.
</P>
<P>
   The Dome also seems to fare better with conventional
entertainment. Each day, the Millennium Show provides a stunning
extravaganza of dance, acrobatics and high-wire theatrics in the
Dome's cavernous central arena.
</P>
<P>
   Impressively, the Dome also offers the largest McDonald's
restaurant in the world _ an odd feature in an attraction intended
to celebrate modern Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Dome's standing as favorite target for the city's
journalists, comedians and artsy class, it nevertheless does seem
to please many of its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Loren Keene, who also exited the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, said she was impressed. ``I'm quite weary with all the
comments in the press,'' she said. ``I think this is a bright and
cheerful place, and many of the exhibits are brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Dome's managers constantly remind everyone that
their studies show that people who actually see the Dome enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Gerbeau, the Dome's chief executive, believes he will achieve
the revised target of 7 million visitors, which would place it
among Europe's most popular attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any standards, the Dome is clearly an overwhelming success
both in terms of visitor numbers and the positive feedback from
those who visit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, many visitors may share the reaction of French
President Jacques Chirac, who had only one question after seeing a
model of the Dome in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's it for?'' asked a puzzled Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   The answer still isn't completely clear.

 &HT;    PANNING BRITAIN'S MILLENNIUM DOME: Expensive attraction's slow
start confuses some, angers others
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (l) Lifestyle categories.

<P>
   GREENWICH, England _ Emerging from the Body Zone on a recent
afternoon, David Owens said he had seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right then, that's it,'' fumed Owens, whose annoyance was
stimulating a powerful desire for a cigarette. ``I'm embarrassed as
an Englishman, as a European and as a human being. They spent
untold millions on this and at the end of the day it's money down
the pipe, isn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Body Zone is perhaps the best known of the 14 themed sectors
in the Millennium Dome, the US$1.2 billion attraction intended to
make an important statement about modern Britain at the dawn of the
new century.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the midpoint of the Dome's troubled life, the
statement being delivered is not exactly what its backers had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who paid about US$100 for a family ticket, waited 30
minutes with his wife and twin 5-year-olds to enter the colossal
peach-colored, androgynous body. The journey began with a view of a
giant naval _ pierced stylishly with a huge ring _ continued with a
ride up an arm past the thunderous pounding of a giant heart, a
talking brain, a Volkswagen-sized eyeball and then down the stairs
and out the leg.
</P>
<P>
   After finally lighting up and taking a thoughtful puff, the best
thing Owens could say about the experience was that it was brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, five minutes?'' he asked his speechless wife. ``I can
withstand anything for five minutes.''
</P>
<P>

HISTORY ASIDE, `PATRIOT' A SPECTACLE TO BEHOLD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they make films about the birth of our nation that try to
be thoughtful, like ``Revolution'' and ``Jefferson in Paris,'' the
results tend to be very bad. So now they've made one where thinking
is a secondary consideration, if even that, and the outcome is, if
not really better, at least rather fun.
</P>
<P>
   The key image in Roland Emmerich's long, unwieldy and resolutely
superficial ``The Patriot'' is not of Mel Gibson waving various
early combinations of red, white and blue, nor even of his face
covered in crimson blood to evoke fond memories of the Pictish
warpaint he wore in the just as dumb but cooler ``Braveheart.'' No,
the telling shot here is of a Continental soldier's head getting
knocked off by a British cannonball. It nicely encapsulates the
film's anything-for-an-effect ethos and, of course, symbolically
comments on the filmmaker's opinion of the picture's perfect
audience (right before the decapitation, there's a subjective shot
of the projectile barreling right at us). &QL; 
The rest of the movie is more subtle, if only incrementally. But
Emmerich, whose gift for action staging and visual splendor
counterbalances his tendencies to simplify and pander, often sweeps
us along with pure spectacle. ``The Patriot'' is a gorgeous film _
just, like too many pretty things, more emptier than it aspires to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's Benjamin Martin is a South Carolina widower with seven
children and _ in a flagrant attempt to avoid anything resembling
honest or, God forbid, complicated social history _ a plantation
worked by ``free'' blacks. Of course, Frances Marion, the
Revolutionary figure Martin is clearly based on, was as fervently
committed to slavery as he was to killing redcoats, an attitude
likely shared by most of his fellow Southern landowners in the 18th
Century.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a different, contradictory movie, and the last thing
a filmmaker like Germany's Emmerich _ whose usual speed is pop
culture pastiches like ``Independence Day'' and the ``Godzilla''
remake _ wants to do is challenge anyone's complacency. So Martin
is not only incredibly ahead of his time, racial
enlightenment-wise, he's also All About Family.
</P>
<P>
   Which we all know is really important. Maybe the most important
thing. Along with, maybe, freedom and stuff. And paying fewer
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   See, even though he was a holy terror in the French and Indian
Wars, Martin is reluctant to join the rebellion for the sake of his
children. He's also, it's bludgeoningly hinted, a little worried
about turning back into the brutal killer he became in the earlier
conflict. Indeed, it's the same psychic no-man's-land Clint
Eastwood explored so brilliantly against the backdrop of frontier
capitalism in ``Unforgiven,'' and it would have been very
interesting to examine how that kind of violent nature fit into the
idealistic struggle to create the first modern democratic republic.
</P>
<P>
   But nah, Martin only goes Mad Max when despicable Brits
terrorize his kids, which essentially lets him off any ethical
hook. With his Cherokee tomahawk and ragtag band of backwater
militia, Martin essentially invents modern guerrilla warfare and
harasses an uncomprehending Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson,
self-parodying stuffiness with a deft intelligence that comes from
a whole other movie) all the way from Charleston to Yorktown.
During downtimes between ambushes, of which there are plenty,
Martin bonds with his oldest son/second-in-command Gabriel (Heath
Ledger, another Aussie), makes tentative passes at his just-waiting
sister-in-law (Joely Richardson, who is English) and tries to get
his mute youngest daughter to say she loves Daddy (I think the girl
who plays her might actually be American).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to well-meaning, slightly psychotic family man
Martin, the main British villain, Reinhard Heydrich ... er, that
is, dragoon Col.William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), likes to ride
around the countryside slaughtering entire communities at a time.
While such depredations have certainly accompanied military actions
from Carthage through Mongol invasions to the Thirty Years War,
you'd think that if such Nazi-like atrocities had occurred during
our war of independence, they might have made their way into the
national lore before now. Really makes you dislike Tavington,
though, which, it could safely be argued, was the point.
</P>
<P>
   So, you wonder, what on Earth is right about ``The Patriot''?
Good gory battle scenes, first and foremost (the raid Martin takes
two of his youngest sons _ the only allies around who can handle
muskets _ on is particularly chilling). Though not quite as
visceral as ``Braveheart's'' best, nor as appallingly wasteful as
the point blank exchanges in the Civil War drama ``Glory,'' they
convincingly evoke the futility of fighting superior forces with
conventional methods. Conversely, we're given a clear understanding
of how imagination and surprise can be a general's greatest
weapons. Plus, all those blue and red uniforms blood-up real
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nice ration of sly humor to counterpoint the grim
and sentimental goings-on. ``Patriot's'' script is credited to
Robert Rodat, whose screenplay for ``Saving Private Ryan'' had its
share of detractors, but compared to this melodrama, it clearly
stands out as a rigorous and complex study of men fighting the good
fight despite what it does to them.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``The Patriot'' is cartoon history, at least it's full of
color and motion like a good cartoon should be. Enjoy the
spectacle, let the cheap emotions touch you if they can ... but
don't forget to duck that cannonball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The film: ``The Patriot'' (R; violence, language, children in
jeopardy.) &QL;

Joely Richardson, Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo. &QL;

WILL OSCARS GET ANIMATED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Goes with June Foray story) 
By RODNEY RICHEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While she still loves doing voices for animation, one of June
Foray's most passionate drives these days is regarding animation.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime member of the Board of Governors for the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, she is advocating a new
category for the Academy Awards: Best Animated Motion Picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although animated films do qualify for the Best Picture
category, it is very unlikely that one could win against, say,
`American Beauty,' '' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Foray adds that such a category, if approved, would be an
occasional one, brought out only when a sufficient number of strong
animated features had been released.
</P>
<P>
   That is a sticking point with the board, says John Pavlik,
director of communications for the academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have 10 animated feature films in a year, but none of
them is any good, and yet the number 10 triggers an automatic
nomination for two or three of them, that doesn't seem quite
fair,'' Pavlik says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, if you go much beyond that, you're sort of
making a nomination impossible (given the number of animated films
released).''
</P>
<P>
   That the academy would be recognizing feature animation,
however, might spur increased production, Pavlik adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the goals in coming up with the Academy Awards
in the first place: trying to get producers to really think about
coming up with a quality product.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sticking point is a complex one: What constitutes an
``animated'' feature? Foray's ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' contains both animation and live action.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question that the board will have to address,''
Pavlik says. ``How much (animation) has to be in a film before we
call it an 'animated' film?''
</P>
<P>
   The absolute earliest such an award could be instituted would be
for the awards given out in 2002. The last new category added was
Best Makeup in 1964 (as an occasional award). The periodic award
for Best Visual Effects, established in 1936, was made an annual
award in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the academy, Pavlik says, does not like to add categories
and dilute the value of the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it would be a popular award,'' Pavlik says
of the proposal. ``The audience would enjoy it, and I think the
industry would enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a revered veteran of animation, from its Golden Age to the
present, Foray feels a sense of duty in pushing this cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are an art form,'' she says. ``It used to be that Disney
was the only one making these, because ... Disney was the only one
with the wherewithal and the money. But there's been such an
explosion of interest in animation from DreamWorks, 20th Century
Fox, Warner Bros., and even foreign films,'' Foray says, citing
Japan's recent ``Princess Mononoke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People love animated films, and they do make money. At least
there would be a category for them, and they would have the
opportunity of winning.'' &QL;

<P>
   Making a movie from a cartoon short (or a ``Saturday Night
Live'' sketch) is usually a bad idea to begin with, simply because
what works for five minutes can rarely be stretched over the
duration of a feature-length film.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that the makers of the latest dud in this genre,
``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' would have learned this
lesson, if only because somebody else already tried to mine Jay
Ward's cartoon factory eight years ago with the big-screen bomb
``Boris and Natasha.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' takes a great many things for
granted. Chiefly:
</P>
<P>
   1. That an audience remains for the kind of good-hearted,
pun-driven hokum that fueled Ward's popular animated shorts during
their early '60s heyday, and ...
</P>
<P>
   2. That no one has seen either of the ``Austin Powers'' movies,
whose plots are essentially recycled here.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a misfire that tries to please everybody _ kids,
nostalgic boomers and series fanatics _ and ends up satisfying no
one. The film's self-referential, insider humor will fly over the
heads of children, while its tangle of tepid subplots will put
adults to sleep. It's just one big _ pardon the godawful pun, but
then that's the spirit of the enterprise _ ``moose-stake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' opens promisingly enough with the
faithful Narrator bringing us up to date on the happenings in
Frostbite Falls since the original series was canceled in 1964. It
seems our heroes have been more or less suspended in the 1960s
(``yeah, baby!''), as have their villainous counterparts, Fearless
Leader (Robert De Niro) and the bumbling spies Boris (Jason
Alexander) and Natasha (Rene Russo).
</P>
<P>
   The film's lively opening moments, completely animated, burst
with wit and originality and sharp fun, which dissipates at about
the mark that an old ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cartoon would end.
Then Fearless Leader and his cohorts somehow make their way into
the real world, where Fearless plans to turn Americans into zombies
via his omnipresent cable network, RBTV (Really Bad Television).
</P>
<P>
   A plucky pixie of an FBI agent, Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo,
all lips and dimples), is assigned to find Rocky and Bullwinkle and
enlist their help. It's pretty dull sledding from here, although a
few comic bits connect, such as a ``Cops'' spoof and watching De
Niro riff on his Travis Bickle persona by way of Dr. Evil.
</P>
<P>
   But De Niro is barely in the movie. We also see very little of
Alexander and Russo and too much of Perabo, playing a character
that never should have been in the movie to begin with, much less
given the lead role. It's a sign of the movie's misplaced
loyalties, which are heightened by Kenneth Lonergan's clunky
screenplay and Des McAnuff's inept staging.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news: Lonergan is reportedly working on the screenplay
for another Ward cartoon, ``Sherman and Peabody.'' Can somebody
step into the Way-Back Machine and stop him before it's too late? &QL; 
---The film: ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' (PG; cartoon violence). &QL; 
The stars: Piper Perabo, Robert De Niro, Jason Alexander, Rene
Russo. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Des McAnuff. Screenplay by Kenneth
Lonergan. Released by Universal Pictures. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 26 minutes. &QL;

THE MOOSE IS LOOSE, AND ROCKY GETS SQUIRRELY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
ART OF JUNE FORAY AVAILABLE 
 
 
By RODNEY RICHEY  
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When June Foray greets you at her Woodland Hills home, your
first impression is that she could be somebody's sweet,
white-haired granny.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, you hear ``Hokey smokes, Bullwinkle!''
</P>
<P>
   The voice is unmistakable. Yes, beneath that granny exterior is
Rocky the Flying Squirrel, pal to the gangly, bumbling moose.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jay Ward's enduringly popular cartoon ``The Adventures
of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' went off the air in 1964, Foray, a
voice-over legend, has never stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   But now she's back as the voice of flying squirrel in the new
Universal release ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' which
opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The new film is a blend of live action and animation directed by
Tony Award-winner Des McAnuff (``Big River,'' ``The Who's Tommy'')
from a script by Kenneth Lonergan (``Analyze This''). It stars the
very live-action Jason Alexander as Boris Badenov, Rene Russo as
Natasha Fatale and Robert DeNiro, who also produced the film, as
Fearless Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Foray calls the original series, which ran from 1959 to 1964,
``one of the most sophisticated, mordantly witty series that's ever
been on the air. And it wasn't mean-spirited in any way.''
Nevertheless she was thrilled to reprise Rocky in a big budget
feature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that, if they had called somebody else, I think the
whole world would have been disappointed,'' Foray says, with all
due modesty. ``It wouldn't be Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   The original show's co-creator, Bill Scott, who was the voice
ofBullwinkle, died in 1985; so comedian Keith Scott (no relation)
has taken over for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always taken aback when I work with June in a recording
studio,'' Scott says from his native Australia. ``There is always
that childlike moment _ 'Wow, I'm in the same booth with June
Foray. Pinch me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Foray and the younger Scott first performed the voices together
during a recording session in 1992, for a Universal Studios Theme
Park street show. It was the first recording of the voices since
1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sent shivers up and down my spine,'' says Tiffany Ward,
daughter of the series' late co-creator Jay Ward who has also
turned her dad's ``George of the Jungle'' and ``Dudley Do-Right''
properties into features.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 
3,5!tag!At the beginning of the movie, Rocky and Bullwinkle are in
retirement, puttering around their house and ``not even getting
residuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe, though, that June Foray has been puttering around
her Woodland Hills house all this time, waiting for ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' to come around again. She has never stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent Thursday, she had returned from doing the voice of
a witch, Magica De Spell, for a Disney CD-ROM, only a week after
post- production work as Granny on a new Warner Bros.
direct-to-video feature, ``Tweety's High-Flying Adventure.'' Then
there were the CD projects with Rhino Records.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, Foray (who will only cop to being ``over 50'' though
she's been listed as 81) receives her star on the Hollywood Walk of
Fame, only the second cartoon voice performer to receive such an
honor. (The other is the late Mel Blanc. Other voice performers who
have stars, including Casey Kasem and ``Rocky'' regular Hans
Conreid, received them for other aspects of their careers.) Foray
also received a lifetime achievement award at the World Animation
Celebration earlier this month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Her career, which has included voicing characters like Cindy-Lou
Who in the original TV cartoon version of ``How the Grinch Stole
Christmas,'' Lena Hyena in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' and, more
recently, Grandma Fa in Disney's ``Mulan,'' even included the neat
trick of providing the voice for Mattel's Chatty Cathy doll, then
parodying that voice as an evil ``Talking Tina'' doll in an episode
of ``The Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime friend, ``Laugh-In'' announcer Gary Owens, said that
voice performers all over the city were planning to shut down work
the morning of July 7 to attend the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is so spectacular and so deserving of this star,'' Owens
said. ``People just love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens will be one of the speakers that day, along with Steve
Allen, legendary animator Chuck Jones and comedy icon Stan Freberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond versatility, she's just a great actor,'' says Freberg.
``People think, 'Oh, well, she does voices.' Forget voices. That's
just a tool of the actor. The basic thing that June is, is a great
actor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 
3,5!tag!Much of this acclaim has taken the former live-action
actress by surprise. She had intended on a career in films, perhaps
working with her husband, the late TV and screenwriter Hobart
Donavan (``Escape to Burma''). She had even written a children's
radio series, ``Lady Makebelieve,'' as a young performer. (Those
rediscovered original scripts form the basis of her ``Tall and
Small Tales'' stories, on audio cassettes via Amazon.com and Barnes
&AMP; Noble.)
</P>
<P>
   Voices, however, are her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems I've always been popular, but was unaware of it,''
she says. ``I get thousands of fan letters, from all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of the fondness that her colleagues have for Foray
comes from her willingness to help others. She has taught
voice-over acting at such venues as USC and The Learning Tree and
occasionally furnishes voices for student films and teaches
voiceover acting to inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I can, I like to do that,'' Foray says. ``It justifies
my own success.''
</P>
<P>
   That success is the big surprise, though. It was during her
recent recording session at Disney that June Foray again
encountered the fame she never expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost embarrassed. There were all these young people
there, and they said that it was such a thrill and honor to meet
me. And I've been getting that lately, and it's truly humbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if it weren't for these people, I probably wouldn't
be where I am today. I'm very grateful. I've been an extremely
fortunate human being.'' &QL;

POWERFUL RE-CREATION OF KILLER STORM COULD USE A COMPASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first half of ``The Perfect Storm'' doesn't resemble an
adaptation of a 1997 bestseller so much as it does a 1957 World War
II movie. We meet a sensitive but tough young man who's about to
leave his woman in port, promising her that this will be the last
time he goes out to sea on a dangerous mission; a jocular guy who's
leaving behind his adoring young son from a broken marriage; a
goofy dude who's on a romantic losing streak; and a taciturn,
reluctant seaman with a chip on his shoulder, especially when it
comes to the jocular guy. And they all respect their beloved
skipper, even if he is an arrogant cuss.
</P>
<P>
   These all sound like stock characters _ and they are _ but
they're based on real people, the ones so well-limned in Sebastian
Junger's acclaimed book about a swordfishing boat that gets lost at
sea as a hurricane, a tropical storm and a cold front converge in
the North Atlantic, creating ``the perfect storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors are, of course, part of the same shorthand that's
necessary when adapting a long, complex book into a two-hour movie.
If you need a charmingly arrogant determined-rebel sort to play
swordfish-boat skipper Billy Tyne, who better to turn to than
George Clooney? For the sensitive lovebird with a hard side, throw
in Mark Wahlberg, who is beginning to find his niche with this role
after similar turns in ``The Big Hit'' and ``Three Kings.'' For a
sad-souled joker, pull in John C. Reilly, ``Magnolia's'' lonely
police officer. William Fichtner, a familiar face but a
less-familiar name than Wahlberg or Clooney, plays the hardcase,
and Austin's John Hawkes steals what scenes he can as the
loser-at-love. Allen Payne has the most underwritten role as the
boat's lone Jamaican.
</P>
<P>
   This is the crew of the ill-fated Andrea Gail, but not only do
we get these courageous, likable men, we also get their women back
on the mainland, best exemplified by Diane Lane, who has the
thankless job of having crying jags and screaming fits as
Wahlberg's distraught lover. There's still more. The Coast Guard
sloop rescue, a key portion of the book, becomes a thrilling part
of the movie _ only to have director Wolfgang Petersen continually
cut away from it to go back to the Andrea Gail. Only the parallel
story of Tyne's more sensible fishing partner/rival Linda Greenlaw,
whose role is expanded from the book, has much flesh on it, and
that comes largely thanks to the solid performance of Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who must be yearning for a nice romantic
comedy after the grueling shoots for this and last year's
underrated ``Limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd problem with the movie: It has a short attention
span, constantly jumping us from one subplot to another, but it
also wants us to be patient, waiting for more than an hour for the
storm of the title. But then, an even more curious thing happens:
The storm comes in, and virtually blows all the movie's flaws away.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``blows'' is too weak a word. The storm sequence,
which lasts a good 40 minutes or so, is the most bludgeoning,
mind-shattering, teeth-rattling, nerve-racking set piece since the
D-Day battle in ``Saving Private Ryan.'' It has glitches, but it
simply powers right by them, so that you don't think about them
till later. In fact, the storm doesn't give you much time to think
at all: You're too busy watching the towering, digitally enhanced
waves tossing around the poor Andrea Gail and its hapless crew, or
ducking from the screen as plywood, anchors and masts fly at you,
or cringing as a Coast Guard helicopter tries to rescue a misguided
sloop and then has to attempt to refuel in midair during gale-force
winds.
</P>
<P>
   The storm sequence is, indeed, near-perfect, another stellar
example of the almost preternatural knack for action that Petersen
has shown in movies as varied as ``Das Boot'' and ``Air Force
One.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm sequence is so overwhelming that the placid sea that
comes afterward is not enough to calm the nerves. Of course, it
also isn't enough to soothe any bristling toward the movie's often
overwrought sentimentality. Make no mistake, though _ if you're
going to ``The Perfect Storm,'' you're going for the storm, and
it's smashing in the literal and metaphorical senses. If only the
rest of the movie weren't so imperfect.

signed with China to convert an Ilyushin into a modern radar plane
showcased the company's strengths. But if the Pentagon has its way,

 &HT;    At Daytona, turn on the lights!
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla _ The night NASCAR event at Daytona is
special for several reasons. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   1. Rare off day on Sunday. This race is one of four in the
Winston Cup Series held at night, and so it offers a welcome Sunday
off for everyone in the sport. An informal check with more than 20
drivers and owners has discovered near-unanimous support for more
Saturday-night races in future schedules. Getting that extra day
off becomes all the more important when NASCAR adds two more events
to the season in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   2. Beat the heat. Before lights were installed at Daytona
International Speedway, the Pepsi 400 was run in the morning,
initially with a 10 a.m. start and later an 11 a.m. green flag.
With the drivers raving about the lighting system in Charlotte,
officials at Daytona decided to make the move to night racing in
the summer of 1998. With the heat and humidity, every driver would
agree that an 8 p.m. start makes for much comfortable conditions
for the drivers, crews and fans.
</P>
<P>
   3. Better racing. When the Pepsi 400 was run in the middle of
the day in years past, many races would feature a two-car breakaway
for the lead. The problem was that, even though drafting was
critical at DIS, the intense heat made the track surface slippery,
which put a premium on handling. Unless caution flags flew at the
right time, the cars would string out along the 2.5-mile speedway.
At night, the racing surface is much more forgiving on a
less-than-perfect handling car, compared with the day-time
conditions. Also, some drivers have said they have better
visibility at night compared with day-time conditions.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bright paint schemes. In general, fans enjoy night racing
better than day-time action for reasons including the way the cars
shine and sparkle under the light. Most one-time paint schemes are
pulled out for The Winston at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte,
but several teams usually show up at Daytona in July with a
different look under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Worst things about Daytona night-racing
</P>
<P>
   1. Brutal scheduling. The Winston Cup Series was delayed by rain
one day in Pocono last week. Teams had to scramble back to North
Carolina and immediately load to head to Sonoma, Calif. Then, they
turned around to face a short week, because they have to be in
Daytona for qualifying Thursday night. Those poor hauler drivers.
</P>
<P>
   2. Local tracks. With the Pepsi 400 schedule and with many race
fans staying home to watch it, a lot of local short tracks across
the country are forced to cancel their Saturday-night events this
weekend. It is sort of a ``Catch-22'' situation: Winston Cup night
races hurt attendance at local tracks, which develop the talent
that eventually ends up on the major-league circuit.
</P>
<P>
   3. Traffic and parking. This problem also is relevant to the
Daytona 500. For years, many fans had parked free at the Volusia
County mall across from the speedway, but the mall is going to
start charging next year. With the increased seating capacity,
ticket holders do not have enough parking on speedway property.
Vendors across the street behind the Winston Tower were charging
$50 for a parking spot on private property on the day of the
Daytona 500. Daytona Beach also is a popular destination for
vacationers on the fourth of July weekend, which adds to the
traffic tie-ups in front of the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Hotels. The track is located just off I-95, while most motels
are located five to eight miles away on the beach. With the
vacationers, the demand for lodging is high, which translates into
big bucks for a place to stay. Also, with many young non-race fans
out cruising late at night, a glut of traffic is heading from the
speedway to the beach at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   5. No support race. This event is the only one on the circuit
that does not feature a support race, such as Busch, Craftsman
Truck or ARCA. Many fans that attend races like to make a full
weekend out of the activities and attend Cup qualifying, the
support event and then the Winston Cup event. With Cup qualifying
Thursday night, Friday is pretty much a scratch, with all concerned
preparing for Saturday night. Perhaps NASCAR should consider
running a support race of some type on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Prime time, baby
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Pepsi 400 was the first Winston Cup event shown live
at night on network television from start to finish. The Pepsi 400
never will approach the importance of its sister event _ the
Daytona 500 in February _ but the excitement of night-racing in
front of a national television audience is intriguing for everyone
involved.
</P>
<P>
   With the new TV contract starting in 2001, this weekend's race
marks the end of CBS's affiliation with Winston Cup. CBS played a
vital role in the growth of the sport, most notably with its
memorable coverage of the 1979 Daytona 500, which captured the
fascination of the country with Cale Yarborough brawling against
the Allison brothers _ Donnie and Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise relief
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti and Tony Stewart proved that drivers have short
memories _ fortunately. The two sides have been at odds since last
year's Martinsville race, when Stewart was in the middle of his
infamous quarrel with Kenny Irwin and caused Andretti to wreck. As
a result, Richard Petty said, ``Tony needs to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Stewart became frustrated when Andretti's lapped
car appeared to be slowing him down through traffic at the end of
the Pocono race. Guess who was the relief driver for Stewart at
Sears Point? Surprisingly, it was Andretti, who rescued the Home
Depot team by rallying to finish 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace shows class
</P>
<P>
   Fans can criticize Rusty Wallace for failing to capitalize on
six poles, but the veteran driver was a hero to many in the racing
community with his post-qualifying comments at Sears Point. Wallace
said he felt ``like an idiot'' for taking away the pole from Kyle
Petty, who is still mourning the death of his son, Adam. It was a
refreshing and touching moment for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   `DW' deservers more respect, says Waltrip's little brother
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip's farewell tour, dubbed ``Victory Tour 2000'',
has been a rough ride for the veteran driver.
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip's initial goal for his 29th and final season on the
Winston Cup circuit was to win at least one race. Unfortunately for
Waltrip, it is considered a victory whenever he is able to qualify
for a race.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 races, Waltrip has had to use provisionals to make the
field five times and missed three races altogether. It has been an
embarrassment for the former three-time Winston Cup champion and
his team.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Michael Waltrip thinks his older brother deserves more
respect in his final season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching Pebble Beach the other day and Jack Nicklaus
was making what was maybe his final appearance in the U.S. Open,
and he was struggling home. He got in on an exemption, and they
said it could be his last one,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about our sport, and I say, why can't people be
talking about Darrell that way? Why can't they be saying, `Man,
this is going to be the last time we see Darrell Waltrip at
Daytona? Please just grasp this moment, he's meant so much to this
sport. He's going to be gone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead we're saying, `Look at him. He had to use a
provisional again.' That's the kind of comments he's getting, and
that kind of gets on my nerves. It doesn't seem fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Nighttime is the right time for `Little E'
</P>
<P>
   If it were up to Winston Cup rookie sensation Dale Earnhardt
Jr., there would definitely be more night events on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the our team has done pretty darn well at the night
races this year: we won at Richmond, we won The Winston and then we
finished fourth and led 175 laps at the Coca-Cola 600,'' Dale Jr.
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi 400 will be Chevy No. 8 driver's first experience at
Daytona under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be awesome,'' Dale Jr. said. ``I mean, Daytona is
cool enough just being there anytime, but racing there under the
lights is gonna be great. If I had to say that I had a favorite
track, this place just might be it because of the history of the
track and the high speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Dark horse at Daytona
</P>
<P>
   In the shadows of teammate Dale Jarrett, Ricky Rudd has been
flourishing over the last two months. The Ford No. 28 driver has
finished five of the last seven races in the top 5, including a
third at Pocono two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has a strong chance at winning his first race this year
Saturday night at Daytona. Last February, Rudd won a Gatorade
Twin-125 qualifying race and started second in the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my guys, `don't do anything different than your
doing,'''Rudd said. ``We're doing exactly what we need to do. The
communication keeps getting better and we keep progressing. With
consistent top-five finishes every week, sooner or later you're
going to win something.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush Racing's ``unofficial'' sixth team
</P>
<P>
   The Wood brothers have expanded their working relationship with
Roush Racing, which already has five drivers on the Winston Cup
circuit. The debut of this newly formed alliance takes begins today
at Daytona. Elliott Sadler, driver of the No. 21 Ford, will be
provided with motors, chassis, and bodies from Roush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tapping into stronger and deeper resources,'' said Eddie
Wood, co-owner of the Ford No. 21. ``Jack Roush has welcomed us
with open arms and he's giving us an opportunity to capitalize on
his technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a single car team we've sometimes struggled searching
for the sweet spot on the chassis and body. Now we'll have our
notes and their notes to work from. It will also give Elliott the
opportunity to compare notes with some of the best drivers in the
business. We've been on the top before and we believe this is what
we need to do to rise to the top again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler gives a thumbs-up to the new program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first weekend where we are taking our single car
team and making a six car multi-car team out of it,'' Sadler said.
</P>

   Wallace hog wild over new paint
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace will be debuting a new Miller Lite/Harley Davidson
color scheme on the No. 2 Ford today Daytona. It will also be used
at the two other remaining night races this season, Bristol and
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The Harley Davidson people are all pumped,'' Wallace said.
``It's a sharp looking car with flames all down the sides. Heck,
even my driver's uniform has flames all over it. I try not to be
superstitious about any of this, but it might just be the little
extra shot we need to finally break on through.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was referring to winning a circuit-leading six poles
this year, and failing to transform any of them to a trip to
victory lane.

   NASCAR Q&AMP;A: MIKE BROWN
</P>
<P>
   Mike Brown is a classic example of someone who slowly and
patiently has worked his way to one of the top jobs in NASCAR.
Brown, 41, serves as the general manager for Bill Davis Racing,
which owns the Winston Cup teams of Ward Burton and Dave Blaney.
Here, Brown talks with Cox News Service writer Rick Minter:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was your big break into the business?
</P>
<P>
   A: I got involved with changing tires for some Busch teams, as
sort of a weekend hobby (in 1991). I got invited to Nazareth, Pa.,
to work for an up-and-coming driver, Mike McLaughlin. Mike crashe
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you like so much about changing tires?
</P>
<P>
   A: It allows me to keep my competitive side, which you sometimes
lose when you're dealing with the headaches of the day-to-day
business entities. You know in the back of your mind you're still
going to be part of the show on Sunday. You still get to be part of
that competitive side, that when the team wins a race or finishes
in the top five, you feel like you had something to do with it.''

MAKING WAVES
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a slam-bang movie thrill ride, there's nothing like the
science of fluid dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Really. We're not kidding.
</P>
<P>
   In order to film ``The Perfect Storm,'' Sebastian Junger's
bestselling, nonfiction account of the 1991 mother of all weather
systems and the Massachusetts fishermen who never returned from it,
water the like of which has never before been seen in cinema _
raging chop, withering spray, ocean swell the size of mountains _
had to be created.
</P>
<P>
   And lots of it. Something like half of the film's running time
is set at sea during the storm of the century, when a hurricane, an
arctic front and a third weather system collided in the North
Atlantic. And director Wolfgang Petersen wanted it all to look
convincing and relentlessly terrifying, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great, extreme story of man against nature with
100-foot waves, awesome dimensions,'' explains Petersen, who's made
the above-average action thrillers ``In the Line of Fire'' and
``Air Force One'' and, in his native Germany, ``Das Boot,'' which
is widely considered one of the best submarine movies of all time.
``But, how to put that on the screen? It's fairly easy to write
about it, but how to visualize that in a way a sophisticated
audience of 2,000 would go for the ride and believe it. If it
works, it would be so visceral and in-your-face frightening that it
would almost be hard to sit through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was the goal,'' Petersen adds. ``What we wanted right
from the very beginning was to take an audience to a place where
they have never really been before and experience something that
they've never experienced before. That included myself; I've never
really been in a situation like that, and nobody who has is here
anymore to tell the tale. Thank God, with the filmmaking tools that
we have these days, you can go there. It's far beyond what I could
do in `Das Boot' 19 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for the director to say, since he certainly wasn't going to
take camera boats out in gale conditions to capture the necessary
footage (in fact, Petersen reports that shooting non-storm ocean
scenes off of Dana Point and the lost fishermen's home port of
Gloucester, Mass., was a nightmare of composition-wrecking
crosscurrents and mass seasickness). The really heavy water, over
300 shots' worth, had to be carried digitally.
</P>
<P>
   Which would be a lot of busy work, no doubt, but otherwise
shouldn't be a problem. After all, outfits like Industrial Light &AMP;
Magic had been creating convincing, computer graphic dinosaurs,
meteors, tornadoes and the like for years.
</P>
<P>
   How tough could a little water _ OK, a lot of water _ be?
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the hardest project I've ever done,'' confesses
Stefen Fangmeier, the ILM visual effects supervisor of such CG
benchmarks as ``Twister,'' ``Speed 2'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.''
``You know, you can make one shot beautiful, but the important
thing here was to provide a consistent quality, make all 338 look
great. And there was not only the volume of stuff, but how long it
would take to get it right. The feedback is very slow when you have
to use these very computation-intensive systems. You'd do a
simulation of a wave crest; then it would take two hours before you
could look at it and if it didn't look right, then it takes another
two hours to try to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you had to really nail it pretty close. If any of the
water or boat or wind movement or density was five percent off _ a
little too fast, a little too slow, a little too thick, a little
too clumpy, a little too much reflection _ it looked wrong. There
was little margin for error; either you get it or you just struggle
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's only water. How can water be so complicated? I mean,
everybody knows what water looks like ...
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I see.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are pretty good at looking at water and knowing when
it's wrong,'' ILM's John Anderson notes. ``They're not very good at
telling you what's wrong about it, but they can tell you that it's
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a former University of Wisconsin atmospheric and
oceanic sciences professor, is ILM's resident _ yes _ fluid
dynamics expert. His team was responsible for simulating the
underlying movement of ``Perfect Storm's'' roiling seas to a
persuasive T. But the key word there is ``persuasive''; for all the
hard science and realistic detail which had to inform the watery
computer graphics, an extra, less quantifiable factor had to be
figured in as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, when we've done shows with waves like 'Deep
Impact,' we've hand-animated the bulk of the wave, then
procedurally put texturing and splashes and stuff on top of it,''
Anderson explains. ``For this movie, both because of the number of
shots and because it's a photo-real movie of something that really
happened as opposed to a giant comet or something, we wanted to
have as much of that intrinsic rightness, in terms of how the water
moves, as possible. To the extent that we could, we wanted to start
with something close to physically correct wave fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't mean that we weren't trying to achieve
performances,'' Anderson adds. ``A number of times, we'd go back
and modify a simulation to get a performance, but we tried to keep
the physics during the shot right if we could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Fangmeier puts it, ``We're not making a documentary here.
As long as it looks real and feels right ... and scientific reality
doesn't always feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, what Anderson's team had to perfect on a macro level, the
100-plus digital artists Fangmeier oversaw had to render in
maddeningly precise detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waves, at their surface, have a lot of sudden movement on
them,'' Fangmeier notes. ``It was important to get all of those
right, especially relative to a 70-foot boat, to give it a sense of
scale (a lot of times, the boat would look too modelly or small).
But really, the hardest thing was the white stuff on the water.
That is really the character of the storm, the indicator of how
rough it is. Foam, wave crests, splash ripping off from the waves
is what really gives you the sense that there's this ferocious
storm and great wind going on. Creating all of that stuff on the
water, then adding in boat wakes with their own foam structures,
was quite a technical challenge to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff gets windblown, collides with the boat, splashes off of
it, mixes in with other water movement _ all of these things are
very naturally interrelated, but because of complexity issues with
our computations, we had to deal with them all as separate
elements.'
</P>
<P>
   And that's just inside computers. Though many of the storm shots
featured a CG fishing boat, helicopter, Coast Guard cutter,
sailboat and/or human figures, numerous shots were also composited
with live elements.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and the other actors playing the
doomed crew worked primarily on a lifesize replica of the missing
swordfisher, the Andrea Gail, which was connected to a gimbal in a
95-foot square, 20-foot deep water tank on a Warner Bros.'
soundstage. The blue screen-surrounded facility was also equipped
with wind machines, rain towers and water cannon that spread
buckets of wet stuff all over the frame.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, this chaotic practical water ballet was
relatively easy for the CG artists to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of shots that blend actual guys in the water
with our CG water,'' Fangmeier says. ``But what actually helped in
that process was that the tank water reflected the blue screens,
which made it easier to find the right places to blend our CG water
into that.''
</P>
<P>
   A rare technical nicety in this work-intensive struggle. Of
course, the actors and stuntmen who worked the tank shots had it a
little less cushy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about a film that was a physical challenge of enormous
proportions, it was `Perfect Storm,''' director Petersen marvels.
``I told these guys that it would be really bad if they just came
off as Hollywood actors pretending to be fishermen. We wanted to
create a total reality, which meant that with the dump tanks and
the wind machines and rocking gimbal, they would go through hell.
It was unbelievably tough; the water threw them all over the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they all seemed excited by it,'' Petersen observes.
``That's because, basically, actors like it very much if they get a
chance to prove themselves, that in a physical sense they are up to
the task.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether audiences will be able to take the
just-this-side-of-physical pounding ``The Perfect Storm'' will put
them through remains to be seen. But whether they like it or not,
the breakthrough aspect of this cinematic sea saga cannot be
denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really created water without restraint,'' Fangmeier says
proudly. ``There was nothing Wolfgang asked for that we said we
couldn't do. The boat rolls, the boat flips over, there was nothing
we couldn't have in the movie. When you give a filmmaker an ocean
and can say, 'Do whatever you want,' that's great.'' &QL;

COMPANIES FEUD OVER STORAGE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as it increased the target price for its initial public
offering, StorageNetworks Inc. of Waltham, Mass. has disclosed a
nasty dispute with one of its main hardware suppliers, EMC Corp.
</P>
<P>
   EMC, of Hopkinton, Mass., is the leading producer of disk-drive
assemblies for big computer databases. StorageNetworks buys
equipment from EMC and others, then leases out the capacity to
corporate customers like banks and e-commerce providers.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the two companies have insisted their operations are
complementary, although StorageNetworks has received investments
from such EMC competitors as Compaq Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But strains have emerged as StorageNetworks prepares to go
public, while EMC sorts out its relations with the company and
other startups known as ``storage service providers.''
</P>
<P>
   In filings to securities regulators this week, StorageNetworks
described a letter it received from EMC on June 21. The letter
accused StorageNetworks of pretending EMC has invested in the
company, misappropriating confidential EMC data and hiring away EMC
employees in violation of the contracts, according to the filing.
</P>
<P>
   EMC has threatened to sue, the companies said, though EMC
spokesman Mark Fredrickson wouldn't describe the basis of the
allegations. StorageNetworks executives called the charges false
but wouldn't say more, citing securities rules.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute may cause EMC to terminate contracts,
StorageNetworks said in its filings. Last year, its work as an EMC
subcontractor accounted for about 40 percent of StorageNetworks'
total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Lost revenue could be disruptive to StorageNetworks, which plans
to spend $100 million this year, and $700 million by 2005, building
a fiber-optic network to its storage systems worldwide. Because of
those expenses, the company said that it expects to lose money
``for the foreseeable future.'' The company had an accumulated
deficit of $51.5 million as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that warning, StorageNetworks also increased the price
range for its initial public offering, usually an indication of
strong interest from investors. The new range is $23 to $25 a
share, according to a filing Wednesday, up from the $17 to $19 a
share range the company had previously targeted. StorageNetworks
wouldn't discuss its reasoning for the price increase.
</P>
<P>
   About 9 million shares in the company will be sold, according to
the filing, which would raise more than $200 million at the higher
share price. The company's officers and directors would still
control 68 percent of the company following its IPO,
StorageNetworks said. The IPO is expected in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   StorageNetworks is just one of a host of companies being created
to offer remote-storage services, challenging the business model
for EMC and others who have traditionally sold their gear directly
to users. In May, EMC said it will spend $1 billion over several
years to market and support its products to the new storage-service
providers. EMC has also made minority investments in some of the
companies aiming at consumer markets, including i-drive.com,
X:drive, and SkyDesk.
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, StorageNetworks is well known partly because
its management includes former EMC employees, among them Peter
Bell, the StorageNetworks chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Webster of the Illuminata Group, in Nashua, N.H.,
suggested the close ties may have fanned the competition between
the two companies, however. He noted a StorageNetworks' director
and shareholder, Harry Dixon, was previously a top EMC sales chief
before leaving in January for reasons neither side will discuss.

ONLY CHOICE REMAINING FOR THIS TEAM IS PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was 5:30 p.m. _ dinner time for some families _ and
Rick Pitino's Celtics family was already gathered around a long
table, preparing for what could be their Last (Basketball) Supper.
They were obviously panicking. Some relatives talk about selling
the house; these folks were ready to give the thing away.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Wednesday night, the family decided that it would
be best to trade three No. 1 draft picks along with a player or two
for 21-year-old Portland center Jermaine O'Neal. He is is not
related to the Diesel, Shaquille O'Neal, on the court or off. In
his best season, 1997-98, 6-foot-11-inch Jermaine O'Neal averaged
4.5 points and 3.3 rebounds in 60 games. He is the embodiment of
the ultimate basketball phrase (a player with potential), but the
numbers from last season, 3.9 points and 3.3 rebounds, indicate
that the potential has not been realized.
</P>
<P>
   Please, say a prayer for this troubled family.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said his staff agreed unanimously that O'Neal was the
center who could help the Celtics enter a land (The Playoffs) that
is foreign to them. If you are a Celtics fan, you should hope that
the organization's president and head coach was simply reciting a
sanitized public statement. You should hope that there was someone
at the table who pounded the wood a few times and asked, ``What the
hell are we doing? What are we thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Since rumors are standard on draft night, it made one wonder how
accurate the rumored Organization-for-O'Neal swap was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fairly accurate,'' Pitino replied.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Pitino met with team owner Paul Gaston.
Later, the coach characterized the meeting as ``positive.''
According to Pitino, Gaston told him ``that the future is now'' and
that he wanted Pitino's staff to be ``very aggressive'' in an
attempt to turn the sad Celtics into winners. The Celtics haven't
won as many as 40 games since 1993, which makes them one of three
NBA teams, along with Vancouver and the LA Clippers, in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says the fans have been very patient the past six, seven
years,'' Pitino said of Gaston. ``We are going to be very active,
to try and bring the future a little closer to now. We're being
very active to try to bring our fans a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on their nearly destructive move for O'Neal, The Green
Family took the aggression advice literally. Next, Pitino said, he
will pack his bags and head for the road with general manager Chris
Wallace. They are allowed to speak with free agents beginning
Saturday. They can sign them Aug. 1, although it is not certain
what significant free agent will be willing to join this
dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   As Pitino and Gaston hit the road trying to make the future
better, they will be reminded of their mistakes from the past.
Pitino will remember that he brought in Kenny Anderson to lead his
offense in 1998. By 1999, Anderson and shooting guard Ron Mercer
were at odds.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Anderson and Paul Pierce clashed constantly in
practice and sometimes during games. The men did not have
boys-will-be-boys disputes; there was genuine dislike between them.
One issue was the ball and how Anderson felt Pierce shot it too
much. At times, according to some Celtics, the point guard didn't
want to pass to Pierce for fear that he would heave it even if that
wasn't the wisest thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   So in consecutive seasons, Pitino's point guard _ the one he
brought in because rookie Chauncey Billups couldn't do the job _
didn't click with his shooting guard. There isn't a basketball team
in the NBA that will win with a combination like that.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that love affairs cannot always be explained logically,
Gaston has reportedly told his coach he sees good things in the
near future for this team. Pitino said he believes things are
close, too. He said that a few days after a story linked him with
the coaching vacancy at the University of Miami. He was said to
have lengthy (six hours) and harmless exploratory talks with the
school's athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours of exploration. Who searches that long? Lewis and
Clark?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the Celtics probably won't win next season,
either. They came out of draft night with intriguing big man Jerome
Moiso from UCLA. The 6-11 forward is fluent in French and fluid on
the court, so much of an athlete that ``he runs the floor like Ron
Mercer _ at 6-11,'' Pitino said. He also said Moiso can do things
that no one else on the team can do. That's frightening when you
consider that the draftee was selected 11th, hardly the place where
big men who make an impact are plucked.
</P>
<P>
   Even more chilling is what might happen before the season starts
in November. The most dangerous group or individual is one that
acts out of fear and desperation. The Celtics are that group. There
was talk that forward Antoine Walker might be used as a backup
point guard so mismatches can be created. A better tack, though,
would be to find a point guard who can create mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   When the Celtics begin shopping Saturday, they will be like
ambitious teenagers shopping at the mall. They will see a lot they
like, but won't be able to come up with enough cash to get what
they want. Anderson is a 170-pound weight on their salary cap. They
could trade Walker, although teams usually don't improve when they
trade their best players. They could deal Pierce, just as they
dealt Mercer the season before. That also would not help.
</P>
<P>
   So now they flail about, trying to be aggressive as the owner
requested. It is the kind of aggression that inspires parents to
install safety locks on windows. It's the kind of aggression that
inspires parents to put viewing blocks on televisions. They do it
because they are concerned about what their children will do with
free reign.
</P>
<P>
   As Pitino sat at the long table, a mural of Larry Bird was
draped behind him. The Celtics legend is one person who can change
the direction of this organization. Other than that? Prayer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This history includes attendance at some of our country's most
significant events, including the signing of the Declaration of
Independence. Robert Pines's famous painting shows Continental
Congress delegates signing the Declaration in Philadelphia while
seated in Windsor side chairs.
</P>
<P>
   America's celebration of our centennial brought a renewed
interest in these chairs, and today there are hundreds of Windsor
chairmakers making them with the same careful craftsmanship as the
originals.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy and Wakeman are two of these artisans. Manufacturer's
representatives with flexible schedules by day, the pair run their
small business, Classics in Wood, in their free time. Having bought
the business from Dunphy's brother in 1986, they moved it to
Ashford, Conn., where Dunphy, who had recently moved east from
California, had bought an 18th-century house. They built a barn to
house their new business on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned and passionate woodworkers, the two divided up the
furniture-making process. They hired Jim McMullan full time and
Erik Wohl part time to put the chairs together. Their duties
include cutting out the pine chair seats after tracing the
dimensions from metal and cardboard templates; hollowing and
smoothing the seat by hand and tapering the maple spindles and
stretchers to fit the appropriate grooves in the seat, bent oak
arms, and back. All dovetailing and joinery are done by hand _ no
machines, no nails, only glue.
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy does all the handwork, such as the delicate carving on
the ends of chair arms. He's also in charge of finishes _ the
paints and antiquing. (He will stain a chair only if the buyer is
insistent.) And he works with customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeman makes all the tables and large case pieces such as
huntboards, apothecary desks, and shoefoot hutch tables and
dressers. He does all the custom work. All his tabletops are made
from wood salvaged from 18th- and 19th-century structures such as
wainscotting and flooring. Such wood, says Dunphy, is becoming
increasingly difficult to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have copied the chairs of E. B. Tracy, who is considered
the patriarch of the Windsor chair,'' says Dunphy. ``He lived in
Norwich (Conn.) and was a high-volume producer of chairs. His
inventory has been published so we were able to study his chairs,
plus there's been a lot written about him and his work. To copy a
chair in a museum, for example, we measure all the angles _ top,
front, and back. The chair is such a complex structure, the way
it's formed and turned _ the spindles, stretchers, and legs. It's
very complicated to make everything fit.''
</P>
<P>
   But when everything fits, there's a visual harmony unsurpassed
by any other chair made for the masses.

   Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Frye's
Measure Mill of Wilton, N.H., is one of the few remaining
water-powered mills in the nation and the only measure mill still
active today. It's nestled at the end of a winding country road in
a breathtaking landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Round wooden measures were used by farmers and fishermen as
standard units before mechanical scales became the norm. They came
in five sizes _ one, two, and four quarts, a single peck, and a
half bushel. Measures were first made on this site in 1876,
followed by piggins or dippers, which were round wooden measures
with a wood handle attached.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, Dr. Edmund Bailey Frye of Roxbury, Mass., bought the
mill for his son, Whitney, who added new products such as curry
cards (combs for cattle), wool cards, and pantry boxes to the
mill's product line and continually updated the machinery. After
World War II, Harland Savage, a local boy, began working at the
mill and eventually became its owner. The highlight of his tenure
came with a visit from Shaker eldress Bertha Lindsey in the late
1960s. The last Shaker box maker had died in 1961, and Lindsey
asked Harland if he would be interested in carrying on the sect's
box making at Frye's. His answer, of course, was an unqualified
yes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the mill was bought by Harland's son, Harley, and his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of taking over the business,'' says Harley,
who had worked at the mill during his teenage years. ``I was an
oceanography major at UNH until I found out that I wouldn't be able
to dive for medical reasons. So I switched to woodworking.''
</P>
<P>
   And that led him and his artist wife to the proprietorship of
Frye's.
</P>
<P>
   Their goals, says Harley, were to make high-quality boxes that
would attract the museum-shop market, expand their product line and
retail store, and restore the mill and grounds to their original
beauty. They also moved on site into a house attached to the mill
with a view of the pond and the waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   The mill was included in ``America Restored,'' a book published
by the National Trust for Historical Preservation that took two
sites from every state as representative of private individuals'
maintaining and protecting historic landmarks. The Savages also
broadened their product line to include swing, spool, spice,
Colonial, wedding, courting, and tinder boxes _ all made by hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best sellers are our carriers and especially our salt and
pepper carrier, mantel boxes, game boxes, and our tavern house
line,'' says Pam, who hand-paints several lines of boxes and does
all the buying for the seven-room store. The store not only
features Frye boxes but crafts by other artisans such as pottery,
period lighting, pewter, and hand-forged ironware and tinware.
``Our customers expect us to have new items every year. Coming up
with new pieces every year is one of our greatest challenges.''

CONCEIVING SOME HIP, NEW DESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who can blame women for not wanting to spend money on maternity
clothes? The garments, after all, are temporary; the designs often
atrocious; and no designer seems willing to sacrifice his or her
chic image by dressing the pregnant. No wonder tunics and leggings
triumph in the third trimester.
</P>
<P>
   But that has begun to change.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, A Pea in the Pod president Rebecca Matthias
approached Lilly Pulitzer, a fellow Philadelphia company, to spin
out maternity wear for the 40-store chain's winter resort
collection. And a trend was born.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Matthias persuaded Vivienne Tam, Nicole Miller, and
Trina Turk to conceive lines for mothers-in-waiting. Turk and
Miller's small collections hit the stores in April and are
expanding for debut fall collections. Tam's clothing, which
Matthias calls a ``forward, body-conscious'' (read: clingy) look,
is also expanding into a fall line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes against the trend of what you think women want,''
she said of Tam's tight-fitting fashions. ``But they're keying off
celebrities who are showing off their bodies because they're in
such good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Come August, maternity wear by designer BCBG will be in the
stores, which are also stocking Bisou Bisou and Levi's jeans (the
zipper is replaced with a cotton stretch pouch). Then there's Three
Dot T-shirts, which are otherwise only available at Bergdorf
Goodman and Barney's.
</P>
<P>
   None of this comes cheaply, of course.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chestnut Hill, Boston, store, a chartreuse and gold weave
long stretch sheath with bolero jacket by Bisou Bisou cost $290. A
Trina Turk light cotton brown and blue swirl spread-collar blouse
is priced at $70, with $195 matching pants. A Lilly green and
yellow print number was $170. And one pair of Levi's, trimmed at
the hem in pink, burgundy, and red suede stripes, was priced at
$180.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is sensitivity to price in maternity clothes for the
reason you stated: short life,'' Matthias said. ``But women always
want to look good.'' And ``it's nice to see a familiar brand that
you've worn before'' in a maternity store.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Miller has found that to be true. When she was pregnant
five years ago, she realized there was a void in the market for
would-be moms who wanted to be stylish.
</P>
<P>
   She introduced a few pieces of a maternity line, which turned
out to be a short-lived venture. Because the market is relatively
small (with 4 million births a year), her time was better spent on
the overall collection.
</P>
<P>
   But A Pea in the Pod has its own distribution system and
provides maternity patterns for the designers, making Matthias's
pitch harder for Miller and others to turn down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we've tested out they've done well with,'' Miller
said. ``Everybody has been disgusted for years about maternity wear
. . . the same way they were disgusted with bridesmaid dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of designer wear in A Pea in the Pod appears to
be paying off. Matthias said that same-store sales have increased
40 percent over last year. Specific sales figures are not available
for the chain, which is owned by Mothers Work Inc., also the parent
company for Mimi Maternity (Bloomingdale's-level contemporary
garments) and Motherhood Maternity (the Old Navy of pregnancy
clothing). But overall sales for the three stores have hit about
$400 million, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While some pregnant women are flaunting their bodies, many
others want to hide theirs, especially when it comes to bathing
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Two Boston-based women, Faviana Olivier and Diane Wood, have
launched FlirtSkirt, a company that designs flouncy,
just-above-the-knee bathing suit wraps.
</P>
<P>
   The skirts are produced by a women-owned manufacturer in Western
Massachusetts that hires immigrants and single mothers to teach
them a trade and/or English. Some of the proceeds from the wraps _
which come in black, royal blue, or leopard print _ will go toward
scholarships for those workers. They're available only through the
Web (www.flirtskirt.com) or by calling 1-800-560-3849.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And while you're melting at the beach, imagine what's happening
to your makeup, especially if you brought it along or left it in
the car.
</P>
<P>
   At temperatures as low as 80 degrees, a compact of creme blusher
or a tube of lipstick can liquify, and worse, ooze.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new thermal insulated makeup bag on the market that
can withstand temperatures up to 140 degrees for at least two hours
without the contents melting.
</P>
<P>
   The Macqui bag (pronounced ma-KEE) is available at some spas and
specialty stores or through 1-877-8MACQUI. Prices range from $24.95
for an average-sized black model to $45.95 for a large box-case
with mirror.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Anita Brown is having one of her moments. The
founder of a nonprofit group called Black Geeks Online is at
Harvard to participate in a panel discussion about the digital
divide, and there are a few things she would like to discuss. What
is wrong, she wants to know, with all those caffeinated kids who
work 24 hours a day without stopping to call their mamas or take a
look at the world? What good, she asks, is a computer if you're
poor and hungry and can't get a job?
</P>
<P>
   And another thing. What is all this gee-whiz technology doing to
the thing called humanity? ``They call this online connectivity or
community, but it's not,'' she says. ``Community is when you have a
crisis at home: Who do you call to take care of your babies while
you run down to the hospital at 3 o'clock in the morning? That's
community.''
</P>
<P>
   She interrupts her stream-of-consciousness monologue to seek a
light for a cigarette, and within minutes, she's deep in a
discussion with a woman who represents a health-oriented Web site.
The next thing you know, Brown has the woman's business card. The
contact may come in handy some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an Aquarius,'' she says. ``Humanity is my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is one of those individuals that author Malcolm Gladwell
describes as a ``connector,'' a walking, talking Rolodex of sorts
who makes it her business to bring other people together. And for
the past five years, she's been doing her matchmaking on the
Internet. Using the online monikers of Sistah Geek and Miss D.C.,
Brown runs Black Geeks Online from her home in Washington. Founded
on a whim in 1996, the loose-knit organization has grown from 18
members to 25,000  &UR; today &LR; , and Brown has established herself as an
unofficial Internet griot who sends out missives to members all
over the world, from the South Bronx to South Africa. The
organization is a sort of digital grapevine for people of color
online, and Brown has made it her mission to encourage black
information technology professionals to volunteer in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a genius for knowing all the right people,'' says Adam
Fisher, senior associate editor of Wired magazine. ``She makes
things happen.'' Brown has adopted Fisher as her ``new best
friend;'' she feeds him tips about black high-tech entrepreneurs
who should be featured in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old grandmother, however, is the first to admit that
she is an unlikely role model for budding geeks. A sixth-generation
Washingtonian, she dropped out of college after six months _ ``I
didn't like it. They told you to read the book and spit it out'' _
and spent several decades working as a secretary in the civil
service. Back in her day, the transistor radio was considered
high-tech. But her brother, a retired computer engineer, introduced
her to the Internet in 1994. She resisted at first _ ``I said, `Oh
no you don't. Big Brother will not get me!' '' _ but when she
discovered that she could exchange recipes with a chef in New
Orleans, she was hooked. ``I'm a communicator, an information
broker, and I saw the potential,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Since she founded Black Geeks in her living room four years ago,
she has organized an information technology workshop called
``Taking IT to the Streets,'' which introduced 200 newbies to
computers and the Internet. Earlier this year, she was tapped as
one of the Top 25 Women on the Web by SFWoW, a San Francisco-based
association of professional women involved in the Internet. Brown,
who is known for wearing red high tops and a Tweety Bird watch,
shared the honors with top CEOs and computer scientists. ``She
isn't your typical CEO, but she has made a difference by helping
other women get over their fear of the Internet,'' says Mary Choy,
who ran the committee that selected this year's winners. ``When she
accepted her award, she said, `They told me not to wear sneakers
and not to curse onstage, but here I am, wearing sneakers and
cursing onstage.' She fit in beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown chooses not to wear those red high tops for her appearance
at Harvard, though. ``A girl has to look her best,'' she says with
a coy smile. But she is going to speak her mind. She is frequently
asked to speak about the digital divide, the gap between the
technology haves and have-nots. The digital divide is usually
described as a gap between blacks and whites, but Brown isn't
convinced that the problem can easily be solved by throwing money
and computers at poor communities. ``My main concern, from (Vice
President Al) Gore to (Microsoft chairman Bill) Gates, is that all
this equipment and money is being handed out in a vacuum,'' she
says. ``They're putting computers in the schools without talking to
the parents or the community. None of this money is going to train
people. They're just creating new consumers, and the last thing
poor people need to do is to find a new electronic mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, like many other former Internet enthusiasts, no longer
thinks that computers in and of themselves can provide the answer
to society's ills. ``I'm a techno realist,'' she says. ``It's time
to stop and say, `Wait a minute.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And she is willing to stir up debate wherever she goes. At the
Harvard conference, which was called Internet and Society 2000, she
objects when a moderator wants to discuss the digital divide in the
Third World. ``I don't see how we can fix someone else's barn when
ours is falling to the ground,'' she says. When she goes through
her spiel about the Internet dehumanizing society, including the
bit about the coffee, the crowd applauds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anita is a '60s revolutionary who uses the Internet as a new
tool to kind of continue the philosophy and ideology of changing
things and not accepting the status quo,'' says Kenny Granderson, a
fellow panelist and the founder of Inner City Software in
Dorchester. Granderson is a kindred spirit. He founded Boston
Blacks Online, a group of 650 members who communicate on the
Internet. ``We both deal with people on a grassroots level, dealing
with the regular Joes and Janes,'' Granderson says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a few days in Cambridge, Brown connects with many
Joes and Janes and counts a number of ``new best friends.'' After
her appearance on the panel, she launches an animated conversation
with Jose Orlando Lopez, vice-president for academic affairs and
innovations at the American University of Puerto Rico. She takes
his card, one more for her Rolodex. You never know when Sistah Geek
might need a best friend in Puerto Rico.

</P>
<P>
   Has any president been written off as a lame duck more often
than Bill Clinton? They first pinned him with the label after the
1994 congressional elections; then after his re-election; then
after his impeachment; then last fall after the Senate killed the
nuclear test-ban treaty; and last week, once more, now that fund
raising has come to dominate his public profile.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is a lame duck?
</P>
<P>
   The term originated, like its fellow faunal terms bull and bear,
on the London stock exchange of the 18th century. A lame duck
referred to a broker who defaulted on his debts.
</P>
<P>
   Americans adapted the term to politics, liberally applying it to
any president whose powers are thought to be waning, such as
President Lyndon Johnson after he announced in 1968 that he
wouldn't seek re-election or Harry Truman after the Democrats lost
control of Congress in 1946. Some politicians and newspapers even
called on Truman to resign.
</P>
<P>
   One passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951 extended a certain
lame-duckery to all second-term presidents because it bars them
from running for a third term. At the precise moments of their
re-elections, both Ronald Reagan and Clinton were billed lame ducks
by newscasters.
</P>
<P>
   Properly speaking, though, lame ducks are those presidents
occupying the White House in the weeks between the election and the
inauguration of their successors. The original lame-duck interval
stretched from Election Day in November to March 4, Inauguration
Day.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1933, acknowledging that planes, trains, and cars made it
easier to set up a new administration quickly, the states ratified
the 20th Amendment (the ``Lame-Duck Amendment''), which advanced
Inauguration Day to Jan. 20 and the start of the new Congress to
Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lame duck'' is typically slung as a pejorative, depicting the
outgoing president as someone who has little hope of disciplining
his party, influencing legislation, or seeing his appointments
confirmed. Certainly, some presidents have gone comatose in the
interval between the successor's election and inauguration,
occasionally with baleful consequences. But it's often forgotten
that some presidents have used the time to act boldly and to leave
a mark on history.
</P>
<P>
   The most audacious of the lame ducks was John Adams, the second
president, who made the so-called ``midnight'' judicial
appointments in 1801. A member of the Federalist Party, Adams lost
his re-election bid in 1800 to Thomas Jefferson of the
Democratic-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But in February 1801, with weeks to go before Jefferson and a
Republican Congress took power, the Federalists passed the
Judiciary Act of 1801. This law created six federal circuit courts
and 16 new judgeships to run those courts. It assigned them
jurisdiction over a whole new array of lawsuits, greatly
strengthening the federal government at the expense of state power
_ the key point of contention between Adams' Federalists and
Jefferson's states'-rights-oriented Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Wasting no time, the lame-duck Adams proceeded to staff the new
judgeships (and other judgeships) with Federalists. Republicans
howled.
</P>
<P>
   On taking office, Jefferson had James Madison, his secretary of
state, refuse to seat one of the appointments, Justice of the Peace
William Marbury. Marbury sued and ultimately lost _ under a Supreme
Court headed, ironically, by Chief Justice John Marshall, another
of Adams' lame-duck appointees. Yet the Federalists had the last
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   More important than Madison's victory was the precedent that
Marbury vs. Madison established: That it is the Supreme Court's
prerogative to decide whether a law is constitutional. This
power-grab by the high court marked a great and lasting victory for
the federal government over the states.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Democrat James Buchanan in 1860-61 proved a model
of the classically feckless lame duck. A mediocre president who
routinely ranks near the bottom in historians' surveys, Buchanan
struggled haplessly in trying to keep the South from seceding
throughout his term. By the 1860 election, his party had split into
Northern and Southern factions, allowing the upstart Republican
Party, with Abraham Lincoln as its nominee, to sweep the Northern
states and win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that the North now held a majority of electoral votes
and fearing that Lincoln and the Republicans would act to abolish
or imperil slavery, Southern states took steps toward secession. On
Dec. 20, 1860, South Carolina first took the plunge. On Feb. 7,
delegates from seven states met to form the Confederate States of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was too weak both personally and politically to stop
them. He thundered about the illegality of secession but refused to
back up his words with force. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile,
in consultation with Lincoln, thwarted Buchanan's slapdash efforts
to negotiate the South back into the Union. Civil War became
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, weakness more than boldness has been the norm for
outgoing presidents. LBJ got nowhere in his last-ditch effort to
bring peace to Vietnam, partly because Richard Nixon's team,
through back channels, was secretly discouraging the South
Vietnamese from accepting Johnson's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, when a departing Gerald Ford came out for developing
the B-1 bomber and for making Puerto Rico a state, editorialists
blasted him (in Time's words) as one ``whose desire to deepen his
mark in history is matched only by his loss of real power.''
</P>
<P>
   But occasionally in recent times lame ducks have acted
forcefully anyway. In December 1980, as they prepared to turn over
the presidency and the Senate to the Republicans, the Democrats
staved off a Republican filibuster and managed to pass the
``Superfund'' environmental law, allowing for the cleanup of toxic
waste. President Jimmy Carter signed the bill on Dec. 11, and on
his last day in office issued an executive order putting the
legislation into effect, lest Reagan's administration decide to let
the fund languish.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, business lobbies use the fact that Superfund was
passed during a lame-duck period as an argument for its abolition.
Less admirably, a lame-duck George Bush pardoned a slew of his
friends who faced indictment in the Iran-Contra scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, too, lame-duck presidencies create not one-sided
partisan triumphs but successful compromises. A political scientist
named John Massaro has argued that on the whole lame-duck
presidents appoint the best Supreme Court justices (although he
defines the lame-duck period as the presidents' final year in
office).
</P>
<P>
   Because these presidents know that failure to confirm their
nominees will mean allowing their successors to fill the vacancy,
he suggests, they have tended to choose nominees who are both
centrist in their ideology and of manifestly high caliber. John
Marshall, Louis Brandeis and William Brennan are among those
high-court legends appointed toward the end of a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be that lame-duckery is just a state of mind. When
lame ducks have succumbed to their status, as Buchanan did, history
has judged them as weak or disastrous. But when they have refused
to let their wings be clipped _ as with Adams and the federal
judiciary, and Carter with the Superfund _ the gamble can result if
not in a boost to their reputations then at least in victories for
the causes they value.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, as he packs his bags for Chappaqua, N.Y., may not
be able to alter his legacy for history. But he might still be able
to do a hell of a lot of good.

BILL RICHARDSON'S BAD CAREER MOVE

</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy, the Bermuda Triangle of Cabinet
agencies, could soon claim another victim. The Case of the Missing
Hard Disks has doomed Secretary Bill Richardson's aspiration to be
Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators are demanding Richardson's resignation.
George W. Bush is turning the nuclear bumbling into a campaign
issue. The Senate Armed Services Committee summoned Richardson for
a spanking. Democratic senators ripped him. Republicans suggested
that an independent agency, not DOE, should supervise nuclear
weapons and security. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., vowed that the
Senate would never support Richardson again.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., growled, ``You have lost what
credibility you had left on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   During his days as an international troubleshooter, Richardson
liked being called ``007,'' but not even James Bond could escape
from the torture chamber Richardson is in now.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's response to the Los Alamos fiasco has been
energetic shirking. He brags shrilly about other nuclear-security
improvements: ``In two years I have done more on security than has
been done in the past 20 years.'' He whines that he doesn't deserve
blame, and he passes the buck onto careless Los Alamos scientists
and their anti-security culture.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the best-natured of pols, Richardson is displaying an
uncharacteristic lack of grace. It's easy to understand why. He is
surely regretting one of the worst career moves in recent
Washington history: his 1998 promotion from U.N. ambassador to
energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Running DOE is like herding rattlesnakes. Each of its
responsibilities is worse than the next: holding down gas prices,
bullying OPEC, building nuclear weapons, protecting secrets about
those weapons, disposing of waste from those weapons, apologizing
to all the employees made sick by those weapons, etc. The job
requires vast technical knowledge, an ability to navigate a
labyrinthine bureaucracy, high tolerance for the whimsical behavior
of scientists, and a heavy interest in hands-on management.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not much concern Richardson's supreme talent:
personal politics. In the United States today, only Bill Clinton is
a better natural politician. As a congressional candidate,
Richardson set the Guinness World Record for most handshakes in a
day _ nearly 8,500. He held more than 2,000 town meetings during
his 14-year congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   Retail politics and human contact thrill him: ``He just comes at
you and wears you down with charm and with humor,'' says David
Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy. Nemtzow
describes hosting a fund-raiser for 400 people. Richardson arrived
just off a plane from Turkey, sleep-deprived, and promised, ``I'm
not going home until I meet everyone in this room.'' He made good
on his promise.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary credits his ease to a bicultural
upbringing. Born in California in 1947, he grew up in Mexico City
with a Mexican socialite mother and American banker father. He
prepped at a tony school in Massachusetts, and he always moved
easily between the Anglo and Latino worlds. Though he had no
connection to New Mexico, Richardson carpetbagged there because of
its Anglo-Latin ethnic stew.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was elected to the U.S. House from the most diverse
district in the nation: 44 percent Anglo, 34 percent Hispanic, and
20 percent Indian. He jokes that he was the perfect candidate
because: ``I have an Anglo surname, I speak Spanish, and I look
Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson thrived on Capitol Hill. He became House Democrats'
chief deputy whip, a job that suited his love of glad-handing and
strong-arming. Clinton passed over Richardson for the Cabinet in
1992, but the president and the congressman, each recognizing a
kindred spirit, became fast friends. Soon Clinton deputized
Richardson to act as an unofficial U.S. negotiator with thugs and
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'90s, Richardson freed a U.S. helicopter pilot downed
over North Korea, a pair of Americans who inadvertently crossed
into Iraq, an American jailed in Bangladesh, and three aid workers
held hostage in Sudan, among others. He was dispatched to butter up
Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, Haiti's military dictators, and
Burma's tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson courted the despots with the same rumpled,
hail-fellow-well-met manner that won him friends at home. He played
up his friendship with the president, flattered the
hostage-holders, listened to them graciously, ate their food, told
self-deprecating jokes, and cajoled them with promises of good
press and American sympathy. He was magic.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese rebel Kerubino Kwanyin Bol was intransigent till
Richardson asked to visit Kerubino's child, who was dying of
measles. That request melted the warlord, who dropped his ransom
demand from $2.5 million to a few jeeps and some rice. Richardson's
missions won him three Nobel Peace Prize nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Richardson brought his retail style to the United
Nations. He worked the cafeteria, shaking every hand he could find.
He admiringly called Kofi Annan ``a political animal'' and pegged
Laurent Kabila, with whom he negotiated Congo's peace agreement, as
``a street-smart Chicago ward heeler.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's career, in short, testifies to the power of the
schmooze. Unlike Clinton, he doesn't marry schmoozing to wonkery.
He is weak on policy, often skipping complicated discussions for a
cigar and a party. He has no great beliefs, which may be why he
didn't mind flattering despots. In Richardson's world, personal
relationships may trump principles, and friendships may supersede
treaties. Clinton exploited this during his Monica Lewinsky
troubles. Click here to see how.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had excellent careerist reasons to take the Energy
job: DOE has a huge presence in New Mexico. Energy secretary,
unlike U.N. ambassador, is a real Cabinet post with real authority.
And it positioned him perfectly for veep: a personable Hispanic
with legislative, international, and executive experience.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Richardson eluded the Energy Curse that had
tarnished the careers of Hazel O'Leary, Federico Pena, and almost
everyone else who'd been secretary. Arriving in the midst of the
Wen Ho Lee scandal, he calmed Congress by tightening security. He
launched a pilot project to dispose of nuclear weapon waste,
something his predecessors could never manage.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, his in-your-face diplomacy persuaded OPEC to boost
oil production, which halted hikes in U.S. gas prices (though
Richardson does not seem to have any short-term fix for the current
gas price spike).
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Alamos farce is showing why political savvy alone is
limited as a governing strategy. Richardson's charm does not reach
the folks deep in the bowels of Energy. DOE's nuclear scientists,
who are more interested in the free flow of information than in new
regs, have been indifferent to his action plans and security
upgrades. A secretary with intense knowledge of the labs and a deep
interest in security policy _ a wonk or maybe a bully _ might have
dug and bitched and harassed his employees till he knew the labs
were clean. But that's not Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   According to Richardson's testimony last Wednesday, June 21, the
FBI has turned up no evidence of espionage involving the hard
drives. That is good news for the United States, but perhaps bad
news for Richardson, since the alternative to espionage is
something much more humiliating: incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The huge lag between the drives' disappearance and Richardson's
hearing about it, the shoddy record-keeping in the security vault,
the rediscovery of the drives behind a copying machine,
Richardson's persistent ignorance about what was going on at Los
Alamos _ all this make the secretary look like a sap.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson happily played the shambling, self-deprecating genial
fellow when he was lobbying for the release of hostages. But he is
discovering, painfully, that there is a difference between playing
the fool and being the fool.

</P>
<P>
   Between the time a presidential candidate clinches his party's
nomination and the moment he stands before the convention to kick
off the general election campaign, he must make a daunting
decision: choose someone to serve as his running mate and, in case
of victory, his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   During this interval, the presidential candidates contemplate
and the political strategists and pundits argue the advantages and
disadvantages of the prospects _ weighing elements of geography,
ideology, personal history, ethnicity, religion, campaign skills,
and personal compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the most fascinating and suspenseful questions of
the entire campaign _ and, from a political standpoint, one of the
least important.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because for all the ink and air time devoted to the
selection, it's not likely to have any detectable bearing on the
outcome of the race _not this year, and not any year. Given that
the vice president can become president at any moment _ as 13 vice
presidents have done _ you would think Americans would place
considerable importance on his or her fitness for the top job. An
ill-considered No. 2 could become a disastrous chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that for better or worse, voters don't make
their decision on that criterion, and they never have. For most
Americans, casting a ballot on the basis of the vice-presidential
nominee is like choosing a spouse based on the attractiveness of
the in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   It's widely assumed that a poor choice can torpedo a campaign.
When George Bush picked Dan Quayle in August 1988, Bush trailed
Michael Dukakis in the polls by anywhere from seven to 14 points.
Quayle was a disaster from the start when he was swept into a
controversy over his Vietnam-era service in the Indiana National
Guard, a furor that immediately revealed him to be a vacant boob
for whom the term ``deer in the headlights'' was coined. Things
only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   In his debate with Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle
dared to claim that he was just as experienced as John Kennedy was
when he ran for president. Bentsen shot back one of the most
devastating rejoinders in campaign history: ``I knew Jack Kennedy.
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, a Senate veteran, was experienced and articulate, with
a distinguished record in World War II. Next to him, Quayle was
hopelessly outdone by any measure _ except one. Bush and Quayle won
54 percent of the popular vote and 426 of the 538 electoral votes.
Bentsen couldn't even carry his home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was the worst GOP running mate since Richard Nixon chose
Spiro Agnew, who also made the leap from complete unknown to
national laughingstock practically overnight. His 1968 campaign
performance was a catalog of gaffes, from calling a reporter a
``fat Jap'' to saying, ``If you've seen one city slum, you've seen
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats exploited the opening for all it was worth,
running one brutally effective ad with Agnew's visage accompanied
by the sound of a man laughing uproariously. Meanwhile, Edmund
Muskie quickly proved so impressive as Hubert Humphrey's sidekick
that he was soon hailed as a future president. The
vice-presidential competition was a slam-dunk triumph for the
Democrats. The election, however, was not.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other history confirms the essential irrelevance of
running mates. Franklin Roosevelt won with three different ones.
Tom Dewey lost in 1944 and 1948 with two different ones, as did
Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   George McGovern didn't help his cause when he had to drop Tom
Eagleton from the 1972 Democratic ticket after it was learned he
had been treated for depression, but McGovern couldn't have won
with Thomas Jefferson on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bob Dole caught hell in 1976 for denouncing ``Democrat
wars,'' factors such as the pardon of Richard Nixon, the defeat in
Vietnam, and the bumpy economy were what really cost Gerald Ford
the election. In 1996, sunny and loquacious Jack Kemp was
everyone's idea of the perfect running mate for the laconic,
prickly Bob Dole, but Kemp had no discernible impact.
</P>
<P>
   In Gallup Polls taken every four years asking if the selection
of a particular running mate or a type of running mate (a black,
for example, or a woman) would make the respondent more or less
likely to vote for either ticket, the invariable consensus choice
is that it ``doesn't make much difference.'' Even in 1988, 64
percent of voters said that about Quayle. Only 5 percent of those
who voted for Dukakis gave Quayle as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barone, co-editor of The Almanac of American Politics,
says the closest a running mate has come to deciding an election
was 1960, when Lyndon Johnson helped secure Texas by a bare 46,000
votes in an extremely close election. But even if the Democrats had
lost there, John Kennedy still would have won with nine electoral
votes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   From the early days of the republic, presidential nominees have
generally tried to balance the ticket by choosing someone different
from themselves in regional origin, philosophy, religion, and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the usual imperatives in 1992, Bill Clinton chose a
fellow moderate, Southern, Protestant baby boomer. Though Gore
probably deserves credit for bringing Tennessee into the Democratic
column, that made no difference in the outcome, and even two guys
from Dixie could carry only five of 12 Southern states in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any of the prospects being mentioned to make a
difference this year. Gray Davis or Dianne Feinstein might nail
down California _ running mates do tend to help in their home
states _ but Gore shouldn't need special help to win there.
</P>
<P>
   As for energizing women, neither Feinstein nor any other female
is likely to do that, any more than the only previous female
choice, Geraldine Ferraro, did in 1984: She and Walter Mondale got
the same percentage of the women's vote (45) that Carter and
Mondale had gotten four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was talked about as a way to
capture Hispanics _ at least until news emerged of nuclear weapons
security lapses on his watch _ but even a flawless Hispanic
probably wouldn't have the slightest effect on the outcome. Bush
will win Texas regardless, and Florida should be his unless his
campaign implodes. In Illinois, one of the few really competitive
states with many Hispanics, they have a powerful habit of voting
Democratic already.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinoisans available, such as Sen. Dick Durbin or Gore
campaign manager Bill Daley, have local name recognition lower than
that of the Cubs' backup catcher. Gov. Tom Ridge would help more in
Pennsylvania, but he runs the risk of driving anti-abortion
Republicans into the arms of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is supposed to be able to deliver hordes of
reform-minded independents to Bush, but there is no reason to think
his appeal is transferable. Whatever McCain does, they're likely to
split between Bush, Gore, Buchanan, and even Ralph Nader (why do
you think they're called independents?).
</P>
<P>
   Though imaginative observers can spin out all sorts of elaborate
theories how this or that running mate could be the key to the Oval
Office, the Election Day reality never seems to live up to the
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe this year is different. This year, you see, there's
the tantalizing Colin Powell scenario. It goes like this: Bush
makes him the first black to run on a major party's national
ticket, millions of black voters are so enthralled by the chance to
put one of their own in the nation's second-highest office that
they abandon their traditional party allegiance, turning the tide
in one crucial state after another and delivering Bush a stunning
victory. Could it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Naahh.

HARVARD PROFESSOR POOH-POOHS MCGWIRE'S RECORDS. IS HE RIGHT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this season, players have continued
to jack long balls out of Houston's home-run-friendly Enron Field
at a record pace, provoking yet another chapter in the ongoing saga
of complaint about the newly ``insane'' offensive numbers put up in
the ``watered down'' world of Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint is entirely fair: Home runs can't be as meaningful
as they once were if Steve Finley is on pace to hit more in a
season than Reggie Jackson ever did.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also irrelevant. Baseball history, even as the purists
who complain about today's cheapened offensive statistics construct
it, is little more than a record of inflated achievement. Insane
numbers don't threaten the integrity of baseball's historical
accomplishments. They constitute it.
</P>
<P>
   A textbook example of the complaint appears in Paul C. Weiler's
recent book ``Leveling the Playing Field.'' After noting that ``the
biggest reason for the resurgence of interest in baseball in the
late 1990s was the phenomenal number of home runs being hit,''
Weiler reminds us that the number wasn't so ``phenomenal'' as it
seemed to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows,'' he explains, ``how close Sosa came to
McGwire in 1998 (with 66 homers) and how close both came again in
1999 (with 65 and 63, respectively). What few fans realize, though,
is that neither McGwire nor Sosa came close to breaking Babe Ruth's
true home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose we were to do the same kind of adjustment for home run
inflation that we regularly do for economic inflation, for example,
to calculate the real rise of the Dow Jones Index from the 1920s to
the 1990s. In order for a McGwire or a Sosa (or Ken Griffey Jr.) to
break Ruth's real home run record from the 1920s, he now has to hit
more than 150, not just 60, home runs over the season.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a remarkable mixture of elitism and populism in this
sequence _ elitism in Weiler's commitment to chastising the fans
producing baseball's ``recent resurgence'' for misunderstanding the
meaning of the ``phenomenal number of home runs'' they enjoy;
populism in using the same argument to celebrate the ``real'' and
``true'' achievements of an icon from a previous period of
``resurgence of interest in baseball'': ``It should now be clear
why Babe Ruth was our greatest athlete in any sport in the past
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the elitism and the populism in this claim are less far
apart than they might seem. Harvard professor Weiler doesn't hold
his own judgments to the same standard he imposes on the masses.
He's a fan of Ruth in exactly the same way that they are fans of
Sosa and McGwire. For Ruth's true home run record, at least
according to the ``economic inflation'' model Weiler provides,
wasn't 60 but 54.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Ruth hit 54 of the 369 home runs in the American
League, roughly 15 percent. When he hit 60 in 1927, the league hit
439; his portion had dropped to roughly 14 percent. Indeed,
measured in terms of his distance from the competition, Ruth's real
record was 29, the number he hit in 1919 when his closest
competitor managed only 10 (his closest competitors hit 19 in 1920
and 47 in 1927). However you slice it, Ruth's 60 is no more real a
home run mark than McGwire's 70.
</P>
<P>
   By the standard Weiler invokes, almost none of baseball's
landmark achievements are real. Statistics shape our understanding
of baseball history more than they shape our understanding of the
histories of other sports, but the statistics on which baseball
historians generally rely look more like iconic numbers than like
meaningful data.
</P>
<P>
   Take what is almost always adduced as the greatest single year
any pitcher has had in the modern era: Bob Gibson's 1968 season
with a record of 22-9 (including 13 shutouts in 34 starts) and an
ERA of 1.12. It's the 1.12 ERA that gets people's attention, and
rightly so; only one other pitcher in the postwar era, and I mean
post-WWI era, has even broken 1.50 _ Walter Johnson with a 1.49 in
1919. But Gibson's performance came during a period of pitching
inflation even greater than today's hitting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the overall National League ERA was only 2.99. In terms
of the averages established by his peers, Gibson had a great year,
one of the six greatest ever. In the 1990s, Greg Maddux had two
consecutive years in which he outperformed the National League by
an even greater margin. He just didn't have a 1.12 ERA. That
pitching numbers were ``watered down'' in 1968 doesn't compromise
the legacy of Gibson's achievement. It instead made his achievement
and its legacy possible.
</P>
<P>
   And so when you hear that today's players are overrated, just
remind yourself that being overrated is the best way to be highly
rated in baseball history. Over time we forget about the
circumstances that account for the statistical extremes we
celebrate. We hear about the insane offensive performances of this
season, but what about the insane offensive performances that this
era's stars are trying to eclipse? Hack Wilson's single-season
record of 190 RBIs is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930 the National League enjoyed one of the greatest
offensive years in baseball history: The average batting average
for non-pitchers was .312. The year saw three of the 10 highest RBI
totals in baseball history, four of the top 13, and six of the top
32. Do we hold that against Wilson? No. We hold it against people
like Rocky Colavito, who might well be in the Hall of Fame instead
of Wilson if he had been fortunate enough to play in an era when
105 RBIs couldn't win an MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rantings of Weiler and his ilk, baseball's
meaningless home runs aren't hit during seasons in which home runs
are a regular, even excessive, occurrence. They're hit during
seasons in which they are all too rare. They don't happen when
McGwire hits 70, or Ruth 60; they happen when Ruth hits 29 or
McCovey 36. That a home run mark is statistically meaningful is no
guarantee that it will ultimately be thought to possess historical
importance, and that one is statistically insignificant is no
strike against its assuming canonical status.
</P>
<P>
   The fans (and the fan in Weiler) already understand this point
better than the pundits (and the professor in Weiler). And that's
why they're flocking to ballparks like Enron Field, where what
might be cheap today will be classic tomorrow.

ATHLETIC FORWARD MOISO IS CELTICS' CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the first hour of the NBA draft ended Wednesday
night, the Celtics pondered their options with the No. 11 pick.
They saw a talent with size and shot-blocking ability still
available. They saw a player who had impressed them in two workouts
at HealthPoint. The saw someone with athleticism to spare. They saw
a young man targeted from the start as a good fit for the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Bienvenue, Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   Boston chose Moiso, a bilingual product of Guadeloupe, Paris,
Milford (Conn.) Academy, and UCLA. The Celtics expect their first
and only pick of the 2000 draft to play power forward. But the
brain trust would not rule out Moiso playing center in some
alignments and possibly small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good about (being drafted by the Celtics) right
now,'' said Moiso, who spoke with a lilting French accent. ``I'm
really very excited. I knew they had some interest in me after my
first workout . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the skills and what it takes to (play against strong
players). It's up to me to bring it every night and I think I can
do that because I want to be the best against the best. I play good
against the best, and I play good defense.''
</P>
<P>
   While Moiso was happy to learn he would start his NBA career in
the Hub, Boston was surprised that the 6-foot-10-inch forward found
his way here. Coach Rick Pitino did not expect Moiso to be around
at No. 11, but the early selection of two point guards changed the
complexion of the draft. As a result, the Celtics got the player
they desired and shored up a front court that might be without the
services of soon-to-be free agent Danny Fortson. Even if 7-1 center
Joel Pryzbilla of Minnesota was available, Pitino said, the Celtics
``were going with Moiso.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we wanted to do was get more athletic,'' said
Pitino. ``Probably last year was the least amount of pressing I've
ever done since I've been in diapers at Boston University. So, we
really didn't play like we did the first year because we weren't as
athletic as we'd like to be. This young man is a great athlete. He
did some things in workouts that we didn't notice on film. He's
very, very talented, a very gifted athlete, as well as being a good
basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Wallace: ``We're very happy to have (Moiso) for this ball
club . . . He's one of the most skilled players at his size
available in this draft.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who watched Moiso perform at UCLA, the assessments of
Pitino and Wallace were not revelations. During his freshman year,
he averaged 10.8 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. He was the
Bruins' leading rebounder in 11 games and leading scorer in five.
As a sophomore, he posted even more impressive statistics. His
scoring average jumped to 13 points, along with 7.6 rebounds per
game and 1.7 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a great time for me (to leave college),'' said
Moiso of his decision to go pro after two years in Southern
California. ``I had kind of planned that before I got to UCLA I
would play for two years and I would see what it is after two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Celtics' praise-filled evaluation of Moiso came mostly
from workouts at their training site.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing a very tough guy,'' said Pitino. ``We brought
him in twice and he would turn, wheel around someone, and get to
the rim and just dunk it. He was a lot more aggressive than we
heard. He has great hands, blocks shots. We do a couple of drills
where you have to go high on the glass five times, jog down to the
other end, and go high on the glass. All the guys we brought in
could not do what he could do on the glass. Besides being
6-foot-11, he's very long. So, he's what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino declined to answer whether Moiso, who starting playing at
age 6, stopped at 9, and resumed playing at 13, would make an
immediate impact or need time to develop. The Celtics' pick,
however, was quick to point out areas of his game that need
improvement and the skills that made him stand out. On the positive
side, Moiso called himself, ``pretty quick, pretty offensively
oriented, and athletic on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he believes he can handle the press, Moiso said it
would take time to adjust to the Celtics' favored defensive scheme.
He also mentioned the need to ``get bigger and stronger'' and hoped
to add about 10 pounds to his slim 235-pound frame.
</P>
<P>
   The newest Celtic will also need to spend time brushing up
Celtic Pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting following about the NBA when I was about 13,''
said Moiso. ``That's when I really started to know about it. And
the Celtics, I've been reading magazines and seeing a few games I
could catch in France. I didn't really know much about it, just
Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. (With the current
team), I just practically know the two main players, Paul Pierce
and Antoine Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before midnight, the Celtics pulled off a trade,
acquiring Josip Sesar, a 6-6 guard from Croatia. Sesar was selected
by Seattle with the 47th pick. In return, Boston gave Seattle its
two second-round picks in 2001. (Boston had previously acquired
Denver's second-round pick.)
</P>
<P>
   Sesar played for Cibona Zagreb in the Euroleague last season,
averaging 14.2 points per game. Prior to the 1999-2000 season, he
was one of the top scorers in the Croatian League with a 20.4
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in Europe told us about him,'' said Wallace.
``He's a tremendous shooter. He's the best shooter of all the
dozen-plus players we had come through here in the workout process.
He didn't actually come here, but we saw the workout process. He
handles the ball, he's got good size at the 2-guard position. We
need outside shooting, so we made that move.''

NO BASIS TO JUICED BASEBALL SUSPICIONS, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM KALEC  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several theories exist to explain the high number of baseballs
leaving major league parks this season. But a study conducted by
Dr. Jim Sherwood and Lawrence Fallon of UMass-Lowell has dismissed
one of the more popular notions: the baseball is not juiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baseball is not the problem, because there really isn't
any difference between this year's baseball and last year's
baseball,'' said Sherwood, who runs the Baseball Research Center at
the school, upon the report's release Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study only tested balls made since 1998, which raises the
question, were all the baseballs tested juiced?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning to continue this research,'' Sherwood said.
``We were unable to run tests on some of the older balls, but are
planning to and will see how they compare.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball presented the project to Sherwood and
Fallon in April. For six weeks, the same type of baseballs used
each day were tested. Some tests, such as comparing the weights of
this year's balls with their counterparts from the past two
seasons, were simple. Other tests were a bit more complicated, like
the one using a BAUM machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it does is simulate a batter hitting a pitch at speeds
pitchers throw at,'' Sherwood said. ``The machine spins a bat with
the same speed a hitter would when he swings at a pitch. At the
other end the ball is thrown by a device that looks similiar to a
tuning fork.''
</P>
<P>
   When contact is made, the machine measures the incoming velocity
of the ball to the rebound velocity when hit. The machine showed
the speed ratio has been consistent from 1998-2000.
</P>
<P>
   But with all respect to modern science, Orioles veteran Will
Clark could have saved everyone time and money. Clark suggested
those trying to find a connection between the balls and the
increase in power are more likely to find ``a needle in a
haystack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since pitchers don't pitch inside anymore, like a (Don)
Drysdale or a Juan Marichal or like Bob Gibson _ knocking people
down all the time _ since they are not allowed to do that, hitters
stay more on top of the plate and are swinging out of there butts
trying to hit the ball out of the ballpark,'' Clark said. ``If you
look at some of the stats, you'll find out that strikeouts have
gone up quite a bit too because guys don't care about striking out.
They care about going up there and dippin' and rippin'.''
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, young talent are spending just as much time in
the weight room as the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys you see now coming into the game are much bigger and
stronger,'' Clark said. ``When I first started in the league if you
saw a couple of opposite-field home runs, that was a bunch. Now
everybody and their grandma is hitting them. Even itty-bitty
shortstops are hitting the ball out the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the major league level, we'll see what happens with
the run production. If it continues then they are going to have to
do something to make it just as fair for the pitcher as the
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Batters hit 2,875 homers in the first 1,122 games this season,
an average of 2.56 per game through Wednesday. That's up 12 percent
from the 2.28 hit in a comparable period to start the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the results of the study,'' said Sandy Alderson,
executive vice president of baseball operations. ``(We are)
confident that the baseballs being used in major league games are
consistent with 1999 baseballs in terms of both quality and
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials and researchers went to the Rawlings plant in
Costa Rica, its testing facility in Missouri, the factory in
Mississippi where they make the ball's cork center and the mill in
Vermont where they spin the yarn that is wound around the
compressed cork core.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the 2000 baseballs and the 1999
baseballs are essentially the same,'' Sherwood said. ``The
difference between their batted-ball distance is negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, this year's ball actually traveled 1.4
feet shorter than last year's in batted-ball simulations. This is
well within the range baseball deems acceptable.

NEW ENGLAND'S SOUR MILK POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Socialism is dead in the former Soviet Union, but if you live in
New England, it is alive and well in your grocer's dairy case. The
price you pay for a gallon of milk is not determined by competition
and the free market. It is set instead by a cartel called the
Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, which was created for the
explicit purpose of overcharging New England consumers in order to
make rich New England dairy farmers richer.
</P>
<P>
   That is not, of course, how the compact describes itself. It
claims to be in the business of keeping local dairy farms from
going under and of ensuring a steady supply of milk. And how does
it achieve these admirable goals? By artificially hiking the price
of milk and using the extra money to subsidize dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   If this strikes you as government price-fixing, corporate
welfare, and hopeless economics, you're not alone. Individuals and
organizations across the political spectrum _ from the very liberal
Thomas Birmingham, president of the Massachusetts Senate, to the
conservative Beacon Hill Institute, a Suffolk University think tank
_ have called for ending this sour milk-pricing system. It's a call
worth heeding.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators have been setting minimum prices for most of
the milk sold in the United States since the Depression. By means
of a bureaucratic device known as marketing orders, dairy companies
are effectively forced to buy milk from local farmers, with payment
determined by a convoluted formula based on _ no joke _ how far
they are from Eau Claire, Wis. A Boston creamery might prefer to
buy milk from the Midwest, paying less and sharing the savings with
its customers. The law says it may not.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast Dairy Compact takes this bizarre federal scheme
and makes it even worse. While milk prices in other parts of the
country can rise and fall with supply and demand, the compact
guarantees dairy farmers a high price for their milk no matter
what. Milk processors in New England have been forced to pay about
20 cents per gallon more than processors elsewhere. That surtax
gets passed on to consumers, which is why milk costs more in Boston
and Hartford than it does almost anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of dairy socialism laud this highly regressive
rip-off, which transfers money from families that have a lot of
children to families that have a lot of cows. In language that
sounds like it was adapted from a Khrushchev-era Five-Year Plan,
the compact's Web site brazenly declares that ``the ability of the
states to regulate milk prices collectively, rather than
individually, is in the public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 federal statute authorized the compact in response to the
supposed ``crisis'' of dairy farms going out of business. Unless
this decline were reversed, Congress was told, local supplies of
milk would dry up, precious open space would be lost, and a
lifestyle rich in tradition _ dairy farming _ would be gone
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this was nonsense, beginning with the notion that dairy
farming was in danger of disappearing. To be sure, the number of
farms with milk cows has steadily shrunk _ there were 4.7 million
of them in 1940; fewer than 140,000 in 1996. The number of milk
cows has likewise been dropping _ from 23.6 million in 1940 to just
9.4 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But these numbers simply reflect the fact that dairy farming,
like all farming, has become dazzlingly productive. Despite the 60
percent plunge in the number of dairy cows since 1940, US milk
production has skyrocketed from 109 billion pounds per year to more
than 160 billion pounds. Fewer farmers, milking fewer cows, are
producing more milk than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Family farms (itals)have(unitals) been shutting down. But that
too is a function of modern agriculture. Dairying today requires
economies of scale. Mom-and-pop farms are easy to romanticize, but
they require a grueling amount of work and don't make much money.
They are vanishing not because milk is underpriced, but because
they represent an obsolete and uncompetitive way of providing milk
to consumers. Making families overpay for milk isn't going to
change reality.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, if the dairy compact was supposed to save small
farms, it  &UR;  &LR; hasn't. Between 1995 and 1997 _ the two years before
the price-jacking began _ 34 Massachusetts dairy farms and 117 in
Vermont went out of business. In the next two years, farm losses
totaled 44 in Massachusetts and 153 in Vermont. The compact not
only failed to stop dairy farms from dying, it failed to even slow
the rate of death.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that revenue from the milk surtax is divvied up
according to milk production. Bigger farms produce far more milk
than the mom-and-pop operations, and so get far more money. Small
farms receive only a few thousand dollars a year, not nearly enough
to make them economically viable. Yet they are the ones that are
failing: Farms with herds of 50 or fewer cows account for three out
of every four dairy farms lost in New England.
</P>
<P>
   To date, New Englanders have paid $100 million more for milk
than they would have if the compact had never been formed. By far
the largest share, $45 million, has come from Massachusetts
consumers. Of that, a mere $6 million has been retained by
Massachusetts farmers. The rest has gone out of state, mostly to
big-time dairy operations in Vermont and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Massachusetts Senate voted to get the Bay State
out of this sucker's deal. The House of Representatives ought to
waste no time getting on board. Politicians often hear that their
constituents are getting milked. Here is a chance for them to do
something about it.

 HAITIAN SCHOOL HOPES FOR MUSICAL REVIVAL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Along a narrow concrete alley, where
people live jammed together under tin roofs, a skinny young girl in
pigtails sat in her front entryway and tucked a viola under her
chin.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Debora Tatgrin, played the instrument as if it were an
extension of herself, the long fingers of her left hand skipping
over its neck, performing Bach for the neighborhood dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Children on tiptoes appeared. They listened, eyes wide open.
Beneath them, trickles of filthy water flowed unnoticed past their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   When she finished, no one clapped. They only stared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so good when I play,'' said Debora, 11, holding the
viola to her chest. ``In my mind, nothing else matters when I'm
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gift of music, handed to Debora when she turned 7, may
run out for other Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Her school, Haiti's only school of music, which has had a long
relationship with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is going through
extraordinarily hard times. Its decay is emblematic of the decline
of institutions throughout Haiti that withered to nearly nothing
during the 1991-94 military coup government and have yet to find
new life in a barely functioning democracy. Nationwide
demonstrations this week have done little to reassure overseas
supporters that the nation can be poised for better times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is hard to give up hope in certain corners of this
country, such as the alleyway outside Debora's home or the halls of
Holy Trinity School, which resound every day with scratchy bows on
violins and the bellowing of horns _ most of the instruments
stamped with the insignia of the school's chief benefactor, BSO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music to Haitians is a real necessity,'' said David Cesar, the
school's director, walking in a hallway. ``We play music all the
time. When we're happy. When we're sad. It doesn't matter. But
people in the United States see little of this part of Haiti. They
never hear about our music. They rarely hear about our art. They
hear only bad things about Haiti, about violence and lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is not the case for the school's donors, many of whom are
from the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship began with a knock on the symphony's door in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a nun to see me,'' said Bill Moyer, then BSO's
personnel director, referring to Holy Trinity's founder, Sister
Anne Marie. ``She came in with her black robes and said, `I wonder
if you'd like to give any instruments to our school in Haiti.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the school, Moyer liked the idea, and
suggested setting up a partnership. Perhaps, he said, the Boston
orchestra could send teachers to Port-au-Prince for weeklong
tutorials _ as long as the school would feed them and provide beds.
Sister Anne Marie agreed, and the relationship was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of BSO players went down during their vacation weeks to
teach, and they came back totally turned on and refreshed by the
spirit this school gave, I guess, to tired musicians,'' said Moyer,
70, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   BSO invited Haitian musicians to its summer getaway at
Tanglewood. In 1976 and 1984, the 70-member Holy Trinity
Philarmonic Orchestra, Haiti's only orchestra, took up summer
residence at Tanglewood and played to appreciative crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a very uneven talent, but they had a beautiful
spirit,'' Moyer said. ``They played scratchy, but it was wonderful.
Many were kids. The assistant concert master, Romel Joseph, was
blind, and he played fantastic. Audiences loved them.''
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in 1986, when Haiti ushered out the Duvalier
dictatorship, and continuing for nearly a decade, the country
turned sporadically violent. The musicians' exchanges between
Boston and Port-au-Prince nearly stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power in
1994, the friends of Holy Trinity began to raise money for the
school. During the next three years, they collected more than
$100,000, as well as dozens of instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Anne Marie died in 1996. Since then, the school has
struggled, Moyer said. The money was put into a New York bank,
where it remains.
</P>
<P>
   Some BSO musicians have gone to the school in the past few
years, but Moyer said most return ``discouraged. There isn't the
lively spirit the school used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, donors have stopped giving. Teachers are
taking second and third jobs because of their low wages. Most
students, after spending days in overcrowded classrooms, must leave
their instruments at school because of rising rates of theft.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Haiti's Episcopal Bishop Zache Duracin, who oversees
the Port-au-Prince school, will meet with Moyer and other US
supporters in New York plan to chart Holy Trinity's future. The
bishop's goal is for the school to become autonomous and seek funds
from Haitian individuals and groups, instead of relying on
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, has become a theme for Haiti's organizations, which
are being forced to cope more and more without outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those beautiful efforts that has simply got to
succeed,'' Moyer said. ``There are too many great little kids down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Debora Tatgrin, the girl who plays the viola, and her mother
and two sisters, the troubles with the school might as well be a
world away. They believe music will transport them from Haiti, just
as it has a precious few of the school's thousands of graduates in
years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband liked music. He used to play the guitar,'' said
Guylene Charles Tatgrin, a widow whose husband died seven years ago
from a mysterious stomach illness. ``But I always wanted my kids to
play music. The school was my opportunity for them. That's why I
chose this school.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother took a job as sixth-grade teacher there to be closer
to them. She took a second job to be able to send them to music
camp in the summer. And she learned to read music, even though she
can't play, to better help them practice.
</P>
<P>
   Debora is the middle of three sisters. The oldest, Francoise,
15, plays the violin; the youngest, Rebecca, 10, plays the
clarinet. Each said she chose her instrument based on personal
preference, not to avoid possible competition with a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Francoise achieved a breakthrough of sorts. She was
chosen to perform in Puerto Rico before a church group. ``When I
get in my 20s, I'll still be performing,'' Francoise said in the
family's 10-by-12-foot living room, which is crowded with a couch,
two chairs, and a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Debora, Francoise said, is exceptionally talented, a judgment
echoed by instructors at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the will, that's for sure,'' Francoise said. ``She's
not scared, not shy to say she doesn't understand something.''
</P>
<P>
   Debora allowed the slightest of smiles. Then she straightened
her back, composing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I will open my own music school when I turn 21, and
I will travel to many countries to play. I know this,'' she said
matter-of-factly, as if she has seen her future. ``I only hope that
my music will be pleasing to people. God gave me the intelligence.
God gave me the passion to play music. And God gave me the
confidence to play.''
</P>
<P>
   When the sisters' skill levels begin to intersect, they hope to
play as a trio. As their visitors prepared to leave the home, the
youngest sister, Rebecca, said that the family already has started
singing together.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the three stepped into the alleyway and, with
Francoise taking the lead, began singing ``Tell Me About Love'' in
Creole. They sang three-part harmony, their voices distinct and
loud and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   At the sound of music, an audience of children arrived on silent
feet. And they stared anew.

PRIVATE PLACEMENTS TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marty Fahey traveled from city to city on a schedule that
started in May and stretched into June, stuck all the way with a
dismal stock price that only got worse as the miles piled up.
</P>
<P>
   Fahey was something we see alot of these days, the chief
executive of a Internet company burning through cash with no
opportunity to sell more stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fahey's travels comes with a qualified happy
ending. His company, Webhire Inc. of Lexington, Mass., locked up a
$16 million private placement managed by Piper Jaffray and priced
at $2.35 per share Wednesday. The catch: existing Webhire
stockholders were diluted by nearly a third to raise what would
have been considered short money just six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of Internet companies like Webhire, caught
between a financial rock and a hard place. Some go out of business,
or merge, or just cut their spending to the bone hoping to ride out
the storm. Private placements, the sale of company stock to a few
selected buyers with deep pockets, are one of the more attractive
options if you can pull one off.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other companies, Webhire had interesting potential but
no bottom line results to show for it. The company works the
recruiting business from the Web but unlike better-known sites like
Monster.com, it targets recruiters instead of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Webhire had a big advantage in its search for cash that most
other Internet companies don't enjoy. Softbank Capital Partners,
the giant Internet venture group, had already sunk $20 million into
another Webhire private placement last summer and wasn't going to
walk away from its investment.
</P>
<P>
   As Fahey traveled from Boston to New York, Philadephia and
Minneapolis, he knew full well that Webhire was on course to burn
through the last of its cash by late July. But he also knew
Softbank general partner Charles Lax would write a check by himself
to keep Webhire afloat if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even that was unlikely to be necessary. Webhire had been talking
to Korn/Ferry International, the big executive search company,
since early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Korn/Ferry proved to be the ideal strategic investor for
Webhire, agreeing to buy half the private placement. Softbank
ponied up another $4 million. That left just a few million more and
Webhire found two investors to buy the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no point when we were worried about closing the
doors,'' said Fahey. ``It's a luxury many companies don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   There may have been a safety net, and eventual success, but
Webhire's journey was no joy ride. The company's stock was getting
pummeled, down to $6 per share when Fahey started on the roadshow
and just barely above $2 by the time he made his last pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The tumble this year is actually far worse. Webhire shares were
approaching $19 per share early this year. Even with a bounce from
the announcement, Webhire's 77 percent loss so far this year ranks
as one of the 10 worst among all public companies based in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood of investors is dramatically different,'' said Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   Webhire is actually an older company that adopted the Internet
later in life. For years it served recruiters via computer but
worked in the older ``client-server'' computer world.
</P>
<P>
   The company saw its industry moving to the Web and went with it,
changing from the old name Restrac Inc. to Webhire last year.
Attracting a big Internet investor like Softbank and creating an
online relationship with Yahoo! Inc. was another big strategic
step.
</P>
<P>
   The company embraced the Web and its big-spending ways. It saw a
potential market share landgrab as the recruiting business moved to
the Web and took its best shot.
</P>
<P>
   That suited Softbank just fine and Lax urged the company to
build fast. But Webhire's old venture capital backer, TA
Associates, had different idea. TA had invested in the old Restrac
as a software company years earlier and didn't plan to remain a
long-term investor in the new Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charley Lax's desire is go, go, go, this is a long term
play,'' said Fahey. ``TA is saying, when are you going to get to
profitability. These are two very different views of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lax discovered TA Associates wanted to get out just after
Softbank invested $20 million in Webhire last summer and wasn't
happy. But by Dec. 22, TA Associates distributed its stock to
limited partners and was out of the investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Lax and Softbank came in thinking they could help the
company complete that transition,'' said TA Associates chief
executive Kevin Landry. ``They're a great investor and they know
that space. It's a more appropriate deal for them than TA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, all these (Internet) stocks got a bit over-priced
last winter and we didn't want to stay in for three or four years.
When the stock ran up, we decided to distribute it. In hindsight,
I'm damn glad I did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Webhire has a new crop of investors and a bit of financial
breathing room. A sign of the times: ask Fahey when Webhire will
make a profit and he has a ready answer. Toward the end of next
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a common profit timetable among Web companies that have a
new lease on life. By then, they will likely be back on their feet
or flat on their face for good.

THERE IS NO POINT IN CAULKING THE GAP IN ATTIC SHEATHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. At both ends of my attic, there are boards that run across
the frame of the house. They all have gaps about 3/4-inch wide.
Would there be any problem if I caulked the gaps? These are the
boards that the shingles and tar paper are nailed onto. The house
was built about 1939.
</P>
<P>
   W.J.R., Wollaston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no need to caulk between those boards that are a
part of the sheathing of your house. The tarpaper and shingles
cover the wall on the outside, and that is all you need. There is
nothing you have to do. Frankly, it would be a waste of time and
caulking to do so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is about 20 years old and I would like to replace
some tarnished door knobs. The opening in the door for the knob is
1 3/4 inches. All replacement door knobs I have seen require a 2
1/8-inch opening. How can I make those holes bigger?
</P>
<P>
   ALEX KOREN, New Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Before doing anything, check to see if your knobs are solid
brass, which I think they are, since most knobs are. Put a magnet
on the knob; if it sticks, the knob is not brass. If it doesn't
stick, it is solid brass. If solid brass, the knobs were probably
lacquered, and eventually the lacquer wore off, and the brass
tarnished. You could take off any remaining lacquer with lacquer
thinner, then polish the brass with Noxon or other metal polish.
The knobs will tarnish again, but tarnished brass really does not
look too bad. If you like you can spray them with a clear spray
plastic, which will last a few years.
</P>
<P>
   OK, if you have to replace the knobs, you can enlarge the small
holes with a hole saw, a device that comes in all sizes, including
2 1/8 inch, and attaches to a power drill. While it is a little
difficult to make the hole bigger with one of these hole saws than
to make it from scratch, you should be able to do it with care. To
make it easier, clamp a scrap piece of wood on the door over the
existing hole so the bit of the hole saw will start drilling in the
right position.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is built over a 4-foot crawl space with a sand
floor. My question is about preventing moisture under the house. I
live about a quarter-mile from the beach. The floor of the crawl
space appears to be dry. There is 3 inches of faced insulation
between the floor joists. The space is vented with four 12- by
6-inch vents. I read articles that say 6-mil plastic sheets shoud
be laid on the sand floor to seal out moisture. One of the articles
also mentions leaving a 6-inch gap between the plastic sheet and
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Is this something I should do? What is the correct way to
install the plastic sheet? Where can I buy it?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD CONRON, Bourne, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Even though the sand floor appears dry, water vapor is
constantly coming up through it. Your crawl space is not damp
because of those vents, which are doing their job of venting the
water vapor away before it condenses into water.
</P>
<P>
   While it is not urgent, I think it is a good idea to put down
the plastic to stop that water-vapor migration. Six-mil plastic may
be hard to find; if you cannot, 4-mil plastic, widely available,
will do. Put it on the entire floor of the crawl space, so that it
folds up the foundation for 6 to 12 inches, and overlap sections by
at least 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Weight it with stones or bricks if you like. Keep the vents open
all year long, although you can close them from November to April,
because there is less moisture in the air in winter. But keeping
them open all year long will not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   I have never heard of leaving a 6-inch gap between plastic and
foundation; it does not make sense and will defeat the purpose of
the plastic completely, as if you never bothered with it in the
first place. Leave no gaps.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have helped me soundproof my apartment, but in
soundproofing I did not figure in the windows, and my daughter's
dogs are in a pen 5 feet away. Will acoustic drapes help, if there
is such a thing, or perhaps acoustic blinds? What would be better
for dulling the sounds of barking.
</P>
<P>
   TIM ILINITCH, Templeton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Don't get me started on barking mutts. It is a very sore
subject. It is not the dogs who are fault; it is their masters.
</P>
<P>
   But there are things you can do: If your windows are double
glazed (two layers of glass), or are single-glazed with a storm and
well weatherstripped, that is a good start. Adding a layer is your
next priority, and will make a big difference. Any kind of a solid
layer will help reduce sound. Thermal draperies will work as
acoustic barriers, but they must be attached to the casing on all
four sides; otherwise they are not going to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Window Quilts are good thermal/acoustical draperies; they are
sold in energy stores, stove and fireplace shops, and other shops.
They come opaque or translucent.
</P>
<P>
   Or, try an inside storm window. Not only will you save heat but
you will reduce sound considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Then put the dog pen 100 feet _ 1,000 feet _ away!
</P>
<P>
   You can buy inside storms from: Zip Storm, which provides
plastic strips for installing acrylic sheets; you buy the acrylic
separately: TryWindow Saver Co., Carlisle, Mass., 800-321-9276, or
Innerglass, Simsbury, Conn., 800-743-6207, 860-651-3951.
</P>
<P>
   These are real glass, and in the handyman's opinion, better than
acrylic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is less than a year old, and already some of the
doors do not close properly: The latches do not fit into their
keepers snugly; you have to lift the doors to make the latches
engage. The contractor nailed into the hinge-side jambs to try to
make the doors and doorways vertical. Is there an easier way to
make the doors latch properly?
</P>
<P>
   KAREN SMITH, Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, and nailing into the hinge-side jamb is not one of them.
The jambs are not vertical because of shoddy workmanship. Making
them vertical requires taking everything apart and rebuilding the
jambs.
</P>
<P>
   Short of that, here's the quick fix: First, make sure the doors
are tight in their openings. Then, if the jambs are not too far out
of vertical, you can adjust the keeper (also called latch plate) so
the latch will fit. Since you have to lift the door to get it to
latch, it means the opening in the keeper (the hole in the jamb) is
too high. Relocating the keeper is impossible because the screws
cannot be moved that short a distance.
</P>
<P>
   So remove the keeper and file the bottom of the opening, enough
so the latch will fit, about 1/8 inch.
</P>
<P>
   But since the house is less than a year old, the builder should
rebuild all those jambs so they are vertical and correct. And don't
take no for an answer; some builders will delay the work until the
homeowner gives up, and until the warranty (normally one year)
expires. But if you ask the builder to correct substandard work
before the warranty expires, then he is obliged to do so promptly.

WORDS TO BE REMEMBERED BY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I am on my deathbed, I think I will feel most proud of my
support network of family, friends, and members of my
Unitarian-Universalist church. Because we could count on one
another, every one of us has been able to take risks and be guided
in our actions by our dreams of a more just and caring world. I've
been able to make hard decisions, like the one not to sign what I
consider an unfair contract in order to continue writing for the
Globe, because I do not feel I stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, a group of my friends formed a study group to
discuss Wayne Muller's book, ``How, Then, Shall We Live? Four
Simple Questions That Reveal the Beauty and Meaning of Our Lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller's first question is, ``Who Am I?'' Are we merely the
offspring of certain parents, or could a few ordinary women
actually think of themselves as ``the light of the world?'' Did we
dare to believe, with Nelson Mandela, that our ``playing small''
was a disservice to the world?
</P>
<P>
   Muller's second question is ``What Do I Love?'' We came to see
that what we love shapes our souls as a magnet molds filings, that
every choice we make either strengthens or deforms our deepest
being.
</P>
<P>
   His third question is ``How Shall I Live, Knowing I Will Die?''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about our deaths dispelled the illusion that tomorrow
was ours to dispose of as we pleased. We discussed what changes are
required when you realize you can't be unafraid, or make amends, or
do what is right at some later date. If this moment is in fact the
only moment we can count on, what did we want to do with our lives,
starting now?
</P>
<P>
   We decided to write our obituaries so that we might
imaginatively encounter the ending that is always only one breath
away.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I wrote:
</P>
<P>
   Linda Weltner passed away today, leaving behind her grieving
family and a troubled earth, whose cause she championed all her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weltner, who strove with all her might to leave the world a
better place, was a spokesperson for caring and authenticity. In
her weekly Globe column, and later as an inspiring public speaker,
she urged others to see the beauty of their lives and the value of
their relationships, despite the imperfection inherent in all human
endeavors. She was aligned in her social activism with like-minded
and beloved colleagues who did not shrink from taking on powerful
enemies, including massive power companies like Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric, the multibillion-dollar telecommunications industry, and
media conglomerates such as The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weltner was an impassioned wife and a loving parent, a
caring sibling, and a faithful friend, roles that she held sacred.
She was a stranger to halfhearted involvement and threw herself
into life with unrestrained enthusiasm, often to the dismay of
others. Having grown up poor, she felt that her good fortune was a
debt to be repaid. She was burdened all her life by an
overdeveloped sense of responsibility, which _ from necessity _ she
finally learned to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weltner's grandchildren will remember the many hours they
spent with her building volcanoes, dollhouses, train layouts, and
other projects, as well as her dramatic reading of the entire
``Harry Potter'' series. Her children will remember her as an
indefatigable parent. Despite their protests to the contrary, as
their embarrassment recedes into the past they will come to view
her outrageousness as a great loss in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weltner, who found herself facing the end with a surprising
degree of equanimity, spent her last hours writing a long letter of
affection to those she loved. It is hoped that her spirit will live
on in the memories of those whose lives she touched.

BUILD NEW STORAGE SPACE TO HOLD THE LEFTOVERS

</P>
<P>
   There are no rules.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden Nash &QL; 
 &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No rules for mules?
</P>
<P>
   That's a great idea, but a better one would be to establish
rules _ for packrats.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this: Mr. and Mrs. Bookworm decide that it is time to
clean out the bookcases. There are books on the floor, on tables,
on chairs, under tables, on the toilet (hey, I know someone who
stores books that way).
</P>
<P>
   So, Mrs. Bookworm takes all the books she wants to give away and
stacks them in a neat pile, maybe 2 feet high. Pretty good. Mr.
Bookworm does the same with his.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make check each other's throw-aways. Oh, no, each
says, you can't dump that book. It is signed by the author. You
can't do this, and you can't do that, until most of each pile goes
back into the bookcases. And they go out to get another bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there should be a rule.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with any possession: Cards, bicycles, old boards,
new boards, fuses, a mouse skeleton (It was a Colonial mouse,
Pop!), rocks, 78 r.p.m. records, pants too big, pants too small,
wind-up toys, broken toys, Grandma's old sheets and pillowcases
(might be worth something some day). Everything needs winnowing.
</P>
<P>
   We are a nation of packrats, saving everything we ever owned.
``Might use it some day,'' goes the philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be worth a lot someday,'' goes another philosophy.
Yes, it's worth keeping some items, especially linens, dresses, and
accessories, which can bring good money. But how many people find
an old item and sell it for $25,000, even $2,500?
</P>
<P>
   Can we break this habit? Maybe. It involves storage space, space
that you have to make or find at your house.
</P>
<P>
   The space must be right: the right size and the right shape.
With such space, you can sort material and keep some of it, having
done the most important thing: get rid of unnecessary, superfluous,
redundant, useless, and worthless things.
</P>
<P>
   The basement is not always good storage space. It is often damp
and not good for storing clothing (it will decay) or metal items
(they will rust). Attics are OK; the more they are ventilated, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   There may be space in the house for storage that you never
realized was there: under stairs, in a corner of an overly large
bedroom, the basement stairs (if they are wide enough, you can
build shelves along the empty walls).
</P>
<P>
   Even an empty wall in a kitchen, where nothing else will go, can
hold a shallow cabinet to contain bottles, glassware, and mugs.
Sometimes you can cut into the wall and build a shallow cabinet in
that interior space. This is best done with interior walls; an
exterior wall will not work to hold storage because it is
insulated, or should be.
</P>
<P>
   If you build a closet, make sure it is at least 2 feet deep.
Such a closet will be deep enough to accommodate jackets hung
sideways. It will also hold most storage boxes, which you can buy
at home goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   Old houses have closets, but they were usually only about 12
inches deep, way too small to store things easily. And really old
houses had no closets at all, but portable closets called armoires.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy new and antique armoires. Or you can build one, to
hold entertainment equipment or, or of all things, clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Finding storage space for our collective stuff is all well and
good, but it will not solve the original problem: how to weed out
useless and worthless things.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where a rule is needed, a rule that says you must clean
everything out once every five yaars.
</P>
<P>
   One way to weed out your stuff is to tear down the tool house,
to make room for a bigger one or a garage, which will be a great
place to store everything but cars.
</P>
<P>
   To tear down the tool house, you have to empty it. And if there
is no room to store things temporarily, you have to get rid of
them. It is amazing how much junk you can chuck when you have to.
</P>
<P>
   Another way is to throw away anything that you have not seen,
used or thought about in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Have a hard heart, and try not to do it by committee; other
members of the family are impossible to work with. Let them do
their own with their hard hearts and your high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   When you're all done, do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   It can work.

<P>
   Folks who visit recreated colonial villages such as Sturbridge
(Mass.) Village or Strawbery Banke in Portsmouth, N.H. often relish
thoughts of buying a falling-down Colonial house with good bones,
restoring it to its former grandeur, and furnishing it with period
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they may have to win the lottery first. How else to
afford a set of Windsor chairs when a single chair with its
original paint costs around $10,000, and even the smallest Shaker
box sells for $400? And forget about ceramics _ most slipware, or
redware, resides in museums or private collections.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a way to get that 18th-century look for your home,
and for affordable prices _ reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a new idea, of course. But we're talking genu-
</P>
<P>
   ine reproductions. Not those mass-produced retreads seen in
chain stores but handcrafted, one-of-a-kind pieces, produced by
skilled craftspeople.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been such an information explosion in the past 10
years along with so many advances in technology,'' says Mimi
Handler, editor and publisher of Early American Homes magazine,
``that craftspeople making traditional reproductions today know as
much about how they were made as the old guys. . . . And each piece
is signed. This does make them fairly expensive, but the
craftsmanship is worth the price tag.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for these high-quality pieces means that there are
more artisans making more and better reproductions because
``craftsmen can now make a pretty good living making quality
traditional pieces,'' says Handler. ``The Internet has also helped
educate buyers who are interested in American decorative arts.''
</P>
<P>
   For both addicts and those with a new interest in Americana, the
backroads of New England could not be a better classroom. Five of
the most talented traditional craftspeople among the region's
growing number are Ron Geering, a potter and blacksmith who lives
in Falmouth, Mass. and makes decorative English and American
slipware, or redware; Gerry Dunphy and Terry Wakeman, woodworkers,
who own Classics in Wood in Ashford, Conn., makers of Windsor
chairs and other furniture; and Pam and Harley Savage, a painter
and woodworker, respectively, owners of Frye's Measure Mill in
Wilton, N.H., where measures, piggins, and other woodenware have
been made since 1876.

</P>
<P>
   Ron Geering
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Geering has been reproducing museum-quality pieces of early
American earthenware, stoneware, and metalwork since graduating
from Wayne State University, in Detroit, in 1971. He came east in
1985 to help Plimoth Plantation set up its 17th-century forge and
to supervise the museum's craftspeople. He developed the line of
pottery that's sold in the museum's shop. A stint as director of
exhibits at the Children's Museum of Rhode Island came next, before
Geering became a freelance product designer and illustrator. He's
presently in the process of turning his Falmouth garage into a
small combination studio/shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been drawn to slipware because it's easy pottery
to live with,'' says Geering. ``It's earthy and not real precious,
even though it's expensive because it's so labor intensive to make.
Traditionally, in England and then here, large slipware plates were
made to commemorate special occasions like birthdays or weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   A wedding plate often included a colorful, primitive drawing of
the couple in the middle of the plate with their first names and
the date of their wedding printed around the rim. Others boasted
sayings around the rim: ``Love in the spring is for the maiden'';
``As a ring is round and hath no end, so is my love unto my
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The charm of this type of pottery is in the technique,'' says
Geering, ``what happens while you're working with the clay. That's
what makes it interesting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Slipware is lead-glazed earthenware made from red clay and then
decorated with colored slip (clay mixed with water) before it is
fired in a kiln. It is not to be confused with other earthenware _
majolica, faience, or delftware _ where the decoration is painted
on glaze after the first firing. The most unfortunate thing about
slipware is that it is often confused with the mud-brown,
mass-produced pottery that lines the shelves in tourist shops. To
be sure, slipware looks primitive with its folksy designs,
lettering, and squiggly lines, but this simplicity belies a
challenging technique.
</P>
<P>
   To begin a piece, Geering throws the red clay on his wheel into
the shape of a plate _ he also makes cups, bowls, and two- or
three-handled tygs , or mugs. He then lets the plate dry a little
before adding the slip, which is the consistency of cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pour the slip on a plate and then scratch through it for a
design,'' says Geering. ``I use a little wooden or metal tool to do
the scratching. This is called sgraffito, a technique that's been
around for hundreds and hundreds of years. Because it takes several
hours to complete a complicated design, I can control the hardening
of the clay by adding water.''
</P>
<P>
   For a technique called slip trailing, which Geering compares to
decorating a cake, he squeezes slip from a child's ear syringe and
places the end of a feather in the nozzle, which acts like a
pencil. In the old days, he says, potters used an animal bladder or
clay cup with a cock feather or goose quill in the nozzle. There's
also feathering combing _ a technique in which a needle is dragged
across the slip in various directions, creating a geometric design.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ensure authenticity, I've done extensive research,'' says
Geering. ``I stay with the motifs of the 17th century but also
incorporate my own ideas into them. My large plates, because
they're so time consuming, sell for $500. Smaller, simpler plates
are $150, and the small vessels are $24.''
</P>
<P>
   His pieces are dishwasher and microwave safe and lead-free.

   According to legend, King George I of England was fox-hunting
when it began to rain and he sought shelter in a subject's rustic
home. There he sat on a simple but comfortable chair, which he
liked so much that he immediately commissioned several for his more
palatial lodgings.
</P>
<P>
   This may indeed be myth, because when George took the throne in
1714, the Windsor-style chair was already being used as garden
seating at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their origins, the chairs, with their basic
stick-and-socket design of legs, arms, and back spindles anchored
by a solid plank seat, reached American shores in the 1730s. Here
they were copied and reinvented by Colonial furniture makers. But
their graceful form, sturdy construction, surprising comfort, and
versatility have ensured their popularity through the years.
Although some believe the chairs were painted to cover up the
different woods used for the various parts, most agree they were
originally painted to hold up outdoors and to accentuate their
lines. And according to Early American Homes magazine, the Windsor
chair is ``the greatest success story in the history of
furniture.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At a New Year's Eve party on the last day of 1994, Lotus
Development Corp. executive Leon Navickas finally found someone
willing to listen to his idea for a new kind of software.
Unfortunately for Lotus, that someone wasn't Navickas's boss.
Instead, it was a venture capitalist with money to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Navickas runs his own business, Lexington, Mass.-based
Centra Software Inc., which has taken an early lead in the market
for Internet-based education software. And despite last month's
announcement that Lotus's parent company, IBM Corp., is launching a
major drive to dominate the ``e-learning'' market, Navickas thinks
he can keep Centra on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that IBM-Lotus is fundamentally a services company,''
said Navickas. ``That's their DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM's new Mindspan Solutions unit, headed by Lotus's new CEO Al
Zollar, offers a broad array of e-learning products and services,
with Lotus's LearningSpace software at its core. But the corporate
genome at Centra is tuned solely for the task of producing
educational software. Navickas thinks it's the best, and he's found
a goodly number of customers to agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   According to market research from Frost &AMP; Sullivan, Centra holds
over half the market for e-learning software, with IBM holding just
6 percent. And Microsoft Corp. has tapped Centra as a business
partner, with Microsoft salespeople pushing Centra software in all
their key accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied Centra customers include Ann Arbor, Mich.-based
Domino's Pizza LLC, which uses the software to upgrade the skills
of 1,000 administrative workers. Paul Messink, Domino's director of
intranet development, said he leaned toward buying Lotus
LearningSpace because the company already uses Lotus's popular
Notes collaborative software system. But workers found the Centra
software far easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really let this decision be driven by the users rather than
by IS (information services executives),'' Messink said, ``and
users certainly preferred the Centra solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Navickas didn't have e-learning specifically in mind when he
dreamed up Centra. He'd spent years working a variety of major
Lotus products, including an early palmtop computer that ran Lotus
software, and the ill-fated Jazz spreadsheet for the Apple
Macintosh computer.
</P>
<P>
   Navickas was impressed with the possibilies of Lotus Notes,
which allows teams of workers to share documents and collaborate on
projects. But Navickas thought it was missing something _ a way to
let people work together in real time. He wanted software that
would let workers send live messages to each other, or edit the
same document simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notes wasn't really built with real-time capabilities,'' said
Navickas. And back in 1994, with the Internet little more than a
gimmick, the company wasn't too interested in adding them in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along came New Year's Eve and a sympathetic investor.
</P>
<P>
   Navickas set up Centra and got busy producing software that
could let people work in real time over corporate networks or the
Internet. By late 1996, the company's first product was ready.
Symposium software let students work together on a single document;
it allowed them to talk to each other over the network, or even
over a slow telephone modem connection to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Centra also came up with Choreography, a program that enabled
e-learning instructors to coordinate the activities of class
members. With students scattered all over the Internet, and no
direct eye contact, an online classroom can collapse into chaos.
With Choreography, a teacher can seize control. For instance, the
teacher can force students to take turns speaking or tinkering with
a class project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies got incredibly excited about this, and they saw the
need immediately,'' said Navickas.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Sanregret, vice president of distance learning for Global
Knowledge Inc., a North Carolina technical training firm, has been
using Centra products for the past year. ``Centra is certainly the
easiest vendor to recommend to a Fortune 500 company,'' said
Sanregret. ``They've invested the most in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanregret noted that IBM and Lotus, instead of focusing simply
on producing the best e-learning software, are more interested in
providing an entire set of educational services. Sanregret figures
that its superior software gives Centra the advantage for now; as
for the IBM approach, ``that'll be a good strategy in about a year
and a half,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM has good reason to play catch up. According to International
Data Corp., companies in the Internet learning business took in
$1.1 billion last year, and will rake in $11.4 billion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   With its software-only business, Centra will only get a sliver
of this market. But IDC analyst Cushing Alexander notes that IBM's
approach of offering complete solutions to the world's biggest
customers may actually offer an opportunity for Centra. At some of
their accounts, IBM Mindspan employees could decide that a client
is better off with Centra software rather than Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could recommend anybody's solution, theoretically, which
could give Centra an opportunity,'' said Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Navickas can even imagine a day when IBM gives up on Lotus
LearningSpace and sells Centra products to all its Mindspan
customers. ``I think that there may be another morphing of the
IBM-Lotus learning operation in the future,'' he said. ``It sort of
seems to me that they've tried this before . . . Lotus building
their own and then dropping it for best-of-breed products in that
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps IBM might even acquire closely held Centra, but Navickas
said he's not holding his breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a price for everything, but we're not angling to be
bought,'' he said. ``What we're doing now is we're building a large
and scalable stand-alone business, on the scale of Notes itself.''

IN PETERSEN MUSEUM, LOS ANGELES IS THE CITY OF WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If there is a place where the automobile has been
inextricably woven into the culture, it is Southern California. It
has given racing, radical hot rods, cool custom jobs, drive-in food
joints, and a link between car, owner, and prestige not found
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   From burgers to Bugattis, lakesters to limousines, Southern
California has had it all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a history remarkably represented at The Petersen
Automotive Museum, 300,000 square feet of exhibition space on
Wilshire Boulevard in downtown (if this place has a downtown) Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Its exhibits are dedicated to the automobile and its influence
on American culture and our lives. On display at any time are more
than 100 race cars, classic cars, hot rods, motorcycles, cars from
television and the movies, and cars that belonged to celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   From re-created scenes in the streets of the early city to
rambles through the as-yet-undeveloped hills, an exhibit shows the
evolution of Los Angeles, from tight city center to nascent sprawl,
complete with one of the most advanced electric trolley
transportations in the world, to the present. It is a present where
the 101, the 405, and the 10 (where else do numbered routes get an
article before them?) define travel and place.
</P>
<P>
   Take a tour and see a 1911 American Underslung Model 50 Traveler
from the American Motor Car Co. stuck in the mud in the undeveloped
hills above Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Check out early California racing by peering into the cockpit of
a 1915 Stutz White Squadron Racer, 130 horses of thunder once
driven on tracks by Earl Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond round-and-round racing, Southern California gave us
racing on the flats of dried lakebeds or in the desert. The
Southern California Speedshop exhibit gives us the history of the
lakester, highlighted by tank cars that were made from the
auxiliary fuel tanks of Lockheed P38 Lightnings. From sky to sandy
earth they helped define an era of straight-ahead speed, their Ford
flathead V-8s dominant in the early 1950s _ until the appearance of
the Chrysler Hemi.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most gorgeous _ and effective _ racers of the day is
here as well _ the famed Pierson Brothers Coupe. Radically chopped
so you wonder how the driver could even see, it ran under various
owners and with continually upgraded mechanics from 1949 to 1991,
increasing its top speeds from 153.06 mph to 227.33.
</P>
<P>
   It stands in cultural contrast to yet another highly
recognizable car here, the 1959 ``bucket'' of Ed ``Big Daddy''
Roth, cream-and-blue and sculpted with its engine exposed and
gleaming.
</P>
<P>
   There are dreams here as well: dreams failed and dreams
realized.
</P>
<P>
   You get the 1945 Tucker Torpedo that was the personal car of
Preston Tucker. That did not lead to any trends.
</P>
<P>
   And you get re-creations of early service stations and fast food
joints _ such as The Dog Cafi, shaped just like the name would
imply, or other drive-ups shaped like pumpkins or owls from the
1920s. They did signify a trend. Golden arches and white-bearded
colonels would one day take their place.
</P>
<P>
   The culture, of course, was replete with stars. The hoi polloi
were left wishing they could drive what the stars drove. So here we
find the 1960 Mercedes Benz 300 SL roadster of Robert Stack; Mel
Torme's 1937 Jaguar SS100 roadster; the 1953 Cadillac coupe by Ghia
of Rita Hayworth; Mel Blanc's 1958 Edsel; Fred Astaire's 1927 Rolls
Royce Phantom I Town Car; and for those moments when she wanted to
be alone in luxury on the road, Greta Garbo's 1925 Lincoln
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler of publishing fame offers up his motorcycle
collection. It includes a 1953 Norton Dominator, a 1948 Vincent
HRD, a 1907 Indian, a 1929 Cleveland, and a 1941 Indian Dispatch
Tow. I'll give a printed tip of the hat to the first person who
e-mails me to say how the latter was used.
</P>
<P>
   With a recent donation of $25 million from automotive publishing
magnate Robert E. Petersen, the 6-year-old museum has retired its
debt and can now concentrate on a major goal: ensuring that the
exhibits do not become static.
</P>
<P>
   Street scenes may provide the spine of the museum, but all
around them, things change.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, cars from movies and television will be
featured. They follow exhibits such as the Duesenberg as a car for
powerful people; photographic images that reflect cars and culture;
pedal cars; postwar sports cars; woodies; early hot road
performance equipment; and the low-rider as art.
</P>
<P>
   With an ever-changing display, and a vault of treasures from
which to pluck cars and motorcycles, you won't get much static at
the Petersen.

SMALLER, LIGHTER OLDS AURORA CHASES THE SPORTY NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Two roads diverged in a wood . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I know, somebody else already wrote that, but that's the
intersection at which General Motors found itself when it came time
for a redesign of the seven-year-old Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Go big or go smaller?
</P>
<P>
   Smaller and lighter was the answer, and aluminum was a key.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Aurora is 165 pounds lighter in the V-8 model tested
and 6 inches shorter. Aluminum is showing up increasingly all
through cars, and the Aurora is riding the wave: aluminum engine
components, suspension parts, hood and trunk panels.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car that might have stayed larger had the Buick
Riviera been continued and provided a larger platform. But the
Riviera was put to pasture, and the result is a more modern,
snappier car that has a better chance of catching on with the niche
for which it is intended: younger, more affluent drivers that
Oldsmobile is hoping to attract.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera-based model might have been, as they say, your
father's Oldsmobile. This one is not.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Olds will be to sell this new image in a sales
zone that is ever more crowded and highly competitive: midrange
luxury cars. Priced in the mid-30s, it will have to run with cars
such as the Lincoln LS, Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30, and the Acura
RL. And if you want to comparison shop, I'd try a Nissan Maxima and
an Acura TL, both fully loaded, and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   GM is making a move with the Aurora, trying to fit an American
car comfortably into this niche. They've got the comfort and
mechanics down here. Standard leather, walnut trim, lots of
driver-assist goodies. Now comes the selling.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the aggressive look.
</P>
<P>
   Stand at the front and gaze. It is very NASCAR-esque. No central
grille, that replaced by two grilled scoops at bumper line. A wide
stance and ridged flares leading back along the bulging front
fenders, through the doors and the back fenders. The rear is
chopped and sits high. The effect is one of a wedge when viewed
from the side.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it is a study in comfort and good ergonomics. Front
leather buckets are firmly bolstered up the sides and along seat
edges. Support is good in all places. The dash drops sharply away,
giving good legroom. Rear seats are comfortable, even for three,
and firm as well. Legroom is OK, not great.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are well organized. The console at center dash is
slanted toward the driver, giving a good look at climate and audio
controls, all easily used because of large buttons and knobs.
</P>
<P>
   Climate and audio controls for the driver are repeated in the
steering wheel, and the driver's side door is a warehouse of
controls: seating memory, windows, mirrors, and, in a vast
improvement over the many cars that tuck these controls away on the
floor or beneath the seat, gas and trunk lid buttons are right
there where you can see them.
</P>
<P>
   The front-seat passenger gets to control climate over there with
a knob on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage space is only OK _ shallow pockets in the
doors, a shallow glove box, an ample bin between the seats.
Rear-seat passengers get pockets on the backs of the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider performance.
</P>
<P>
   You get a choice of two engines, both DOHC, one a 3.5-liter V-6,
the other a 4.0-liter V-8. The V-8 delivered a very nice 21.4 miles
per gallon in several days of round-the-town and commuter driving.
</P>
<P>
   It was peppy, throaty, and reminiscent of the Monte Carlo SS I'd
driven a few weeks back. The four-speed automatic let the engine
wind out properly before shifting up, an important touch in a car
whose audience may be looking for at least a modicum of
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension _ 4-wheel independent with struts, coil springs,
and anti-roll bars _ struck me as a bit soft. That meant a very
smooth ride cruising on the highway with some hints of body roll
while cornering. Vented disc brakes stopped it quickly though there
was a tendency, when braking hard, to understeer. Not to fear. ABS
and traction control were noticeable in quickly correcting any
tendencies that could lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Aurora is sporty, powerful, and luxurious. Now it has to
make a name for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The through-box from trunk to cabin that is concealed between
the center-rear-seat armrest. Great for skis, fishing poles, other
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The outside mirrors are too narrow, which confines vision.
Fatter, aerodynamic mirrors are possible.

ORLANDO'S MANY MANEUVERS SIMPLY MAGICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Everyone talks like a winner on draft night. The
Orlando Magic acted like one Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic went into the draft holding three of the first 13
picks. But everyone understood the draft was merely the undercard
for the Magic, who are ready to stage the basketball equivalent of
Operation Overlord Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And they improved their already formidable chances in the free
agent market with three incredibly deft moves. By so doing, they
established themselves as a power-to-be, assuming their August
full-court press bears fruit. There doesn't seem to be any way it
won't. They have too much money and too many amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic improved their team with the selection of versatile
forward Mike Miller of Florida with the fifth pick. True, they had
hoped to get the dynamic Darius Miles, but that plan fell through
when he went to the Clippers at No. 3. Miller may not be ready in
Rick Pitino's eyes, but most everyone else thinks he can play. (And
the Celtics would have taken him in a heartbeat at No. 11.)
</P>
<P>
   But Orlando still had two more picks. It exercised neither of
them. The 10th pick went to the Clippers along with cash, Corey
Maggette, and Derek Strong. In return, the Clippers sent a No. 1
pick, which, of course, means Future Lottery. The 13th pick went to
Dallas for another No. 1 (which, given Dallas's history, could also
be a lottery pick) and $3 million of Mark Cuban's pocket change.
(Some of that may have been routed to the Clippers.)
</P>
<P>
   What does this all mean? It means trouble for everyone else in
the Eastern Conference. Orlando cleared more than $4 million in
salaries _ Strong himself had three years and $11 million _ which
only enhances its already enviable position as free agency
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic now are in a position to spend more than $18 million
on the likes of Tim Duncan, Tracy McGrady, Eddie Jones, Grant Hill,
Maurice Taylor, or any other free agent they might ogle. Their game
plan was to get rid of at least one of their picks and maybe two.
But to do so while also jettisoning two salaries and getting two
No. 1s puts general manager John Gabriel in the Tiger Woods/Pebble
Beach category.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the Celtics' idiotic attempt to acquire
Jermaine O'Neal for three (3!) No. 1s and, well, that is why
Duncan, Hill, McGrady et al will be visiting Central Florida
starting Saturday. That's when the courtship legally can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts cannot be signed until Aug. 1, but there's no such
deadline on public intentions.
</P>
<P>
   While the Magic were cleaning up, the Chicago Bulls, the other
team with picks and cap room, did some strange things. Like
Orlando, the Bulls wanted Miles, but were unable to get him. But
they then picked Marcus Fizer, which puzzled everyone since they
already have Elton Brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand what the Bulls are doing with Marcus
Fizer,'' Charles Barkley said on TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Bulls drafted the Consensus Best Center in Chris Mihm,
which was a logical move considering they have no center. But they
then traded him to division rival Cleveland for a point guard,
Jamal Crawford, who was the hottest of the hot in the eyes of
draftniks over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's resume: 17 games for Michigan. That's it. But he's
still an improvement over what Chicago had. Chicago GM Jerry Krause
still left ample room for small forwards (McGrady, Tim Thomas) who
might come his way during free agency. The Bulls still have a
considerable stash, but the Magic trumped them.
</P>
<P>
   We would like to think that the Clippers made out well, too.
But, well, they are the Clippers, which means, of course, that
they'll find a way to screw it all up. They picked up Maggette,
Strong, Keyon Dooling, Miles, and Quentin Richardson, as well as
cash.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good night for most teams. But the Clippers have a way
of turning gold into dross, as Barkley noted.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the Clippers' selection of the 18-year-old Miles,
Barkley said, ``I don't think this is a good fit. The Clippers are
a terrible organization. I hope that kid can get out there. There's
no excuse for what the Clippers have been doing for the last 15
years. It's a terrible organization.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right, of course. But that's old news. On the other side of
the country, the Magic were due for one long round of applause. The
real battle has yet to begin, but Orlando has put itself into the
best position to make a big hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic already had plenty going for them. Now, they have even
more.

NEW PLAYER ADDS   TO CHIP SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's no such thing as a computer that's too fast.
Everybody knows that.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite everybody. Indeed, the world's top chip makers
are busily inventing clever new ways to make their processors run
slower. Strolling the corridors of this year's PC Expo trade show,
I encountered several examples of their recent handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   These slower chips are made for portable computers, the kind
powered by hefty slabs of lithium that generally provide only two
to three hours of useful life. That's because it takes so much
energy to drive the colorful flat-panel display screens and the
multigigabyte hard drives, and the DVD drives for watching The
Matrix on that coast-to-coast flight. They all eat electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the worst gluttons is the processor itself. Today's
high frequency processors want lots of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it is wasted as raw heat. Desktop computers use fans and
metal heatsinks to disperse the heat; use a laptop and your thighs
become the heatsink. Even the lower-powered laptop processors made
by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. don't completely
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But they're trying harder, with new chip designs that dial back
on the processor's power consumption whenever possible. When you're
playing a game or a video, the chip goes to full power; punch up a
boring text document, and it drops back into cruising speed.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a new idea, but it's taken on new urgency for AMD and
Intel, thanks to the most heavily-touted chip start-up in years,
Transmeta. That's the Silicon Valley company that got international
headlines by hiring the world's most famous programmer, Linux
creator Linus Torvalds.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta wasn't working on Linux software, though. It was
designing a new chip called Crusoe that's designed to run
Intel-compatible software while using just a fraction of the power
consumed by Intel chips.
</P>
<P>
   The first Crusoe-based computers are on display here, and at
first glance, Intel and AMD have reason to be concerned. The
prototype machines, from IBM Corp. and NEC Corp., are ultralight
laptops that seemed to offer solid performance during my brief
tinkering session.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta folk proudly pointed to an on-screen gauge that shows
the processor leaping to its full speed of 533 megahertz when I
started up a video player, then dropping down to 333 megahertz once
the video is running. The result, they say, is a minilaptop that'll
run for eight to 10 hours before it needs a recharge.
</P>
<P>
   AMD has responded to the challenge with a system that does
pretty much the same thing. Its mobile PowerNow chips constantly
speed up and slow down depending on the user's actions. AMD says
PowerNow will make the battery in a full-sized laptop last about an
hour longer.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Intel is offering a system called SpeedStep that
automatically slows down its mobile Pentium III chips when a laptop
is running on battery power. There's also QuickStart, a feature
that makes the chip run flat-out when the user is doing something _
typing, for instance. But the chip drops instantly into a
power-thrifty ``idle'' mode when you pause for a second or two.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta chief executive David Ditzel says he doesn't much mind
that rival companies are copying his company's slowdown strategy.
``Even at peak performance, we still dissipate a lot less power,''
Ditzel declares.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of another Transmeta design trick. Instead of
building Intel-compatibility commands into the chip, Crusoe stores
them in software, and runs them only when needed. That means Crusoe
chips need fewer transistors, and thus less power. They're also
smaller than a Pentium or AMD K6, and they run a lot cooler. The
base of the Crusoe laptop I tested was barely above room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out later this year whether consumers will embrace
Crusoe-based machines. But the company has already inspired a
rethinking of the megahertz megalomania that's driven the industry
for so many years. Of course, it would have happened anyway; as
millions of us buy palm computers and Internet cell phones, battery
endurance starts to matter more than raw horsepower. That's why so
many chips now feature power brakes as standard equipment.

   &QL;  Fees for using national forests likely to continue
</P>
<P>
   By Jen Miller
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 28 -- Despite widespread public opposition, the
federal government is likely to continue charging fees to visit
national forests.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after legislation was introduced to end the
controversial fees, Congress has yet to vote on the measure.
Proponents of the fee charge say getting rid of it would harm the
timber industry, which relies on national forests for five percent
of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lois Capps, D-Ca., introduced legislation last June in part
because of public backlash to the fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't need to pay five dollars to watch a sunset or
hike a trail,'' said Capps spokesperson, Stacie Paxton. ``The fee
is a form of double taxation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill has stalled in Congress because of worries of its
effect on the powerful timber industry. The legislation was
referred last June to the House Agricultural Committee, where it
has languished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fee money is used for mapping roads and preparing to
harvest timbers,'' said Luci Willits, spokesperson for Rep. Mike
Simpson, R-Blackfoot. ``We want to continue the experiment to give
local forest managers time to see if the program works for them _
There are other ways to end the fee program without hurting the
timber industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began charging fees at national forests
in 1997, aiming to improve national forests and increase timber
production. Originally slated to end this year, the program has
been extended until 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the fee program is the Sawtooth National Recreation
Area. The park, which was once free to visitors, now charges five
dollars for a daily pass for park use or fifteen dollars for a
yearly pass.
</P>
<P>
   Since the program began in 1997, more than $260,000 has been
collected. This money has been used to improve recreation
facilities in Sawtooth and to add bathrooms and pave trails.
</P>
<P>
   Will Caldwell, co-founder of the Idaho Sporting Congress, said
he opposes the entry charge because he thinks it commercializes the
forest. ``[The government's] plan is to create major development:
new marinas, new hotels, new stores, new motorized vehicle trails _
They are going into business to create a theme-park atmosphere in
the national forest.''

LABOR OPPOSES NIEMAN CONTENDER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Harvard University mulls a final decision on a new Nieman
Foundation curator, a heated lobbying campaign has been launched
against one of the reported leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In strongly worded letters to Harvard president Neil Rudenstine,
Metropolitan Detroit AFL-CIO president Donald W. Boggs and
Newspaper Guild president Linda Foley ask him to reject Freedom
Forum senior vice president Robert Giles for the prestigious Nieman
post.
</P>
<P>
   The source of their concern is Giles's former stint as publisher
and editor of The Detroit News and his role in Detroit's
still-festering newspaper labor dispute. According to Newspaper
Guild of Detroit president Lou Mleczko, there are still 600 union
workers who have not returned to their jobs five years after the
bitter strike began.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs's June 19 letter to Harvard accuses Giles of having been
``the symbol of a crippling labor dispute that has continued to
tear apart our community,'' and charges that he oversaw slanted
News coverage of the strike. ``Guild journalists across the country
. . . would see an appointment of Mr. Giles as a deep betrayal by
an institution they revere,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In her June 22 letter, Foley alleges that Giles ``condoned the
firing and replacement of some of the country's finest
journalists,'' during the early days of the strike and ``showed
himself to be committed, not to high journalistic standards, but
instead to the corporate agenda of the Gannett Co.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Mleczko said that ``our office has
not heard anything from Harvard,'' in response to the letters.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard officials declined to comment on the letters Wednesday.
And Giles did not return phone calls.

<P>
   A few weeks ago, a study by the Pew Research Center revealed
that the Internet boom was significantly eroding the audience for
broadcast television news. Now, a new study released by the
National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia University
suggests that the Internet boom has significantly eroded the
coverage that broadcast television devotes to arts and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The survey _ of roughly 5,800 minutes of nightly network news
footage from 1990 to '99 _ found that a decade ago, more than 80
percent of coverage in the broad ``media'' category dealt with arts
and culture. But then cyberspace began dominating the headlines and
by 1999, arts and culture represented less than half of all network
``media'' coverage as the media business became a hotter story than
artistic media content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media is elbowing out arts,'' says network news analyst Andrew
Tyndall, who helped produce the NAJP study. The Internet is
``obviously the story of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the five top arts and culture stories of the
'90s _ measured in minutes of coverage _ have very little to do
with creativity and almost everything to do with our baser
impulses. The biggest story was television sex and violence (184
minutes), followed by the Academy Awards (140 minutes), Michael
Jackson's sex life (74 minutes), rebellious gangsta rap lyrics
(64), and Frank Sinatra's obituary (62 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   ``The arts aren't inherently newsworthy,'' sighs Tyndall.
``Stories that are important for the arts aren't important for
journalists, and this proves it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Speaking Monday to secondary school educators attending a Media
&AMP; American Democracy Conference sponsored by the Harvard School of
Graduate Education, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry _ an
oft-mentioned name in the Al Gore veepstakes _ took on the role of
media critic. He lamented the lowering of journalistic standards.
(``All of us in politics are dying to meet the person called
`source,' '' he joked.) And he blamed the blurring of news and
entertainment on competitive pressures ``driven by the bean
counters in the back office.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator also expressed the hope that a major media oulet
would rekindle a news renaissance _ and attract a big audience _ by
announcing its intention to eschew more sensationalistic coverage
for solid, substantiated reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of those things like `Field of Dreams,' ''
Kerry said. ``Build it and they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One footnote to the Thomson Newspaper Co.'s decision to sell its
newspaper holdings is the fate of its intriguing experiment to
train regular citizens to become community reporters. The first
class of 15 midcareer hopefuls (average age 34) _ which included a
professional clown, a pizza delivery person and a minister _
finished a 16-week training program in late 1999 and took jobs at
Thomson papers. (Another $700,000 had been budgeted to train a
second class, but the divestiture plans intervened.)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Thomson vice president and editorial director Jim
Jennings says the program is a solid success. What separated the
trainees ``from the 20-somethings that come out of `J-school' is
they were . . . a little bit broader in perspective,'' he says.
``They tend to write a lot less institutional material and a lot
more relevant material.''
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, 14 of the 15 initial graduates are still at
their jobs. The only exception was a staffer who left the Bucyrus
(Ohio) Telegraph-Forum because of her husband's job relocation _
but not before winning an award as best feature writer at a small
Thomson paper.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) - In reaffirming a woman's right to an

acknowledged that the subject evokes ``virtually irreconcilable
points of view.'' He said the Constitution must govern such a
divided society in light of fundamental individual liberties. The
minority, however, was having none of that. The enraged justices
hurled personal insults at the majority. Their fury exposed the
fact that the case was really all about the politics of abortion,
not medical practices or even the law. By MARIANNE MEANS.

</P>
<P>
   If you'd asked me after Monday's decision in Dickerson vs.
United States, I'd have said the Rehnquist Court was trying to
vaporize itself.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Francis Fukuyama predicted the End of History in the
early '90s, and John Frieda announced the End of the Frizzies
shortly thereafter, it looked like the court's decision to uphold
the constitutionality of Miranda warnings signaled the End of
Judicial Review.
</P>
<P>
   How else to interpret the perplexing 7-2 Rehnquist opinion
finding both Congress and the court itself powerless to overturn
court precedent?
</P>
<P>
   If the Dickerson view were correct, Plessy vs. Ferguson would
still be good law. And the court's task would appear to be
finishing up the last legal decisions ever _ putting the final
creamy cornices on the edifice of American Law _ while adhering
blindly to the principle of stare decisis _ that precedent is
irrevocable, even where wrongly decided.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's closing session of the 1999 term suggests that
the End of Ideology is not upon us. Ideology, specifically
religious ideology, is not just alive in the Supreme Court, but
kicking. It's pounding its fists and wailing. It wants its mother.
Or more correctly, its founding father.
</P>
<P>
   And what the cave-painters will fail to capture about
Wednesday's session is the palpable disgust and fury on the part of
Justices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy as they watch their so-called
``moderate'' court spin out of their control.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare for a justice to read aloud from a dissent. It's
deemed fractious. That three justices read lengthy ones Wednesday
morning is quite extraordinary. But that Scalia sounds near tears
while Kennedy goes all red and quavery is inconceivable.
</P>
<P>
   As the justices announce their 10-minute dissents in Stenberg
vs. Carharts _ the partial-birth abortion case _ and Hill vs.
Colorado _ the abortion protest case _ the bench is shooting white
sparks. None of the four so-called ``liberal'' justices read from
their dissents, although Stevens' dissent in Boy Scouts vs. Dale,
in which the court bounced the gay troop leader from the Boy Scout
jamboree, is a scorcher.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, Ginsburg, Souter and Stevens sat quietly on the bench,
mostly gazing at their hands as their brethren castigated them for
being ``indefensible, illogical, and illegitimate'' (Thomas); for
``stacking the deck'' in favor of ``aggressively pro-abortion
novelties'' (Scalia); and for ``abdication of our responsibility''
(Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the Blinking Four weathered the vitriol, their silence
seemed to shout: ``Yo! There are only four of us. And we still have
the majority. How did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to the Moderate Rehnquist Court this year? In
many ways they remain conservative. Woe may still betide any
Congress attempting to regulate non-economic, non-interstate
activity under the Commerce Clause. The Violence Against Women Act
was invalidated in Brzonkala vs. Morrison, despite voluminous
congressional findings that rape affects interstate commerce. FDA
efforts to regulate smoking fared no better _ they were struck down
as shameless congressional overreaching in FDA vs. Brown &AMP;
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   But, to paraphrase one of my favorite Washington ``It'' Boys _
former acting Solicitor General Walter Dellinger _ before you mist
up over the court's sweet deference to states' rights, you may want
to reflect on the possibility that this court doesn't love the
states. It just hates Congress more.
</P>
<P>
   All the cinnamon-scented rhetoric about federalism and state
autonomy evaporated pretty quickly when the autonomous citizens of
Massachusetts tried to set their own foreign policy toward Burma in
Natsios vs. National Foreign Trade Council, or when the state of
Nebraska voted 99-1 in favor of banning partial-birth abortion as
they did in Stenberg vs. Carhart. Or when all 50 states tried to
provide for grandparental visitation. The states morph from
autonomous agents of democracy to backward boneheads pretty
readily.
</P>
<P>
   So, if this court isn't just zealously protecting the states
from federal overreaching, what has it been up to this term? Well,
states can't act as a meta-Congress as they did in Natsios. And
Congress cannot micromanage states as they did in Brzonkala. And
Congress can't act as meta-court, as it did with Miranda in
Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   The both-ends-against-the-middle game ensures that the states
and Congress are limited to saying ``thank you'' while the court,
as it's done since Marbury vs. Madison, plays meta-Medici and
hoards the most rocking power of all: the power to allocate power.
And if the holding in Dickerson amounts to nothing more than a
chest-thumping chief justice insisting that Nobody gets to
emasculate his court other than, well, his court, at least he's
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do with Wednesday's abortion decisions? The holding
in Stenberg is more far-reaching than anything foreshadowed at oral
argument. The court could have gone gutless and limited itself to
finding the Nebraska abortion overbroad, as it sweeps common
dilation and extractions (D&AMP;Es) under its ban on D&AMP;Xs (intact
dilation and extraction).
</P>
<P>
   As it did in Troxel (the grandparents' rights case), the court
could have limited itself to invalidating the badly drafted
Nebraska statute and left the big question about whether D&AMP;Xs are
constitutionally protected for another day. But the five-justice
majority, led by Breyer, boldly went today where no court has gone
and found that their 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood vs. Casey
requires statutes limiting abortion to include an exception for the
health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Nebraska statute provides an exception to the
partial-birth ban only where the life of the mother is at risk, the
majority invalidated the ban as creating an ``undue burden'' on a
woman's right to choose. Since an exception based on a woman's
health would leave each and every D&AMP;X decision to the abortion
doctor's discretion, the health exception would swallow the rule _
which is why neither the Nebraska statute nor the two congressional
attempts to ban partial-birth abortion contain health-of-the-mother
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Thomas' dissent, read in his great sonorous voice, warns
that Wednesday's holding will eviscerate all the other 29 states'
partial-birth abortion bans, as well as the democratic processes
that led to them. And on the courthouse steps Wednesday afternoon,
pro-life spokesmen promise that Al Gore will lose the election on
this issue alone. A statement handed to me by a lackey for House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay trashes the ``activist Judiciary'' for
their ``contrived legal theories'' of which he was unaware when
this statement was prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the really high-octane tantrums come in response
to Hill vs. Colorado, the Colorado ``bubble'' case. Certainly both
Scalia and Kennedy use their dissents in Hill to complain about the
outcome in Stenberg. A surprising 6-3 majority _ including the new,
``If Ya Can't Beat 'Em, Join 'Em'' Rehnquist, uphold the
constitutionality of Colorado's 8-foot bubble of privacy
proscribing unwanted speech outside a health facility.
</P>
<P>
   Delivering the opinion of the court, Justice Stevens invents an
astonishing new right _ the right to ``be let alone.'' For this
proposition he cites a Brandeis dissent in a 1928 case. Now I
confess that the unsolicited AT&AMP;T calls are starting to get to me.
But the notion that the right to be free from harassment is not
only constitutional but somehow outweighs the right to free speech
(you know _ the one enshrined in the First Amendment) is
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Scalia is anything but breathless as he blisters the
majority for upholding an overbroad, content-based, viewpoint-based
statute simply because it prohibits speech with which they
disagree. He blasts them for creating a prophylactic, bright-line
rule. (Breyer starts giggling here and I can't help but wonder if
he's thinking that if there had only been prophylactics in play, we
wouldn't be protesting at abortion clinics in the first place.)
</P>
<P>
   Scalia goes on for over 10 minutes, listing the religious and
moral imperatives driving sidewalk counselors outside clinics he
calls the ``forum of last resort.'' He lets us in on how he feels
about Stenberg by describing abortion in terms of a ``live and
kicking child, part way out of the womb.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of alive and kicking, Justice Kennedy's dissent from
Hill literally puts me in fear for his heart. It is broken, and his
regret appears to be over nothing so much as his deciding vote in
Casey. Having voted in a 5-4 bloc to preserve a woman's right to
choose, he stops shy of disavowing his position but accuses the
court of ``turning its back'' on the careful moral balance for
which he had voted in Casey. He closes with disgust at the court's
denial of pro-life pamphleteers having the ``opportunity to offer a
fellow citizen ... a handheld paper seeking to reach a higher
law.''
</P>
<P>
   A higher law? Kennedy joins the dissenters in Stenberg,
suggesting that his own regret may well be his failure to ban
abortion altogether back in 1992 when he had the chance.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion in Boy Scouts vs. Dale, a 5-4 decision announced by
Rehnquist, is like the Hill decision about abortion protesters in
that it balances known rights against blurry rights and lets the
blurry rights prevail. In Hill, the ``right'' to be let alone
trumps the right to speak. In Dale, the right to ``expressive
association'' trumps the right to be free from discrimination in
public accommodations. The decision in Mitchell vs. Helms allows
taxpayers to put computers into Catholic schools without running
afoul of the Establishment Clause.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the above last week's decision in Santa Fe vs. Doe _ the
case prohibiting student prayer before football games _ and the
picture is complete. The Rehnquist Court of the 1999 term stands
for states' rights, preserving its own power, and religious
hysteria in every shape and form.
</P>
<P>
   Was it me who once said, ``Religion is the race of the
millennium''? I doubt it. But Jonathan Swift could have been
talking of this court when he said, ``We have just enough religion
to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Have a nice summer, court fans. I'm off to Colorado to get
fitted for my bubble.

&HT;     OAKLAND'S GROWTH PUTS CRIMP ON AGENCIES FOR POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MATTHEW YI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ It is a familiar tune that has already been
heard elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area: corporate wealth,
fueled by the dot-coms, is pushing out nonprofit organizations that
serve the poor.
</P>
<P>
   What has been happening in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley
is now occurring in Oakland, a city that has been slower to attract
the economic growth than the rest of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we don't want development,'' said James Thomas,
executive director of the Emergency Services Network of Alameda
County, ``it's that we don't want displacement.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old nonprofit organization that Thomas runs
coordinates service agencies in the East Bay. He led a group of
about 50 pickets outside Jerry Brown's home near Jack London Square
on Wednesday, asking the Oakland mayor to pay attention to their
plight.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is seeking policies to protect agencies serving the poor
and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   He has two ideas:
</P>
<P>
   One would require landlords to give at least a year's notice
before raising rents. Typically, the agencies are on month-to-month
leases with no way to pay higher rent right away since their
budgets are fixed annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second would either require commercial developments to
include space for nonprofit agencies, or have developers pay into a
trust fund, which will be used by the service providers to help pay
their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown acknowledged that it is a thorny problem, but one that
needs to be addressed more by the county, not the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key point is that social services are the function of the
county. We have serious responsibilities in police, fire, parks and
things like that. We have to be very careful that we don't
short-change our primary responsibilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also pointed out that new development in Oakland is
relatively recent phenomena, so there are not great numbers of
builders or developers who would be willing to help subsidize the
nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the city wanted to pitch in, it does not have the luxury
of significant budget surpluses like San Francisco and San Jose
have, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work with (the agencies), but we don't have a bank with
unlimited funding. . . . We're in a very tight squeeze here,'' said
Brown, a former Democratic governor of California.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, downtown was more ghost town than vibrant
business center. Landlords scrambled to find tenants, and office
space was given to nonprofit agencies for as little as 60 cents per
square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are over.
</P>
<P>
   With the space crunch in San Francisco and the Silicon Valley,
more companies have been moving to Oakland, encouraging landlords
to fix up their units and rent them out at much higher prices: Some
increased by more than $3 per square foot.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy rate in downtown Oakland has plummeted in recent
years, falling from 13 percent at the end of 1996 to a little over
2 percent now, according to the city's Community and Economic
Development Agency.

&HT;     SAN FRANCISCO REPORTERS FACE QUESTIONS AS PART OF PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lawyers hired by the Hearst Corp. have started
closed-door questioning of San Francisco Examiner reporters in an
investigation into suspended Publisher Timothy O. White's testimony
that he offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorials in exchange
for support of Hearst's purchase of the rival San Francisco
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys assigned by Charles B. Renfrew, the retired federal
judge appointed by Hearst on May 10 to head the probe, conducted at
least three interviews Wednesday, starting with reporters who
covered Brown and his re-election last year. They plan to talk to
other reporters, editors, White and Hearst executives, said Sanford
Kingsley, a lawyer conducting the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to move as quickly as we can,'' said Kingsley, a
litigator at the San Francisco firm of LeBoeuf Lamb Greene &AMP;
MacRae, where Renfrew was formerly a partner. ``We don't have a
strict timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, which was to have been the deadline for completion
of the Chronicle purchase, Hearst announced an extension to Aug. 31
to allow time for developments in federal court. A ruling is still
pending on an antitrust suit by Clint Reilly, a former mayoral
candidate and unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner, who contends
acquisition of the Chronicle would give Hearst an illegal monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley declined to discuss the scope of the investigation or
say how many Examiner employees would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   The legal team, advised by a journalistic expert whose name has
not been announced, has spent weeks reviewing documents and is also
inspecting Examiner computer files, said James M. Asher, senior
vice president and legal and development officer at the Hearst
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hearst wants the investigation to remain confidential at
this stage, and has asked employees not to discuss the sessions
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   But knowledgeable sources said the questioning covered such
topics as whether articles about Brown were slanted at the
suggestion of White or other editors; whether stories were delayed
for questionable reasons, and whether the Examiner's coverage
changed after its editorial endorsement of Brown for re-election in
November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There was also general questioning about how stories were
assigned and edited, but no questions that suggested the
investigation was focusing on a particular story, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   White, a veteran Hearst executive who had served as editor and
publisher of the Examiner since January 1999, testified May 1 that
he met Brown for lunch last August and offered editorial page
support in exchange for the mayor's backing of Hearst's $660
million purchase of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony, in a federal court trial of an antitrust suit
challenging the sale, was denounced by staff members of both
newspapers, denied by Examiner officials and the mayor, and
repudiated by White himself in a statement released by Hearst
officials, which said he had been ``tired and confused by the
question.'' However, it turned out he had given similar testimony
to Justice Department investigators in a deposition in December
1999.
</P>
<P>
   White was placed on administrative leave May 2 and replaced as
publisher on an interim basis by George B. Irish, president of
Hearst Newspapers. Renfrew, who served on the federal bench from
1972 to 1980 before returning to law practice, was named by Hearst
on May 10 to conduct what he described as an ``open, independent
and unlimited review'' of White's testimony and the Examiner's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle sale, and Hearst's transfer of the Examiner to
local publisher Ted Fang along with a $66 million subsidy, are
being challenged in Reilly's antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The trial ended May 31, but U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker is
delaying a ruling while he awaits a Justice Department reply, due
Thursday, to his invitation to enter the case or file papers
explaining its views. The department's Antitrust Division approved
the Chronicle purchase in March, but Walker wants to know whether
trial testimony about the sale process and the newspapers' value
might have changed the government's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Renfrew's investigation is unrelated to the legal issues and is
instead addressed to the newspaper's reputation, which took a
public battering with White's testimony.

</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asher, Hearst's chief legal officer, said employees are being
asked to cooperate with the investigation and to keep the questions
and answers confidential so that Hearst remains free to decide
whether to make the results public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be able to preserve confidentiality of this
effort if individual employees are making public disclosures about
it that could be harmful,'' Asher said.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Editor Phil Bronstein said he also favored a
confidential investigation but added that staffers who choose to
speak publicly should not fear punishment. Bronstein, who attended
White's luncheon with Brown and has said he heard no offer of
favorable treatment, is arranging staff interviews with the
investigators and is awaiting his own interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains that the editorial integrity of the Examiner
was not compromised,'' he said.

&HT;     MAKING A BETTER-TASTING SLAW FOR THE HOLIDAY PICNIC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARYELLEN DRISCOLL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a name that sounds like an Eastern European folk dance
and a tight affiliation with picnics and cookouts for a salad of
shredded raw cabbage to wedge its way into a summer menu.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if there is any fault with coleslaw, fingers must point to
all too often a heavy ladling of mayonnaise or a lack of discretion
with the vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is most readily identified by the gag test. Take a
bite. If your throat constricts and a spastic cough follows, you've
too fallen victim to overly acidic coleslaw. One of the surest ways
to avoid this is by switching to a mildly acidic vinegar, such as
rice-wine vinegar. As for the mayonnaise, it just takes restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a vast life beyond traditional coleslaw,
which comes from the Dutch word koolsla, meaning ``cool cabbage.''
Cabbage mates nicely with a wide combination of summer flavors to
give you a smorgasbord of ``cool cabbage'' salads to choose from on
July 4.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a food processor, shredding cabbage can take just
seconds. Cut the cabbage into wedges and feed through the mouth of
the food processor using the slicing disk attachment. For visual
variety, any of the recipes can be made with a combination of red
and green cabbage. If making a day in advance of serving, taste the
salad before serving. Its bright, gentle bite tends to dull with
time. So you might need to add an additional 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of
rice-wine vinegar or corresponding acid.

   _ From a 1996 rant by Comedian Dennis Miller, hired last week by
ABC-TV's ``Monday Night Football''
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4, 2000. The St. Louis Rams host the Denver Broncos in the
regular-season opener of ``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   AL MICHAELS: ``Welcome back to `Monday Night Football'
everybody, where the Denver Broncos are leading the St. Louis Rams
21-17 with one minute remaining in the game and the Rams taking
over on their own 14-yard-line, first and 10.''
</P>
<P>
   DAN FOUTS: ``That's a long way to go with only one timeout
remaining, but if anyone can do it, Kurt Warner is the man. He's a
can-do guy.''
</P>
<P>
   DENNIS MILLER: ``Did you just use the phrase can-do? Wow,
cha-cha, you're really cutting edge there! Let me do my Bette Davis
and fasten my ------- seatbelt so I can keep up with the lingo,
Fouts-meister.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``Warner drops back, he's looking over the middle but
now he just has to throw the ball away to avoid the sack as Nathan
Davis sends him sprawling. Not only was there a strong rush by
Davis, but the pass coverage by the Denver secondary was once again
impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUTS: ``All night long, the Broncos have conceded the run and
have forced Kurt Warner to throw into deep zone coverage, and he
hasn't been able to make the necessary adjustments, and that's
coming back to haunt him now.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: ``I'll tell you what's haunting me, it's that beard Hank
Williams Jr. wears in the opening montage. Is he Amish now or
something? Memo to Hank: The 21st century stopped by and would like
you to return its call, babe. And if that's ------- country music
then I'm a Denver Broncos cheerleader _ and you don't see me in
midriff-baring outfits and high-heeled boots, unless you're
attending the Annual Miller Family Reunion and I've had a few too
many mimosas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country music is more doomed than a Texas inmate awaiting a
mercy call from George W. Bush. Now I don't want to get off on a
rant here, but to me country music is Johnny Cash singing about
doing hard time or George Jones singing a love song in between SUV
wrecks and chugs of Jack Daniels _ it's not some doofus named
Bosephus doing an ersatz Daddy thing while a bunch of Carmen
Electra-looking cheerleaders jump around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, real country music scares the ---- out of radio
executives, who are nothing but Florsheim salesmen with better
haircuts. Faith Hill and Shania Twain aren't country singers,
they're midriff-baring masturbatory fantasies who look like the
daughters of one of the Golddiggers on the old `Dean Martin Show,'
babe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``By the way, Kurt Warner was injured on that last
play, it appears he twisted his ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   FOUTS: ``Take a look at the replay and you can see where Warner
just got tangled up in his own feet as Davis came in.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``So now here comes Trent Green, once considered to be
the future of this franchise before he was injured and Warner came
out of nowhere to have that magical season last year.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: ``Here's what gets me. Everyone on the Rams now accepts
Green as the quarterback; they just forget about the other guy! It
reminds me of when the second Darrin showed up on `Bewitched' and
he started nailing Sammy and bantering with Endora, and nobody
said, `Hey, you can't fool a bunch of witches, what the ---- did
you do with the other Darrin?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't want to get off on a rant here, but the substitute
is never as good as the real thing, whether we're talking about
Parkay masquerading as butter or George Lazenby trying to fill
Connery's tux as Bond or Peter Bogdanovich marrying Dorothy
Stratten's little sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   MICHAELS: ``You might notice on your television set that the
entire Rams team is jumping around in the end zone. That's because
Trent Green just connected with Isaac Bruce on a 98-yard touchdown
pass with no time remaining, in one of the most astounding finishes
ever. Do you believe in miracles?''
</P>
<P>
   MILLER: ``Sure, I believe in miracles, because there's no other
way to explain why Matt LeBlanc makes more money blowing his nose
between takes on `Friends' than the entire Royal Shakespeare
Company earns in a good decade, cha-cha. Now I don't want to get
off on a rant here ...''
</P>
<P>
   FOUTS: ``Anybody got Rush Limbaugh's number?''

&HT;     WHEN TOO MUCH PRIDE CAN SLAM THE DOORS ON SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A recent television special on the musical
highlights from ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' had a great workplace
anecdote about what happened when two egos collided: those of
Sullivan and Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors.
</P>
<P>
   Their clash happened in 1967, but the same principles of
arrogance and stubbornness are present today. And they are just as
self-destructive as they have always been.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what happened: The Doors were scheduled to perform their
huge hit, ``Light My Fire,'' on Sullivan's show. Because of
concerns that the song promoted drug use, the censors asked
Morrison to change one line _ ``Girl, we couldn't get much higher''
_ to something else, apparently, ``Girl, we couldn't get much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison agreed. But then he sung the song his way.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan was furious. The Doors were never invited back to his
show.
</P>
<P>
   Now certainly their clash didn't destroy either career, but it
kept both men from being as successful as they could be. Sullivan
prided himself on attracting top musical talent, and it hurt his
show not to have The Doors on more than once. On the other hand, in
an era before the Internet or MTV, Sullivan's show was an
entertainer's best form of exposure, so the ban had to hurt The
Doors as well.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Morrison was wrong. He went back on his word,
sacrificing his credibility for the sake of one word in a lyric.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it wasn't as if network censorship was all that
unusual. Sullivan's show one time telecast Elvis Presley only from
the waist up because of his swiveling hips, and had the Rolling
Stones change their song ``Let's Spend the Night Together'' to
``Let's Spend Some Time Together.''
</P>
<P>
   (Those examples might sound ridiculous today, but censorship in
some form will always exist. I don't think you will hear Regis
Philbin asking, ``What's the street value of a kilo of cocaine in
New York City?'' anytime soon. Do you?)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sullivan and the censors were also wrong.
Although ``Let's Spend Some Time Together'' might make you cringe,
at least it doesn't sound like it was written by someone with a tin
ear. But the change in ``Light My Fire'' would have been horrible.
</P>
<P>
   The last word of the line needs to rhyme with ``liar'' and
``fire''; higher does, but better doesn't. It also needs to pass
for a single-syllable word; higher can, better can't. The
songwriter would have sounded like a hack.
</P>
<P>
   What happened between Sullivan and Morrison is the same sort of
thing that can happen between talented bosses and talented
employees. Both have achieved so much success that they are
determined to see things their way, without pausing to consider the
other person's point of view or whether there would be an
acceptable compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming for a minute that both men were coherent at the time of
their dispute, Morrison should have known that singing ``higher''
would embarrass Sullivan, and Sullivan should have known that
changing the word would embarrass Morrison. Yet apparently neither
managed to suggest that it would be better if The Doors simply
performed another song, or if the show just bleeped that word.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask co-workers to make a crucial concession, think
about whether your gain is worth their sacrifice. Is there a
compromise that would allow both of you to win? Just because you
have the firepower to win a war doesn't mean you should start one.
</P>
<P>
   It is wonderful to have pride in your work, but you need to
appreciate that others have pride in their work, too. If you try to
take that away from them, you will never be able to break on
through to the other side.
</P>

 &HT;     By LYSSA FRIEDMAN

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mattel Inc. has secured the right to market toys
based on the hot-selling Harry Potter children's books. The fourth
title about the British wizard is scheduled for release July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Author J.K. Rowling's stories have shattered sales records at
Scholastic Press Inc. They have been translated into 28 languages.
Warner Bros. bought the film rights for a sum well into the seven
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter dominates the youth market, but adults love him,
too. The debut volume, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,''
topped the New York Times bestseller list for well over a year.
``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' and ``Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban'' occupied the first and second slots for
months. All three remain among the nation's top eleven hardcover
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only a matter of time before a toy manufacturer cashed
in on the phenomenon. Toys 'R' Us will stock Harry Potter dolls,
games and high-tech toys in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   The books are a fantasy wonderland. Harry's magical parents were
murdered during his infancy by Lord Voldemort, so evil he is known
as ``He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry spent his first 10 years living with his cranky relatives,
the Dursleys, in a nondescript floral British suburb. The Dursleys
are muggles _ mortals without magical skills _ and they keep
Harry's heritage a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Harry's powers are revealed. He leaves for Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There owls, not postal carriers,
deliver mail. On the walls hang paintings whose characters speak
and move about, often into adjacent frames. Harry enrolls in
classes like ``Care of Magical Creatures'' and competes at
Quidditch, an aerial soccer-like game in which players dart around
on broomsticks.
</P>
<P>
   At Hogwarts, Harry meets best mates Ron Weasley, a redhead from
a family of seven wizards, and Hermione Granger, a straight-A
student and the first witch among her relations.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the books so popular?
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's rich parallel world suspends the reader's disbelief
from the first page. A good-versus-evil plot arcs through each
book. But alongside skip adventures and subplots with quick
resolutions that make the stories page-turners. Think Narnia's
magic combined with Star Wars' pacing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the escapades of Harry, Ron and Hermione involve
dragons and poltergeists, the children suffer age-appropriate
growing pains. Bullies attend Hogwarts. Fights erupt. Jealousies
percolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I fit in?'' the witches worry. ``Will I pass the Reading
Tea Leaves test?'' ``Why doesn't she like me?''
</P>
<P>
   The Potter books have earned parental praise by encouraging a
generation of children raised on Nintendo to abandon the joystick
and pick up a book. Even slow readers and children with learning
difficulties can't put the stories down.
</P>
<P>
   Harry engages the imagination. No one has seen a Quidditch game,
but anyone who has read a Potter book can picture it played between
the golden goalposts 50 feet skyward.
</P>
<P>
   But why read about a Quidditch match when you can watch special
effects on a screen? Why fantasize about Harry catching the winged
ball that wins the game when you can switch on the computer and
beat the opposition with a click of the mouse? Why imagine what
Harry's high-speed broomstick looks like when you can unwrap a toy
facsimile on Christmas morning? Batteries not included.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter is a phenomenon because he has encouraged children
to activate their minds. And it is the marketing of Harry Potter _
the Hermione dolls, magic wands and video games _ that will dim the
light that Harry has lighted.
</P>
<P>
   By that I mean the light in the eyes of a child curled up with a
book.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harry and his friends live in a modern world, they
practice ancient divining arts. Their schoolrooms are heated by
fireplaces, the hallways lighted by candle. Harry gave children a
gift: magic and excitement that don't require the flip of a switch
or the bleep of a modem.
</P>
<P>
   So I say we return Harry's gift. Ignore the toys. Keep the
computer screens dark. Stay out of the movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   And head to the library when Harry Potter IV arrives.
</P>

<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ President Dwight Eisenhower was still in
Walter Reed Army Hospital recovering from a heart attack when he
signed the 1956 Federal Aid Highway Act, the largest public works
project in the history of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The fruits of the 44-year-old law have been both sweet _ free
movement of people and commerce over 43,000 mapped, paved and
interconnected miles _ and bitter _ urban sprawl, rush hours and
smog. The interstate highway system stitches the country together:
Virtually everywhere is accessible. At the same time, virtually
everyone is subject to traffic, pollution and road rage.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the interstate (and of government-sponsored
highway expansion in general) offers a valuable insight into the
capacity of the state to solve long-term problems. For highways are
a classic example of how government officials grapple with the
issues of their own generation, sometimes quite successfully. The
catch is that one generation's visionary program may become the
next generation's headache.
</P>
<P>
   Federal interest in road-building began in the late 1800s, in
response to a new invention, not the car, as is widely assumed, but
the bicycle. By the 1890s, bikes were so popular that cycling
looked like a serious alternative to the far more expensive (and
environmentally harsh) railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, outside of big cities, most roads were just dirt,
a complaint of the time described them as ``wholly unclassable,
almost impassable, scarcely jackassable.'' In 1893, a federal
Office of Road Inquiry was set up to research the problem of rural
transit. For the next two decades, this forefather of the
Department of Transportation preached, to whoever would listen, the
gospel of road improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Just how such improvement would be funded was decided in 1916,
when the Bankhead Bill (presented by actress Tallulah Bankhead's
senator-father) established the principle of federal-state
partnerships for the funding of roads _ a principle which, with
various tweakings, still exists today. By then, however, the car,
not the bike, was America's vehicle of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Road building blossomed during the 1920s, as the economy boomed
and the trucking industry convinced Congress of the commercial
benefits of paved highways. The '20s saw, among other things, the
first numbered highways, as well as plans for the Pan-American
Highway (Alaska to Argentina). As in the 1890s, however, the
emphasis remained on rural roads.
</P>
<P>
   During the Depression, rural road improvement, seen as a
job-source for the unemployed, continued. In 1938, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed a federally-funded toll-road
system which, unlike most New Deal programs, was supposed to be
profitable enough to actually pay for itself. His transport experts
replied that a national road system was a great idea, but argued
that since most existing roads were free, people would never pay
tolls. Instead they proposed an interstate system of ``Free
Highways'' _ freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Although World War II held up freeway construction, interest in
an interstate system remained. But a serious financial commitment
to such a project remained vague until Eisenhower's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Ike was a major proponent of the interstate. He had been
impressed by Adolf Hitler's autobahns, and believed a national road
system vital for civil defense. His 1956 Federal Aid Highway Act,
which committed both the states and the federal government to the
National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, moved the focus
from rural roads to all roads.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, costs skyrocketed (Reader's Digest, in 1960,
called the Federal Highway Program a ``rat hole'') and
dissatisfaction set in, with many Americans complaining about both
the social and environmental impacts of highways. Yet highway
construction pushed on; soon the gas tax became permanent, and the
entire look of the nation started to change.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping malls ``just off the interstate'' began to appear.
Workers began to commute by car, instead of by train, and distance
became something any American with a full tank of gas could easily
conquer. Suburbs and commerce flourished, while many urban areas
were left behind, and the skies over Los Angeles and other large
cities turned brown.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Interstate Highway System illustrates how
democratically elected governments often operate. Politicians, in
the end, must try to please voters. This means they must respond to
the issues of the day, whether it's cycling (1890s), cars (1910s),
trucks (1920s), unemployment (1930s) or civil defense (1950s).
</P>
<P>
   In all these instances, the future took a back seat to the
present. Government, in the end, is about short-term thinking. In
the long term, it is possible that government may not be the best
agent for solving the greatest problems of a vibrant and changing
nation.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Adios, Elian. Unhappy trails, Boy Scouts. Hello
again, abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has done us all some big favors. The court
rejected appeals by Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives and sent that
over-publicized little boy home _ right, it's his home, as
unbearable as the Leninist landlord is.
</P>
<P>
   Elian go home. It was as satisfying as watching an unworthy
contestant kicked off ``Survivor,'' except in this case, it was
back onto an island.
</P>
<P>
   The court also gave thinking kids another reason not to join the
Boy Scouts, besides having to rub sticks together and wear funny
bandannas. The Boy Scouts always were a weird bunch.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5 to 4 vote, the justices allowed the Scouts to ban gays
from serving as troop leaders, raising the question of whether the
Scouts will be giving out merit badges for finding closets in
tents.
</P>
<P>
   As a gay friend once told me, ``The Boy Scouts was where many of
us found out we were gay.''
</P>
<P>
   In their attempt to interpret their pledge to be ``morally
straight'' according to current vernacular, the Scouts are being
morally dishonest with themselves and everyone else. Does anyone
want to join an organization that purports to uphold the American
way, yet discriminates against a sizable group of Americans?
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts shouldn't be that much like the Army. And neither
should the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the Supremes made two rulings sure to invigorate our
democracy, one overturning a state ban on late-term abortions, and
another giving states more room to restrict demonstrations outside
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions have flushed George W. Bush from his catbird
seat, and forced him to talk about the one issue that could keep
him from being elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Now the amiable, inarticulate W. is appeasing right-wingers
angered by a decision that could negate some 30 states' laws
against late-pregnancy abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``States should have the right to enact reasonable laws and
restrictions, particularly concerning the brutal practice of
partial-birth abortion,'' Bush said on Wednesday. ``Unlike Al Gore,
I pledge to fight for a ban on partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   The right wing invented that phrase for a procedure that is
rarely used, and then generally to save a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   What Al Gore must do is play the women's card, and change the
terms of debate as surely as that phrase ``partial-birth abortion''
did. He has to talk about the right of women to save their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Gore isn't going to beat Bush with energy plans or by talking
about cars that don't run on gasoline. Americans love cars that run
on gasoline, and lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore isn't going to beat Bush by trying to pin high gas prices
on him. Bush is playing the same game, and we know both are running
on empty on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore isn't going to win on gun control or crime issues, or by
displaying his high-mindedness through the uncertain trumpet of his
voice. Watch some Regis and some MTV. This is the decade of the
amiable ignoramus, and Bush is a leader in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Women are going to carry this election. Gore and the Democrats
have to convince women that Bush and the Republicans are willing to
let them die in service of their ideology. Gore has to portray Bush
and the Republicans as goons trying to wrest control of women's
bodies as brazenly as any drunken jerks in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Women know that deep in the male brainpan is an antediluvian ape
telling them that women's bodies are not their own. Most men manage
to ignore the inner ape, but not all.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Gore's army of advisers can make a subtle connection
between rowdies who grope women's private parts, and politicians
who won't even let women have parts that are private.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this connection has to be made more gently than that.
That's the trick, and a tough one for the blaring Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He lost weight and buffed up. He learned to wear earth tones. He
can learn that when you hold a straight flush of women's cards, you
don't have to shout or wave your hand.
</P>
<P>
   He also should learn he has to play it.

&HT;     FOR MOTHER OF THE BRIDE, WEDDING BELLS CAN BE CACOPHONY

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Selecting wedding attire can be stressful, but
Ilene Beckerman's new book finds humor in the situation for at
least one member of the bridal party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother of the Bride: The Dream, the Reality, the Search for a
Perfect Dress'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, $17.95) offers an
offbeat look at putting together a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Beckerman, an author and illustrator who travels the country
imparting funny and sage advice to audiences, has judged People
magazine's Best and Worst Dressed issue and writes frequently on
the Oscars for the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Her wit on mother-of-the-bride dresses comes from having three
married daughters. She also has two unmarried sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, childbirth was easier than being the
mother of the bride,'' quipped Beckerman in a recent phone
interview from her home in Connecticut. ``But I've found that, with
humor, the forgotten woman of the wedding can get through this. As
mother of the bride, don't lose your sense of humor. Remember, you
got through toilet training your daughter, you'll get through
this.''
</P>
<P>
   As mother of the bride, the pressure is also on you and how you
will look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planning a wedding is similar to producing a show at a dinner
theater,'' Beckerman writes in her book. ``Both events have a
script, stars, a supporting cast, a budget that's too small and
critics to please.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckerman found that every bridal fashion show that she went to
featured models who were tall, thin and flat. They all looked like
bread sticks, whereas Beckerman describes her figure as more akin
to a Kaiser roll.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the prospect of finding the right dress, Beckerman
wondered what Jackie O would wear, even though she was built like
an ironing board and Beckerman is shaped more like an upholstered
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, everybody remembers Princess Diana's wedding
dress,'' added Beckerman. ``But who remembers what her mother wore?
It's true the bride is supposed to look the best, but the mother of
the bride doesn't have to wear something that looks like something
that Mrs. Khrushchev would have worn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mother-of-the-bride selections can be dowdy. But, on the other
hand, the mother doesn't want to be in competition with her
daughter or look like one of the attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Rob McNamara, assistant store manager of David's Bridal in
suburban Albany, said that mother-of-the-bride dresses have been
updated with a more youthful look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fabrics are softer,'' McNamara said. ``You are now seeing a
lot of georgette and shear fabric for the jacket and lots of
fashionable colors to choose from. Before, you saw a lot of heavy
beading or satin with beading and the only colors to choose from
were either beige, navy or black.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara added that mothers of the bride are also now selecting
their dresses from the bridesmaids collections for a more youthful
look. Mother-of-the-bride dresses and gowns cost $165 to $300 and
up.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara said that mothers of the bride are also buying informal
wedding gowns in ivory, but without the train, to wear for summer
wedding in a garden or on an island.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what style they choose, they usually try to buy
something with style, so that it can be cut to a tea or cocktail
length for future events.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the wedding calls for cocktail length, be careful how short
you go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of many brides who want their mother to look like
Tina Turner, even if she does have great legs,'' mused Beckerman,
who began her writing career at age 60. ``I remember trying on a
pale pink-and-violet, Monet-inspired chiffon print that Ladybird
Johnson would have loved, but I felt like I looked like a field of
wildflowers.''
</P>
<P>
   A blue sequined gown resembled the aurora borealis, and white
made her look like the Pillsbury Doughboy. Green velvet was the
twin of a pool table. Then Beckerman found a low-cut gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you show a little cleavage, nobody ever looks anywhere
else,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, mother-of-the-bride dresses are a lot more chic than
they were a decade ago. Many of the fashions have a fresh, young
and flattering look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the wedding party, you want to like what you are going to
wear,'' Beckerman said. ``But remember, you are not going to be
presenting an Oscar that night. Just remember that you are `in'
somebody's wedding and not the main event.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to look for a dress, whether you are a bridesmaid
or mother of the bride, is to shop with the bride-to-be, advised
Beckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, pick out a dress or gown that looks good on
you, no matter what the theme of the wedding, and go to the fitting
sessions (even if you don't like your dress). It should look like
it was tailor-made for you.
</P>
<P>
   As for color, always check with the bride before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sole thing to remember when buying your dress is to never
come out looking better than the bride,'' warned Beckerman. ``Yes,
get something flattering, but remember, your main job is to create
a flattering still-life backdrop for the bride's photo album of her
wedding.''

 By DANIEL C. WEAVER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At 4 a.m. on a still-black Monday morning, 76-year-old Robert
Kilgalen came to the emergency room gripping his stomach. His wife
said he'd been alternating between explosive diarrhea and vomiting
for two hours.
 &HT;    He was so dizzy from loss of fluid that he could hardly stand,
and his temperature was 101.5 degrees.
 &HT;    The staff started him on fluids intravenously, then began to
examine him for clues. Toxic chemicals, viruses and pathogenic
bacteria such as shigella, E. coli and salmonella can cause
debilitating diarrhea. But sometimes chronic intestinal
inflammation can provoke it too.
 &HT;    The first step was to examine blood and stool cultures for
infection. The following day, Ellie, the lab technician, came up
from the microbiology lab. She held a small glass vial of stool
culture up to the light. ``Look. There's nothing, not even normal
flora.''
 &HT;    The antibiotics the patient had taken on the way to the hospital
had wiped out any telltale signs. The other lab results indicated
only dehydration and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. We
hadn't a clue what was wrong.
 &HT;    But before long, a feverish 8-year-old girl arrived, sick from
vomiting and diarrhea. Then an 81-year-old woman and a 3-month-old
boy came in with the same symptoms.
 &HT;    Was this the start of an epidemic? None of the new patients had
taken antibiotics, so I hoped one of the cultures would be
positive.
 &HT;    The following morning Ellie showed me the tubes. I could see
that the samples teemed with bacterial colonies. She took small
samples of the fluid and spread it out on agar plates specially
prepared to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and suppress
normal gut flora.
 &HT;    The next morning I went into the lab and Ellie opened the
incubator containing the cultures. She held the agar plate under
the light. There were hundreds of shiny black colonies _
salmonella. All three cultures, she said, were positive.
 &HT;    As many as 4 million salmonella cases break out in the United
States each year, making it the country's most common food
poisoning. More than 2,000 varieties of the bacterium live in the
guts of such animals as pigs, cows and chickens, without causing
them harm. (The infection can also pass from a hen to her eggs.)
 &HT;    One type _ Salmonella typhi _ lives only in humans. It causes
typhoid fever, which can be deadly. While typhoid fever is not
uncommon in countries with poor sewage treatment, it is rare in the
United States.
 &HT;    To thrive in a human, salmonellae must survive the acidic
conditions in the stomach, reach the small intestine and attach to
its lining. If enough live salmonellae get to the intestine,
diarrhea and vomiting _ the host's effort to expel the pathogen _
will follow within six to 48 hours.
 &HT;    In severe cases, the bacteria can slip into the bloodstream and
cause systemic infections. And in rare instances, mostly occurring
in the very young, weak or old, salmonella infection can lead to
death from dehydration or septic shock.
 &HT;    Given the timing of their illnesses, I guessed that all four
patients must have had a common source of infection. I talked with
each patient's doctor and learned that all but the 3-month-old had
recently eaten tapioca at a local restaurant. The 3-month-old,
whose parents were turkey farmers, proved to be infected with a
different type of salmonella.
 &HT;    Next I notified the state board of health. An inspector found
the problem: The restaurant's tapioca cooker wasn't heating the
pudding enough to kill bacteria. Instead it was warming the pudding
just enough to help bacteria grow. In the end, 13 diners at the
restaurant were diagnosed with salmonella food poisoning.
 &HT;    The key to controlling salmonella is understanding its rapid
growth. Bacterial colonies can double every 20 minutes, a rate of
growth so exponential that a single colony bred under perfect
conditions could reach the size of Earth in less than 48 hours.
 &HT;    Salmonellae grow best at about 100 degrees, making the human
body a great host. Keeping food colder than 40 degrees or hotter
than 140 degrees reins in bacterial growth remarkably.
 &HT;    Although restaurant outbreaks make the news, most food
poisonings probably occur at home. I know just how this can happen.
Some 20 years ago, to save money during my residency, I dialed my
refrigerator thermostat up to 45 degrees (my first mistake). Then I
made meat loaf with eggs, failing to cook it long enough (second
mistake), left it overnight on the counter (third mistake), put it
back in the refrigerator (fourth mistake), reheated it in a
microwave oven (fifth mistake) and ate it.
 &HT;    Six hours later I discovered firsthand salmonella's incubation
period.
 &HT;    This week I went back to the restaurant for a fine traditional
meal: mashed potatoes, fresh bread and fried chicken. Tapioca
pudding wasn't on the menu.

&HT;     IN THE CALM AFTER CAMPAIGN STORM, MEXICO WAITS OUTCOME OF
PRESIDENTIAL RACE

<P>
   LEON, Mexico _ After months of mutual accusations and
bitterness, the heated race for the Mexican presidency is over. As
of Thursday, and until balloting ends Sunday night, candidates must
keep a low profile and cannot air television campaign ads.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, alcohol sales will be barred throughout the country
until the election is over.
</P>
<P>
   After a ride on horseback in Loma Blanca, outside Mexico City,
rancher Vicente Fox flew to his home state of Guanajuato, where
thousands of residents of the state capital, Leon, cheerfully
awaited the presidential candidate of the National Action Party
(PAN).
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one more minute!'' the former governor of Guanajuato said,
referring to the 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   PRI candidate Francisco Labastida flew from Mexico City to his
native state of Sinaloa. He once served as governor of the western
state. About 50,000 Labastida supporters, waving the PRI's green,
red and white colors, gathered at the city's plaza as the candidate
addressed the crowd shortly after 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a great emotion, with my heart in my hand, with women,
men, farmers and workers at my side, we will have the victory next
Sunday,'' said Labastida, dressed in his usual khaki pants and blue
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the first president who was born in Sinaloa and the
first who was secretary of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will support the countryside, I will work for all but I
won't forget my friends,'' Labastida said, referring to his mostly
rural state.
</P>
<P>
   He said his would be a ``popular government, not a populist
one,'' in a reference to what pundits call Fox's populist
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised a ``strong arm'' against crime, a worry in
Sinaloa, where drug crime has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Labastida called for conciliation and peace once final
election results are known.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is for there not to be rancor or hatred
among Mexicans,'' he said Tuesday in Cuernavaca, state of Morelos.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent polls show Labastida and Fox in a virtual dead
heat, making this the closest presidential race in the country's
history.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo appeared live on television Wednesday
and praised the candidates for running spirited campaigns. He also
told voters they could count on a fair and legal election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can trust that each one of us will vote in liberty, secrecy
and that each vote will count,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   In Leon, a city of 950,000, thousands gathered at the municipal
stadium to celebrate the man they believe will end PRI's
seven-decade control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just hours away from a new history for Mexico,'' Fox
told the crowd of 60,000. ``I will be a president of all the
people. I will extend my hand to everybody regardless of their
electoral preferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that if elected he would ask congress to form a
committee to confront Mexico's narcotics trafficking problems, one
of the sore points in its relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Along the main Lopez Mateos Boulevard late Wednesday, families
in station wagons and workmen in trucks honked their horns in
support of Fox. Blue-and-white PAN flags fluttered from car
windows.
</P>
<P>
   On a more somber note, Fox's national campaign manager, in Leon
for the festivities, denounced alleged coercion tactics by the PRI
in four states.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptics here believe the PRI will eke out yet another
presidential victory with its extensive social programs and
insinuations that a Fox win would cost poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But the thousands of people crowding Leon's streets were
confident of a Fox victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm here: it's like a soccer match, only more
important. Mexico's future will be decided,'' said Humberto
Bonilla, holding a cardboard image of the V-for-Victory salute that
Fox has used throughout his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old operator of a leather shop and his nephew Ivan
Hernandez Bonilla, walking to the stadium, were undaunted by
streaks of lightening and threatening clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain would be a blessing. The heavens are crying tears of
happiness!'' said Hernandez, 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viva Mexico! Viva Vicente Fox!''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist
Democratic Revolutionary Party is running a distant third in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, he rejected a plea from Fox to join his team,
which would assure the PAN the presidential win.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas, who many believe won the 1988 presidential election
only to have it stolen from him by PRI, charges that Fox, a former
Coca-Cola executive, caters to U.S. interests and would privatize
the oil monopoly Pemex, nationalized since 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Cardenas spoke to a crowd in Ciudad del
Carmen, repeating his campaign message that the oil industry was a
metaphor for the country, a promising resource that has been
misused by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 70 million people are eligible to vote Sunday at 114,000
polling stations throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   The elections are being monitored by the independent Federal
Electoral Institute, which will send out 800,000 observers to
polling stations.

 By WILLIAM SPEED WEED 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' Without reading
that sentence from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address again, you can
probably recite most of the words because they're stored in your
short-term memory, that bustling depot of the brain where fleeting
ideas come and go but never stay.
 &HT;    Long-term memory is another thing. Most people would have to
read the sentence out loud, write it down and test themselves
repeatedly to get it permanently down pat.
 &HT;    Repetition is the mother of all learning because our brains must
undergo a physical change in order to form a long-term memory:
Neurons have to grow new connections to one another to create a
structural basis for whatever it is we'll remember _ be it a fresh
idea, a telephone number or a famous speech. As anyone who's ever
been a student knows, memory construction takes work.
 &HT;    But what if you could swallow a little pill that gave you a
photographic memory, the ability to form long-term memories
instantly? With such a pill, the world as a whole would long
remember, for the first time in history, anything it wanted to.
 &HT;    Clinical trials for a memory-enhancing drug are just two to five
years away, say Jerry Yin and Tim Tully of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.
 &HT;    At the center of their work is a protein that helps nerve cells
in the brain store memories. A sudden increase in the activity
levels of the protein sends the memory-making process into
overdrive and allows neurons to make long-lasting storage
structures immediately, without the slow work of repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully first discovered the importance of this memory
protein (a form of CREB, for Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding
protein) while working with fruit flies.
 &HT;    They created two new, genetically altered strains of fruit fly:
one with extremely high levels of memory protein and one with
almost none of it. Then they conditioned the flies by placing them
in tubes and blowing in scented air currents. One scent ``smelled
like my tennis shoes in July,'' Tully says. The other smelled like
licorice and was accompanied by a small electric shock. A fly that
is zapped every time it smells licorice should eventually build a
set of neural connections that says, ``Avoid licorice!''
 &HT;    The question is: How much repetition does it take for that
long-term memory to form?
 &HT;    Yin and Tully tested the flies by placing them in the middle of
a double-ended tube and blowing tennis-shoe scent in one end and
licorice scent in the other.
 &HT;    Flies with normal levels of the memory protein needed to be
zapped 10 times before they stopped moving toward the licorice
scent. In other words, they could build the neural connections
needed for an ``Avoid licorice!'' memory, but it required spaced
repetition _ just as normal humans must say a sentence over and
over again to memorize it.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully then tested a strain with low levels of memory
protein and found that those poor flies never made the structural
changes necessary for lasting memory. No matter how many shocks
they received, they went for licorice scent as often as they went
for tennis-shoe scent.
 &HT;    The flies with an overabundance of memory protein formed
long-term memory instantly. After only one trial, they knew to
avoid licorice the rest of their lives.
 &HT;    Tully points out that these flies haven't gotten smarter _
they'll never solve quadratic equations. Extra memory protein
simply accelerates the pace of memorization by eliminating the need
for repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully suspect that the memory protein is a sort of
construction-crew foreman in the brain that turns on the genes
neurons need to grow new connections, a process that normally
occurs bit by bit with repetition. When a brain is awash in memory
protein, the building process occurs all at once.
 &HT;    ``You require less training to initiate memory,'' Tully says.
``That's a dramatic switch.''
 &HT;    The finding could ultimately have dramatic implications for all
of us because it is overwhelmingly likely that memory protein has
essentially the same role in human brains as it does in fly brains.
 &HT;    The pharmaceutical challenge Yin and Tully must solve _ and they
say they're close _ is to find a compact chemical that can
infiltrate neurons, stimulate an overproduction of the protein and
thereby give the human brain a hurry-up, neural-connection
construction crew.
 &HT;    This pop-a-pill enhancement is expected to last only a few hours
before memory protein levels return to normal, but while levels are
up, we'll be like the one-zap flies, with supercharged
memory-making.
 &HT;    What great news! Wash down a pill, read one of Shakespeare's
plays, and you'll know it by heart! Learn a new language in a month
_ without flash cards! Get a law degree in one semester!
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless _ which is itself a problem.
Perhaps the reason evolution made repetition the mother of learning
is that repetition ensures that you remember only what you try to
remember.
 &HT;    On memory pills, you take the chance of memorizing the
ingredients on your cereal box, the disclaimer at the end of the
movie and every word of that annoying conversation you heard on the
bus. The minutiae that once flitted lightly through your short-term
memory will lodge in your brain forever, like it or not.
 &HT;    ``We're not sure society is ready for this,'' Yin admits.
 &HT;    It might be best, he says, to administer the pill only to people
with certain types of mental retardation that compromise memory.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he adds, ``if we really have something that's the
neuronal equivalent of Viagra, it's going to get out.''

 By DANIEL C. WEAVER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At 4 a.m. on a still-black Monday morning, 76-year-old Robert
Kilgalen came to the emergency room gripping his stomach. His wife
said he'd been alternating between explosive diarrhea and vomiting
for two hours.
 &HT;    He was so dizzy from loss of fluid that he could hardly stand,
and his temperature was 101.5 degrees.
 &HT;    The staff started him on fluids intravenously, then began to
examine him for clues. Toxic chemicals, viruses and pathogenic
bacteria such as shigella, E. coli and salmonella can cause
debilitating diarrhea. But sometimes chronic intestinal
inflammation can provoke it too.
 &HT;    The first step was to examine blood and stool cultures for
infection. The following day, Ellie, the lab technician, came up
from the microbiology lab. She held a small glass vial of stool
culture up to the light. ``Look. There's nothing, not even normal
flora.''
 &HT;    The antibiotics the patient had taken on the way to the hospital
had wiped out any telltale signs. The other lab results indicated
only dehydration and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. We
hadn't a clue what was wrong.
 &HT;    But before long, a feverish 8-year-old girl arrived, sick from
vomiting and diarrhea. Then an 81-year-old woman and a 3-month-old
boy came in with the same symptoms.
 &HT;    Was this the start of an epidemic? None of the new patients had
taken antibiotics, so I hoped one of the cultures would be
positive.
 &HT;    The following morning Ellie showed me the tubes. I could see
that the samples teemed with bacterial colonies. She took small
samples of the fluid and spread it out on agar plates specially
prepared to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and suppress
normal gut flora.
 &HT;    The next morning I went into the lab and Ellie opened the
incubator containing the cultures. She held the agar plate under
the light. There were hundreds of shiny black colonies _
salmonella. All three cultures, she said, were positive.
 &HT;    As many as 4 million salmonella cases break out in the United
States each year, making it the country's most common food
poisoning. More than 2,000 varieties of the bacterium live in the
guts of such animals as pigs, cows and chickens, without causing
them harm. (The infection can also pass from a hen to her eggs.)
 &HT;    One type _ Salmonella typhi _ lives only in humans. It causes
typhoid fever, which can be deadly. While typhoid fever is not
uncommon in countries with poor sewage treatment, it is rare in the
United States.
 &HT;    To thrive in a human, salmonellae must survive the acidic
conditions in the stomach, reach the small intestine and attach to
its lining. If enough live salmonellae get to the intestine,
diarrhea and vomiting _ the host's effort to expel the pathogen _
will follow within six to 48 hours.
 &HT;    In severe cases, the bacteria can slip into the bloodstream and
cause systemic infections. And in rare instances, mostly occurring
in the very young, weak or old, salmonella infection can lead to
death from dehydration or septic shock.
 &HT;    Given the timing of their illnesses, I guessed that all four
patients must have had a common source of infection. I talked with
each patient's doctor and learned that all but the 3-month-old had
recently eaten tapioca at a local restaurant. The 3-month-old,
whose parents were turkey farmers, proved to be infected with a
different type of salmonella.
 &HT;    Next I notified the state board of health. An inspector found
the problem: The restaurant's tapioca cooker wasn't heating the
pudding enough to kill bacteria. Instead it was warming the pudding
just enough to help bacteria grow. In the end, 13 diners at the
restaurant were diagnosed with salmonella food poisoning.
 &HT;    The key to controlling salmonella is understanding its rapid
growth. Bacterial colonies can double every 20 minutes, a rate of
growth so exponential that a single colony bred under perfect
conditions could reach the size of Earth in less than 48 hours.
 &HT;    Salmonellae grow best at about 100 degrees, making the human
body a great host. Keeping food colder than 40 degrees or hotter
than 140 degrees reins in bacterial growth remarkably.
 &HT;    Although restaurant outbreaks make the news, most food
poisonings probably occur at home. I know just how this can happen.
Some 20 years ago, to save money during my residency, I dialed my
refrigerator thermostat up to 45 degrees (my first mistake). Then I
made meat loaf with eggs, failing to cook it long enough (second
mistake), left it overnight on the counter (third mistake), put it
back in the refrigerator (fourth mistake), reheated it in a
microwave oven (fifth mistake) and ate it.
 &HT;    Six hours later I discovered firsthand salmonella's incubation
period.
 &HT;    This week I went back to the restaurant for a fine traditional
meal: mashed potatoes, fresh bread and fried chicken. Tapioca
pudding wasn't on the menu.

than 140 degrees reins in bacterial growth remarkably.
 &HT;    Although restaurant outbreaks make the news, most food
poisonings probably occur at home. I know just how this can happen.
Some 20 years ago, to save money during my residency, I dialed my
refrigerator thermostat up to 45 degrees (my first mistake). Then I
made meat loaf with eggs, failing to cook it long enough (second
mistake), left it overnight on the counter (third mistake), put it
back in the refrigerator (fourth mistake), reheated it in a
microwave oven (fifth mistake) and ate it.
 &HT;    Six hours later I discovered firsthand salmonella's incubation
period.
 &HT;    This week I went back to the restaurant for a fine traditional
meal: mashed potatoes, fresh bread and fried chicken. Tapioca
pudding wasn't on the menu.

 (One color slide is included.) 
 By DANIEL C. WEAVER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At 4 a.m. on a still-black Monday morning, 76-year-old Robert
Kilgalen came to the emergency room gripping his stomach. His wife
said he'd been alternating between explosive diarrhea and vomiting
for two hours.
 &HT;    He was so dizzy from loss of fluid that he could hardly stand,
and his temperature was 101.5 degrees.
 &HT;    The staff started him on fluids intravenously, then began to
examine him for clues. Toxic chemicals, viruses and pathogenic
bacteria such as shigella, E. coli and salmonella can cause
debilitating diarrhea. But sometimes chronic intestinal
inflammation can provoke it too.
 &HT;    The first step was to examine blood and stool cultures for
infection. The following day, Ellie, the lab technician, came up
from the microbiology lab. She held a small glass vial of stool
culture up to the light. ``Look. There's nothing, not even normal
flora.''
 &HT;    The antibiotics the patient had taken on the way to the hospital
had wiped out any telltale signs. The other lab results indicated
only dehydration and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. We
hadn't a clue what was wrong.
 &HT;    But before long, a feverish 8-year-old girl arrived, sick from
vomiting and diarrhea. Then an 81-year-old woman and a 3-month-old
boy came in with the same symptoms.
 &HT;    Was this the start of an epidemic? None of the new patients had
taken antibiotics, so I hoped one of the cultures would be
positive.
 &HT;    The following morning Ellie showed me the tubes. I could see
that the samples teemed with bacterial colonies. She took small
samples of the fluid and spread it out on agar plates specially
prepared to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria and suppress
normal gut flora.
 &HT;    The next morning I went into the lab and Ellie opened the
incubator containing the cultures. She held the agar plate under
the light. There were hundreds of shiny black colonies _
salmonella. All three cultures, she said, were positive.
 &HT;    As many as 4 million salmonella cases break out in the United
States each year, making it the country's most common food
poisoning. More than 2,000 varieties of the bacterium live in the
guts of such animals as pigs, cows and chickens, without causing
them harm. (The infection can also pass from a hen to her eggs.)
 &HT;    One type _ Salmonella typhi _ lives only in humans. It causes
typhoid fever, which can be deadly. While typhoid fever is not
uncommon in countries with poor sewage treatment, it is rare in the
United States.
 &HT;    To thrive in a human, salmonellae must survive the acidic
conditions in the stomach, reach the small intestine and attach to
its lining. If enough live salmonellae get to the intestine,
diarrhea and vomiting _ the host's effort to expel the pathogen _
will follow within six to 48 hours.
 &HT;    In severe cases, the bacteria can slip into the bloodstream and
cause systemic infections. And in rare instances, mostly occurring
in the very young, weak or old, salmonella infection can lead to
death from dehydration or septic shock.
 &HT;    Given the timing of their illnesses, I guessed that all four
patients must have had a common source of infection. I talked with
each patient's doctor and learned that all but the 3-month-old had
recently eaten tapioca at a local restaurant. The 3-month-old,
whose parents were turkey farmers, proved to be infected with a
different type of salmonella.
 &HT;    Next I notified the state board of health. An inspector found
the problem: The restaurant's tapioca cooker wasn't heating the
pudding enough to kill bacteria. Instead it was warming the pudding
just enough to help bacteria grow. In the end, 13 diners at the
restaurant were diagnosed with salmonella food poisoning.
 &HT;    The key to controlling salmonella is understanding its rapid
growth. Bacterial colonies can double every 20 minutes, a rate of
growth so exponential that a single colony bred under perfect
conditions could reach the size of Earth in less than 48 hours.
 &HT;    Salmonellae grow best at about 100 degrees, making the human
body a great host. Keeping food colder than 40 degrees or hotter
than 140 degrees reins in bacterial growth remarkably.
 &HT;    Although restaurant outbreaks make the news, most food
poisonings probably occur at home. I know just how this can happen.
Some 20 years ago, to save money during my residency, I dialed my
refrigerator thermostat up to 45 degrees (my first mistake). Then I
made meat loaf with eggs, failing to cook it long enough (second
mistake), left it overnight on the counter (third mistake), put it
back in the refrigerator (fourth mistake), reheated it in a
microwave oven (fifth mistake) and ate it.
 &HT;    Six hours later I discovered firsthand salmonella's incubation

 (One color illustration is included.) 
 By WILLIAM SPEED WEED 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' Without reading
that sentence from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address again, you can
probably recite most of the words because they're stored in your
short-term memory, that bustling depot of the brain where fleeting
ideas come and go but never stay.
 &HT;    Long-term memory is another thing. Most people would have to
read the sentence out loud, write it down and test themselves
repeatedly to get it permanently down pat.
 &HT;    Repetition is the mother of all learning because our brains must
undergo a physical change in order to form a long-term memory:
Neurons have to grow new connections to one another to create a
structural basis for whatever it is we'll remember _ be it a fresh
idea, a telephone number or a famous speech. As anyone who's ever
been a student knows, memory construction takes work.
 &HT;    But what if you could swallow a little pill that gave you a
photographic memory, the ability to form long-term memories
instantly? With such a pill, the world as a whole would long
remember, for the first time in history, anything it wanted to.
 &HT;    Clinical trials for a memory-enhancing drug are just two to five
years away, say Jerry Yin and Tim Tully of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.
 &HT;    At the center of their work is a protein that helps nerve cells
in the brain store memories. A sudden increase in the activity
levels of the protein sends the memory-making process into
overdrive and allows neurons to make long-lasting storage
structures immediately, without the slow work of repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully first discovered the importance of this memory
protein (a form of CREB, for Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding
protein) while working with fruit flies.
 &HT;    They created two new, genetically altered strains of fruit fly:
one with extremely high levels of memory protein and one with
almost none of it. Then they conditioned the flies by placing them
in tubes and blowing in scented air currents. One scent ``smelled
like my tennis shoes in July,'' Tully says. The other smelled like
licorice and was accompanied by a small electric shock. A fly that
is zapped every time it smells licorice should eventually build a
set of neural connections that says, ``Avoid licorice!''
 &HT;    The question is: How much repetition does it take for that
long-term memory to form?
 &HT;    Yin and Tully tested the flies by placing them in the middle of
a double-ended tube and blowing tennis-shoe scent in one end and
licorice scent in the other.
 &HT;    Flies with normal levels of the memory protein needed to be
zapped 10 times before they stopped moving toward the licorice
scent. In other words, they could build the neural connections
needed for an ``Avoid licorice!'' memory, but it required spaced
repetition _ just as normal humans must say a sentence over and
over again to memorize it.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully then tested a strain with low levels of memory
protein and found that those poor flies never made the structural
changes necessary for lasting memory. No matter how many shocks
they received, they went for licorice scent as often as they went
for tennis-shoe scent.
 &HT;    The flies with an overabundance of memory protein formed
long-term memory instantly. After only one trial, they knew to
avoid licorice the rest of their lives.
 &HT;    Tully points out that these flies haven't gotten smarter _
they'll never solve quadratic equations. Extra memory protein
simply accelerates the pace of memorization by eliminating the need
for repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully suspect that the memory protein is a sort of
construction-crew foreman in the brain that turns on the genes
neurons need to grow new connections, a process that normally
occurs bit by bit with repetition. When a brain is awash in memory
protein, the building process occurs all at once.
 &HT;    ``You require less training to initiate memory,'' Tully says.
``That's a dramatic switch.''
 &HT;    The finding could ultimately have dramatic implications for all
of us because it is overwhelmingly likely that memory protein has
essentially the same role in human brains as it does in fly brains.
 &HT;    The pharmaceutical challenge Yin and Tully must solve _ and they
say they're close _ is to find a compact chemical that can
infiltrate neurons, stimulate an overproduction of the protein and
thereby give the human brain a hurry-up, neural-connection
construction crew.
 &HT;    This pop-a-pill enhancement is expected to last only a few hours
before memory protein levels return to normal, but while levels are
up, we'll be like the one-zap flies, with supercharged
memory-making.
 &HT;    What great news! Wash down a pill, read one of Shakespeare's
plays, and you'll know it by heart! Learn a new language in a month
_ without flash cards! Get a law degree in one semester!
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless _ which is itself a problem.
Perhaps the reason evolution made repetition the mother of learning
is that repetition ensures that you remember only what you try to
remember.
 &HT;    On memory pills, you take the chance of memorizing the
ingredients on your cereal box, the disclaimer at the end of the
movie and every word of that annoying conversation you heard on the
bus. The minutiae that once flitted lightly through your short-term
memory will lodge in your brain forever, like it or not.
 &HT;    ``We're not sure society is ready for this,'' Yin admits.
 &HT;    It might be best, he says, to administer the pill only to people
with certain types of mental retardation that compromise memory.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he adds, ``if we really have something that's the
neuronal equivalent of Viagra, it's going to get out.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' Without reading
that sentence from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address again, you can
probably recite most of the words because they're stored in your
short-term memory, that bustling depot of the brain where fleeting
ideas come and go but never stay.
 &HT;    Long-term memory is another thing. Most people would have to
read the sentence out loud, write it down and test themselves
repeatedly to get it permanently down pat.
 &HT;    Repetition is the mother of all learning because our brains must
undergo a physical change in order to form a long-term memory:
Neurons have to grow new connections to one another to create a
structural basis for whatever it is we'll remember _ be it a fresh
idea, a telephone number or a famous speech. As anyone who's ever
been a student knows, memory construction takes work.
 &HT;    But what if you could swallow a little pill that gave you a
photographic memory, the ability to form long-term memories
instantly? With such a pill, the world as a whole would long
remember, for the first time in history, anything it wanted to.
 &HT;    Clinical trials for a memory-enhancing drug are just two to five
years away, say Jerry Yin and Tim Tully of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.
 &HT;    At the center of their work is a protein that helps nerve cells
in the brain store memories. A sudden increase in the activity
levels of the protein sends the memory-making process into
overdrive and allows neurons to make long-lasting storage
structures immediately, without the slow work of repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully first discovered the importance of this memory
protein (a form of CREB, for Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding
protein) while working with fruit flies.
 &HT;    They created two new, genetically altered strains of fruit fly:
one with extremely high levels of memory protein and one with
almost none of it. Then they conditioned the flies by placing them
in tubes and blowing in scented air currents. One scent ``smelled
like my tennis shoes in July,'' Tully says. The other smelled like
licorice and was accompanied by a small electric shock. A fly that
is zapped every time it smells licorice should eventually build a
set of neural connections that says, ``Avoid licorice!''
 &HT;    The question is: How much repetition does it take for that
long-term memory to form?
 &HT;    Yin and Tully tested the flies by placing them in the middle of
a double-ended tube and blowing tennis-shoe scent in one end and
licorice scent in the other.
 &HT;    Flies with normal levels of the memory protein needed to be
zapped 10 times before they stopped moving toward the licorice
scent. In other words, they could build the neural connections
needed for an ``Avoid licorice!'' memory, but it required spaced
repetition _ just as normal humans must say a sentence over and
over again to memorize it.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully then tested a strain with low levels of memory
protein and found that those poor flies never made the structural
changes necessary for lasting memory. No matter how many shocks
they received, they went for licorice scent as often as they went
for tennis-shoe scent.
 &HT;    The flies with an overabundance of memory protein formed
long-term memory instantly. After only one trial, they knew to
avoid licorice the rest of their lives.
 &HT;    Tully points out that these flies haven't gotten smarter _
they'll never solve quadratic equations. Extra memory protein
simply accelerates the pace of memorization by eliminating the need
for repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully suspect that the memory protein is a sort of
construction-crew foreman in the brain that turns on the genes
neurons need to grow new connections, a process that normally
occurs bit by bit with repetition. When a brain is awash in memory
protein, the building process occurs all at once.
 &HT;    ``You require less training to initiate memory,'' Tully says.
``That's a dramatic switch.''
 &HT;    The finding could ultimately have dramatic implications for all
of us because it is overwhelmingly likely that memory protein has
essentially the same role in human brains as it does in fly brains.
 &HT;    The pharmaceutical challenge Yin and Tully must solve _ and they
say they're close _ is to find a compact chemical that can
infiltrate neurons, stimulate an overproduction of the protein and
thereby give the human brain a hurry-up, neural-connection
construction crew.
 &HT;    This pop-a-pill enhancement is expected to last only a few hours
before memory protein levels return to normal, but while levels are
up, we'll be like the one-zap flies, with supercharged
memory-making.
 &HT;    What great news! Wash down a pill, read one of Shakespeare's
plays, and you'll know it by heart! Learn a new language in a month
_ without flash cards! Get a law degree in one semester!
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless _ which is itself a problem.
Perhaps the reason evolution made repetition the mother of learning
is that repetition ensures that you remember only what you try to
remember.
 &HT;    On memory pills, you take the chance of memorizing the
ingredients on your cereal box, the disclaimer at the end of the
movie and every word of that annoying conversation you heard on the
bus. The minutiae that once flitted lightly through your short-term
memory will lodge in your brain forever, like it or not.
 &HT;    ``We're not sure society is ready for this,'' Yin admits.
 &HT;    It might be best, he says, to administer the pill only to people
with certain types of mental retardation that compromise memory.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he adds, ``if we really have something that's the
neuronal equivalent of Viagra, it's going to get out.''

   1. IDEOLOGY IS ALIVE AND KICKING IN THE SUPREME COURT, by Dahlia
Lithwick
</P>
<P>
   If you'd asked me after Monday's decision in Dickerson vs.
United States, I'd have said the Rehnquist Court was trying to
vaporize itself. How else to interpret the perplexing 7-2 Rehnquist
opinion finding both Congress and the court itself powerless to
overturn court precedent?
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's closing session of the 1999 term suggests that
the End of Ideology is not upon us. Ideology, specifically
religious ideology, is not just alive in the Supreme Court, but
kicking. It's pounding its fists and wailing. It wants its mother.
Or more correctly, its founding father.
</P>
<P>
   And what the cave-painters will fail to capture about
Wednesday's session is the palpable disgust and fury on the part of
Justices Thomas, Scalia and Kennedy as they watch their so-called
``moderate'' court spin out of their control.

   2. BILL RICHARDSON'S BAD CAREER MOVE, by David Plotz
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy, the Bermuda Triangle of Cabinet
agencies, could soon claim another victim. The Case of the Missing
Hard Disks has doomed Secretary Bill Richardson's aspiration to be
Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   During his days as an international troubleshooter, Richardson
liked being called ``007,'' but not even James Bond could escape
from the torture chamber Richardson is in now.
</P>
<P>
   His to the Los Alamos fiasco has been energetic shirking. He
whines that he doesn't deserve blame, and he passes the buck onto
careless Los Alamos scientists and their anti-security culture.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the best-natured of pols, Richardson is displaying an
uncharacteristic lack of grace. It's easy to understand why. He is
surely regretting one of the worst career moves in recent
Washington history: his 1998 promotion from U.N. ambassador to
energy secretary. Running DOE is like herding rattlesnakes.

   3. NOT EVERY DEPARTING PRESIDENT WADDLES OUT OF OFFICE, By David
Greenberg
</P>
<P>
   Has any president been written off as a lame duck more often
than Bill Clinton? But what exactly is a lame duck?
</P>
<P>
   Properly speaking, lame ducks are those presidents occupying the
White House in the weeks between the election and the inauguration
of their successors. ``Lame duck'' is typically slung as a
pejorative, depicting the outgoing president as someone who has
little hope of disciplining his party, influencing legislation, or
seeing his appointments confirmed. Certainly, some presidents have
gone comatose in the interval between the successor's election and
inauguration, occasionally with baleful consequences. But it's
often forgotten that some presidents have used the time to act
boldly and to leave a mark on history.

   4. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOM GORE AND BUSH PICK, by Steve Chapman
</P>
<P>
   Between the time a presidential candidate clinches his party's
nomination and the moment he stands before the convention to kick
off the general election campaign, he must make a daunting
decision: choose someone to serve as his running mate and, in case
of victory, his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   During this interval, the presidential candidates contemplate
and the political strategists and pundits argue the advantages and
disadvantages of the prospects _ weighing elements of geography,
ideology, personal history, ethnicity, religion, campaign skills,
and personal compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the most fascinating and suspenseful questions of
the entire campaign _ and, from a political standpoint, one of the
least important.

 By WILLIAM SPEED WEED 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    ``The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' Without reading
that sentence from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address again, you can
probably recite most of the words because they're stored in your
short-term memory, that bustling depot of the brain where fleeting
ideas come and go but never stay.
 &HT;    Long-term memory is another thing. Most people would have to
read the sentence out loud, write it down and test themselves
repeatedly to get it permanently down pat.
 &HT;    Repetition is the mother of all learning because our brains must
undergo a physical change in order to form a long-term memory:
Neurons have to grow new connections to one another to create a
structural basis for whatever it is we'll remember _ be it a fresh
idea, a telephone number or a famous speech. As anyone who's ever
been a student knows, memory construction takes work.
 &HT;    But what if you could swallow a little pill that gave you a
photographic memory, the ability to form long-term memories
instantly? With such a pill, the world as a whole would long
remember, for the first time in history, anything it wanted to.
 &HT;    Clinical trials for a memory-enhancing drug are just two to five
years away, say Jerry Yin and Tim Tully of Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.
 &HT;    At the center of their work is a protein that helps nerve cells
in the brain store memories. A sudden increase in the activity
levels of the protein sends the memory-making process into
overdrive and allows neurons to make long-lasting storage
structures immediately, without the slow work of repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully first discovered the importance of this memory
protein (a form of CREB, for Cyclic AMP Response Element Binding
protein) while working with fruit flies.
 &HT;    They created two new, genetically altered strains of fruit fly:
one with extremely high levels of memory protein and one with
almost none of it. Then they conditioned the flies by placing them
in tubes and blowing in scented air currents. One scent ``smelled
like my tennis shoes in July,'' Tully says. The other smelled like
licorice and was accompanied by a small electric shock. A fly that
is zapped every time it smells licorice should eventually build a
set of neural connections that says, ``Avoid licorice!''
 &HT;    The question is: How much repetition does it take for that
long-term memory to form?
 &HT;    Yin and Tully tested the flies by placing them in the middle of
a double-ended tube and blowing tennis-shoe scent in one end and
licorice scent in the other.
 &HT;    Flies with normal levels of the memory protein needed to be
zapped 10 times before they stopped moving toward the licorice
scent. In other words, they could build the neural connections
needed for an ``Avoid licorice!'' memory, but it required spaced
repetition _ just as normal humans must say a sentence over and
over again to memorize it.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully then tested a strain with low levels of memory
protein and found that those poor flies never made the structural
changes necessary for lasting memory. No matter how many shocks
they received, they went for licorice scent as often as they went
for tennis-shoe scent.
 &HT;    The flies with an overabundance of memory protein formed
long-term memory instantly. After only one trial, they knew to
avoid licorice the rest of their lives.
 &HT;    Tully points out that these flies haven't gotten smarter _
they'll never solve quadratic equations. Extra memory protein
simply accelerates the pace of memorization by eliminating the need
for repetition.
 &HT;    Yin and Tully suspect that the memory protein is a sort of
construction-crew foreman in the brain that turns on the genes
neurons need to grow new connections, a process that normally
occurs bit by bit with repetition. When a brain is awash in memory
protein, the building process occurs all at once.
 &HT;    ``You require less training to initiate memory,'' Tully says.
``That's a dramatic switch.''
 &HT;    The finding could ultimately have dramatic implications for all
of us because it is overwhelmingly likely that memory protein has
essentially the same role in human brains as it does in fly brains.
 &HT;    The pharmaceutical challenge Yin and Tully must solve _ and they
say they're close _ is to find a compact chemical that can
infiltrate neurons, stimulate an overproduction of the protein and
thereby give the human brain a hurry-up, neural-connection
construction crew.
 &HT;    This pop-a-pill enhancement is expected to last only a few hours
before memory protein levels return to normal, but while levels are
up, we'll be like the one-zap flies, with supercharged
memory-making.
 &HT;    What great news! Wash down a pill, read one of Shakespeare's
plays, and you'll know it by heart! Learn a new language in a month
_ without flash cards! Get a law degree in one semester!
 &HT;    The possibilities are endless _ which is itself a problem.
Perhaps the reason evolution made repetition the mother of learning
is that repetition ensures that you remember only what you try to
remember.
 &HT;    On memory pills, you take the chance of memorizing the
ingredients on your cereal box, the disclaimer at the end of the
movie and every word of that annoying conversation you heard on the
bus. The minutiae that once flitted lightly through your short-term
memory will lodge in your brain forever, like it or not.
 &HT;    ``We're not sure society is ready for this,'' Yin admits.
 &HT;    It might be best, he says, to administer the pill only to people
with certain types of mental retardation that compromise memory.
 &HT;    ``But,'' he adds, ``if we really have something that's the
neuronal equivalent of Viagra, it's going to get out.''

 HAITIAN SCHOOL HOPES FOR MUSICAL REVIVAL  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Along a narrow concrete alley, where
people live jammed together under tin roofs, a skinny young girl in
pigtails sat in her front entryway and tucked a viola under her
chin.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Debora Tatgrin, played the instrument as if it were an
extension of herself, the long fingers of her left hand skipping
over its neck, performing Bach for the neighborhood dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Children on tiptoes appeared. They listened, eyes wide open.
Beneath them, trickles of filthy water flowed unnoticed past their
feet.
</P>
<P>
   When she finished, no one clapped. They only stared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so good when I play,'' said Debora, 11, holding the
viola to her chest. ``In my mind, nothing else matters when I'm
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gift of music, handed to Debora when she turned 7, may
run out for other Haitians.
</P>
<P>
   Her school, Haiti's only school of music, which has had a long
relationship with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, is going through
extraordinarily hard times. Its decay is emblematic of the decline
of institutions throughout Haiti that withered to nearly nothing
during the 1991-94 military coup government and have yet to find
new life in a barely functioning democracy. Nationwide
demonstrations this week have done little to reassure overseas
supporters that the nation can be poised for better times.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is hard to give up hope in certain corners of this
country, such as the alleyway outside Debora's home or the halls of
Holy Trinity School, which resound every day with scratchy bows on
violins and the bellowing of horns _ most of the instruments
stamped with the insignia of the school's chief benefactor, BSO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music to Haitians is a real necessity,'' said David Cesar, the
school's director, walking in a hallway. ``We play music all the
time. When we're happy. When we're sad. It doesn't matter. But
people in the United States see little of this part of Haiti. They
never hear about our music. They rarely hear about our art. They
hear only bad things about Haiti, about violence and lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is not the case for the school's donors, many of whom are
from the Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship began with a knock on the symphony's door in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a nun to see me,'' said Bill Moyer, then BSO's
personnel director, referring to Holy Trinity's founder, Sister
Anne Marie. ``She came in with her black robes and said, `I wonder
if you'd like to give any instruments to our school in Haiti.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the school, Moyer liked the idea, and
suggested setting up a partnership. Perhaps, he said, the Boston
orchestra could send teachers to Port-au-Prince for weeklong
tutorials _ as long as the school would feed them and provide beds.
Sister Anne Marie agreed, and the relationship was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of BSO players went down during their vacation weeks to
teach, and they came back totally turned on and refreshed by the
spirit this school gave, I guess, to tired musicians,'' said Moyer,
70, now retired.
</P>
<P>
   BSO invited Haitian musicians to its summer getaway at
Tanglewood. In 1976 and 1984, the 70-member Holy Trinity
Philarmonic Orchestra, Haiti's only orchestra, took up summer
residence at Tanglewood and played to appreciative crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a very uneven talent, but they had a beautiful
spirit,'' Moyer said. ``They played scratchy, but it was wonderful.
Many were kids. The assistant concert master, Romel Joseph, was
blind, and he played fantastic. Audiences loved them.''
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in 1986, when Haiti ushered out the Duvalier
dictatorship, and continuing for nearly a decade, the country
turned sporadically violent. The musicians' exchanges between
Boston and Port-au-Prince nearly stopped.
</P>
<P>
   When President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was restored to power in
1994, the friends of Holy Trinity began to raise money for the
school. During the next three years, they collected more than
$100,000, as well as dozens of instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Anne Marie died in 1996. Since then, the school has
struggled, Moyer said. The money was put into a New York bank,
where it remains.
</P>
<P>
   Some BSO musicians have gone to the school in the past few
years, but Moyer said most return ``discouraged. There isn't the
lively spirit the school used to have.''
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, donors have stopped giving. Teachers are
taking second and third jobs because of their low wages. Most
students, after spending days in overcrowded classrooms, must leave
their instruments at school because of rising rates of theft.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Haiti's Episcopal Bishop Zache Duracin, who oversees
the Port-au-Prince school, will meet with Moyer and other US
supporters in New York plan to chart Holy Trinity's future. The
bishop's goal is for the school to become autonomous and seek funds
from Haitian individuals and groups, instead of relying on
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, has become a theme for Haiti's organizations, which
are being forced to cope more and more without outside assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those beautiful efforts that has simply got to
succeed,'' Moyer said. ``There are too many great little kids down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Debora Tatgrin, the girl who plays the viola, and her mother
and two sisters, the troubles with the school might as well be a
world away. They believe music will transport them from Haiti, just
as it has a precious few of the school's thousands of graduates in
years past.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband liked music. He used to play the guitar,'' said
Guylene Charles Tatgrin, a widow whose husband died seven years ago
from a mysterious stomach illness. ``But I always wanted my kids to
play music. The school was my opportunity for them. That's why I
chose this school.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother took a job as sixth-grade teacher there to be closer
to them. She took a second job to be able to send them to music
camp in the summer. And she learned to read music, even though she
can't play, to better help them practice.
</P>
<P>
   Debora is the middle of three sisters. The oldest, Francoise,
15, plays the violin; the youngest, Rebecca, 10, plays the
clarinet. Each said she chose her instrument based on personal
preference, not to avoid possible competition with a sister.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Francoise achieved a breakthrough of sorts. She was
chosen to perform in Puerto Rico before a church group. ``When I
get in my 20s, I'll still be performing,'' Francoise said in the
family's 10-by-12-foot living room, which is crowded with a couch,
two chairs, and a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Debora, Francoise said, is exceptionally talented, a judgment
echoed by instructors at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the will, that's for sure,'' Francoise said. ``She's
not scared, not shy to say she doesn't understand something.''
</P>
<P>
   Debora allowed the slightest of smiles. Then she straightened
her back, composing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I will open my own music school when I turn 21, and
I will travel to many countries to play. I know this,'' she said
matter-of-factly, as if she has seen her future. ``I only hope that
my music will be pleasing to people. God gave me the intelligence.
God gave me the passion to play music. And God gave me the
confidence to play.''
</P>
<P>
   When the sisters' skill levels begin to intersect, they hope to
play as a trio. As their visitors prepared to leave the home, the
youngest sister, Rebecca, said that the family already has started
singing together.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the three stepped into the alleyway and, with
Francoise taking the lead, began singing ``Tell Me About Love'' in
Creole. They sang three-part harmony, their voices distinct and
loud and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   At the sound of music, an audience of children arrived on silent
feet. And they stared anew.

IN PETERSEN MUSEUM, LOS ANGELES IS THE CITY OF WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If there is a place where the automobile has been
inextricably woven into the culture, it is Southern California. It
has given racing, radical hot rods, cool custom jobs, drive-in food
joints, and a link between car, owner, and prestige not found
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   From burgers to Bugattis, lakesters to limousines, Southern
California has had it all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a history remarkably represented at The Petersen
Automotive Museum, 300,000 square feet of exhibition space on
Wilshire Boulevard in downtown (if this place has a downtown) Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Its exhibits are dedicated to the automobile and its influence
on American culture and our lives. On display at any time are more
than 100 race cars, classic cars, hot rods, motorcycles, cars from
television and the movies, and cars that belonged to celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   From re-created scenes in the streets of the early city to
rambles through the as-yet-undeveloped hills, an exhibit shows the
evolution of Los Angeles, from tight city center to nascent sprawl,
complete with one of the most advanced electric trolley
transportations in the world, to the present. It is a present where
the 101, the 405, and the 10 (where else do numbered routes get an
article before them?) define travel and place.
</P>
<P>
   Take a tour and see a 1911 American Underslung Model 50 Traveler
from the American Motor Car Co. stuck in the mud in the undeveloped
hills above Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   Check out early California racing by peering into the cockpit of
a 1915 Stutz White Squadron Racer, 130 horses of thunder once
driven on tracks by Earl Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond round-and-round racing, Southern California gave us
racing on the flats of dried lakebeds or in the desert. The
Southern California Speedshop exhibit gives us the history of the
lakester, highlighted by tank cars that were made from the
auxiliary fuel tanks of Lockheed P38 Lightnings. From sky to sandy
earth they helped define an era of straight-ahead speed, their Ford
flathead V-8s dominant in the early 1950s _ until the appearance of
the Chrysler Hemi.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most gorgeous _ and effective _ racers of the day is
here as well _ the famed Pierson Brothers Coupe. Radically chopped
so you wonder how the driver could even see, it ran under various
owners and with continually upgraded mechanics from 1949 to 1991,
increasing its top speeds from 153.06 mph to 227.33.
</P>
<P>
   It stands in cultural contrast to yet another highly
recognizable car here, the 1959 ``bucket'' of Ed ``Big Daddy''
Roth, cream-and-blue and sculpted with its engine exposed and
gleaming.
</P>
<P>
   There are dreams here as well: dreams failed and dreams
realized.
</P>
<P>
   You get the 1945 Tucker Torpedo that was the personal car of
Preston Tucker. That did not lead to any trends.
</P>
<P>
   And you get re-creations of early service stations and fast food
joints _ such as The Dog Cafi, shaped just like the name would
imply, or other drive-ups shaped like pumpkins or owls from the
1920s. They did signify a trend. Golden arches and white-bearded
colonels would one day take their place.
</P>
<P>
   The culture, of course, was replete with stars. The hoi polloi
were left wishing they could drive what the stars drove. So here we
find the 1960 Mercedes Benz 300 SL roadster of Robert Stack; Mel
Torme's 1937 Jaguar SS100 roadster; the 1953 Cadillac coupe by Ghia
of Rita Hayworth; Mel Blanc's 1958 Edsel; Fred Astaire's 1927 Rolls
Royce Phantom I Town Car; and for those moments when she wanted to
be alone in luxury on the road, Greta Garbo's 1925 Lincoln
limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler of publishing fame offers up his motorcycle
collection. It includes a 1953 Norton Dominator, a 1948 Vincent
HRD, a 1907 Indian, a 1929 Cleveland, and a 1941 Indian Dispatch
Tow. I'll give a printed tip of the hat to the first person who
e-mails me to say how the latter was used.
</P>
<P>
   With a recent donation of $25 million from automotive publishing
magnate Robert E. Petersen, the 6-year-old museum has retired its
debt and can now concentrate on a major goal: ensuring that the
exhibits do not become static.
</P>
<P>
   Street scenes may provide the spine of the museum, but all
around them, things change.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, cars from movies and television will be
featured. They follow exhibits such as the Duesenberg as a car for
powerful people; photographic images that reflect cars and culture;
pedal cars; postwar sports cars; woodies; early hot road
performance equipment; and the low-rider as art.
</P>
<P>
   With an ever-changing display, and a vault of treasures from
which to pluck cars and motorcycles, you won't get much static at
the Petersen.

SMALLER, LIGHTER OLDS AURORA CHASES THE SPORTY NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Two roads diverged in a wood . . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I know, somebody else already wrote that, but that's the
intersection at which General Motors found itself when it came time
for a redesign of the seven-year-old Oldsmobile Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Go big or go smaller?
</P>
<P>
   Smaller and lighter was the answer, and aluminum was a key.
</P>
<P>
   The 2001 Aurora is 165 pounds lighter in the V-8 model tested
and 6 inches shorter. Aluminum is showing up increasingly all
through cars, and the Aurora is riding the wave: aluminum engine
components, suspension parts, hood and trunk panels.
</P>
<P>
   This is a car that might have stayed larger had the Buick
Riviera been continued and provided a larger platform. But the
Riviera was put to pasture, and the result is a more modern,
snappier car that has a better chance of catching on with the niche
for which it is intended: younger, more affluent drivers that
Oldsmobile is hoping to attract.
</P>
<P>
   The Riviera-based model might have been, as they say, your
father's Oldsmobile. This one is not.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Olds will be to sell this new image in a sales
zone that is ever more crowded and highly competitive: midrange
luxury cars. Priced in the mid-30s, it will have to run with cars
such as the Lincoln LS, Lexus ES300, Infiniti I30, and the Acura
RL. And if you want to comparison shop, I'd try a Nissan Maxima and
an Acura TL, both fully loaded, and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   GM is making a move with the Aurora, trying to fit an American
car comfortably into this niche. They've got the comfort and
mechanics down here. Standard leather, walnut trim, lots of
driver-assist goodies. Now comes the selling.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the aggressive look.
</P>
<P>
   Stand at the front and gaze. It is very NASCAR-esque. No central
grille, that replaced by two grilled scoops at bumper line. A wide
stance and ridged flares leading back along the bulging front
fenders, through the doors and the back fenders. The rear is
chopped and sits high. The effect is one of a wedge when viewed
from the side.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, it is a study in comfort and good ergonomics. Front
leather buckets are firmly bolstered up the sides and along seat
edges. Support is good in all places. The dash drops sharply away,
giving good legroom. Rear seats are comfortable, even for three,
and firm as well. Legroom is OK, not great.
</P>
<P>
   Controls are well organized. The console at center dash is
slanted toward the driver, giving a good look at climate and audio
controls, all easily used because of large buttons and knobs.
</P>
<P>
   Climate and audio controls for the driver are repeated in the
steering wheel, and the driver's side door is a warehouse of
controls: seating memory, windows, mirrors, and, in a vast
improvement over the many cars that tuck these controls away on the
floor or beneath the seat, gas and trunk lid buttons are right
there where you can see them.
</P>
<P>
   The front-seat passenger gets to control climate over there with
a knob on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Interior storage space is only OK _ shallow pockets in the
doors, a shallow glove box, an ample bin between the seats.
Rear-seat passengers get pockets on the backs of the front seats.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider performance.
</P>
<P>
   You get a choice of two engines, both DOHC, one a 3.5-liter V-6,
the other a 4.0-liter V-8. The V-8 delivered a very nice 21.4 miles
per gallon in several days of round-the-town and commuter driving.
</P>
<P>
   It was peppy, throaty, and reminiscent of the Monte Carlo SS I'd
driven a few weeks back. The four-speed automatic let the engine
wind out properly before shifting up, an important touch in a car
whose audience may be looking for at least a modicum of
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension _ 4-wheel independent with struts, coil springs,
and anti-roll bars _ struck me as a bit soft. That meant a very
smooth ride cruising on the highway with some hints of body roll
while cornering. Vented disc brakes stopped it quickly though there
was a tendency, when braking hard, to understeer. Not to fear. ABS
and traction control were noticeable in quickly correcting any
tendencies that could lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Aurora is sporty, powerful, and luxurious. Now it has to
make a name for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The through-box from trunk to cabin that is concealed between
the center-rear-seat armrest. Great for skis, fishing poles, other
toys.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --The outside mirrors are too narrow, which confines vision.
Fatter, aerodynamic mirrors are possible.

KOHL CRITICIZES HIS TREATMENT DURING INVESTIGATION OF PARTY
FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ With a swaggering contempt for his accusers, former
chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared Thursday before a parliamentary
committee investigating financial misdeeds under his rule and said
he was a victim of slander.
</P>
<P>
   In hours of rambling testimony and subsequent exchanges with
journalists, Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998, said the
parliamentary investigation amounted to ``an attempt to drag 16
good years through the mud'' and an ``act of unprecedented
defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   His stance was consistent with the defiance he has shown since
his admission last December that he had taken about $1 million in
undeclared, and so illicit, payments from donors and used the money
to bolster his Christian Democratic party in the formerly communist
eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who took the money between 1993 and 1998, has refused to
name the donors, and on Thursday he said that he had ``no intention
of naming them.'' Just as he had given his word that Germany would
give up the mark for the euro, so he had promised that the donors
would remain anonymous, he added.
</P>
<P>
   His attempt to draw an analogy between a promise that Germany
would adopt Europe's common currency and a promise that illegal
donations would remain secret was the latest of a series of odd
declarations from Kohl. Last week, he compared the ostracism he
believes he is suffering to that of the Jews under Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about that much-criticized reference to the
persecution of Jews, Kohl, 70, shot back: ``I do not need any
private tuition on history. As far as the relationship with the
Jews is concerned, I suggest you go to Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. There
you will find out who among living German politicians is held in
highest regard.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unquestionable that Kohl's international reputation
remains high, a tribute above all to his deft handling of German
unification in 1990. But the hubris he has shown as his party has
reeled from a scandal involving the revelation that millions of
dollars were paid in secret to the Christian Democrats has hurt his
domestic standing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This had been an unprecedented attempt to defame me through
inaccurate reports, insinuations and twisting of the facts to
criminalize me,'' Kohl told the parliamentary committee. He singled
out reports in the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and ``on that
e-mail thing _ whatever it's called _ I mean, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Kohl veered between anger and jocularity.
When the proceedings began a little late, the former chancellor
shouted: ``Mr. Chairman, when may we commence this zoological
event?''
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came the day after Burkhard Hirsch, a former vice
president of the parliament, told the committee that in the days
after Kohl's electoral defeat in September 1998, most of the files
in the chancellery were destroyed. ``This massive erasure of data
had no legal basis,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl dismissed as ``stupid'' anyone who could believe that
millions of files had been destroyed, insisting that all the people
around him were ``honorable'' and that there was no motive for such
an act of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said Wednesday that computer experts had managed to
retrieve one file showing that letters ostensibly written by four
state premiers calling on the government not to investigate
privatizations in the former East Germany had in fact been prepared
in the chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   One of these privatizations, that of the Leuna oil refinery, has
been the object of particular scrutiny because of the apparently
inflated price paid for it by Elf Aquitaine of France and because
of evidence that kickbacks were paid to several agents.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said accusations that the sale was corrupt and that his
party may have benefited from the kickbacks were ``a scandalous
distortion of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It became clear that it was going to be hard to
find an investor for Leuna. In the end, only Elf showed the
necessary commitment. I spoke to President Mitterrand and he agreed
that the involvement of a large French company in Leuna would have
great psychological significance in the former East Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement appeared to be the first time that Kohl had
acknowledged speaking to Mitterrand about the sale before it went
through. The French president had been wary of German unification;
the transaction became a symbol of restored political trust between
Europe's central allies.
</P>
<P>
   As for another suspect sale _ that of 36 German tanks to Saudi
Arabia in 1991 _ Kohl said it was made with the express blessing of
former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker after the United States
criticized Germany for not sending troops to help the Allied effort
to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no knowledge of bribery in this deal,'' Kohl said. ``It
did not happen. I have never been corrupt.'' The former
second-ranking military official in his government, Ludwig-Holger
Pfahls, has disappeared after being accused of receiving $2 million
in a Swiss bank account for his role in facilitating the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor, who has raised over $3 million to pay
back a fine imposed on the party for its actions under his rule,
said more than once that he had ``made mistakes.'' But he also said
more than once that he was not and had never been ``for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary investigation is expected to end later this
year. It will make recommendations on campaign financing and give a
detailed account of Kohl's actions. But the former chancellor is
very unlikely to face any formal sanction.

 &HT;    BIRTHS DECLINING AMONG RIGHT WHALES
 &HT;    760&AMP;add. For release Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Biologists who monitor the behavior of endangered
northern right whales spotted only one newborn calf this year in
aerial surveys of waters off the coasts of Florida, Georgia and
South Carolina, where females go to give birth.
</P>
<P>
   The single recorded birth followed three births last year and
six in 1998. The decline has prompted environmentalists to issue an
urgent appeal for action by the governments of the United States
and Canada to help ward off extinction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, whale biologists have drawn up research plans that
will involve, among other things, collecting and analyzing whale
feces for clues about the declining birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 300 northern right whales are known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   This year's one-ton calf was spotted off Ossabaw Island on Jan.
22, swimming beside its mother, a female that biologists call ``Mom
1334.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The area between Brunswick, Ga., and Jacksonville is the only
calving ground for these animals, and we really don't know why,''
said Chris Slay, an Athens, Ga., biologist who recorded the birth
as part of an annual census compiled for the New England Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   There are probably several reasons, he said, including shallow
water and relatively calm seas caused by the fact that the Atlantic
Coast swings sharply westward between Cape Hatteras, N.C. and Cape
Canaveral, Fla., creating a sort of embayment.
</P>
<P>
   The whales were prized in the 1700s and 1800s by whalers, who
gave them their name. Because they were easy, slow-swimming targets
and floated when they were killed, they became known as the ``right
whale'' to go for. They were hunted to the brink of extinction a
century ago, when only a few dozen were left.
</P>
<P>
   A larger population of right whales exists in southern oceans,
but biologists say genetic studies indicate it has been tens of
thousands of years since ancestors of the two groups interbred.
</P>
<P>
   Although northern right whales have slowly fought their way back
from near-extinction, the population has begun to decline again in
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The largest causes of right whale death are collisions with
ships and deadly encounters with nets and other fishing gear, said
Karen Baragona, a whale and dolphin specialist with the World
Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really tough problem, but we don't think it's
completely intractable,'' Baragona said.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen, the U.S. Navy and shipping companies all are eager to
cooperate in efforts to save the right whale, she said. The
organization is calling on the International Whaling Commission,
which meets this week (July 3) in Adelaide, Australia, to pass a
resolution urging countries whose waters are frequented by the
whales to set up habitat protection zones.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the International Maritime Organization passed a
reporting requirement that mariners report right whale sightings so
other ships can change course to avoid to ponderous, 100-ton
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Baragona said, shipping companies have indicated a
willingness to work with authorities in Canada to declare an area
of the Bay of Fundy between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia an ``area
to be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeding area for about two-thirds of northern right whales
is in the middle of a heavily traveled shipping lane in the Bay of
Fundy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising near the surface of the bay, straining plankton from
the water, right whales swim too slowly to get out of the way of
ships. Larger vessels, such as oil tankers, can't change course
quickly enough to avoid a collision, even when a whale is spotted,
Baragona said.
</P>
<P>
   She said there is room to shift the lanes a few miles to the
southeast, a move that would allow ships to bypass whales.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 60 percent of all right whales photo-identified by
scientists show scars assumed to be caused by fishing gear and nets
or vessels, although most whales involved in collisions with ships
are believed to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   With shipping and fishing interests expressing eagerness to
cooperate in efforts to protect the whales, the low birth rates are
the most worrisome problem.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have no idea why the birth rates have
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fewer calves in recent years, the number of of
years between calves is lengthening for each cow, said Moira Brown,
a whale biologist with the Center for Coastal Studies in
Provincetown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, they have had calves about every three years,'' she
said. ``That seems to mean a year of gestation, a year of nursing
and a year to rest. But the mean period between calving is now over
five years.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   There are two groups of females, Brown said, one group known as
the ``Fundy females,'' because they take their calves to the Bay of
Fundy to feed during the summer, and ``non-Fundy females,'' whose
feeding area is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups go to the Georgia-Florida coast to calve. Weather
permitting, Slay flies over the Georgia-Florida coastal waters
every day during calving season, which runs from December through
March. Only if a cow and her calf can be photographed is the new
whale officially added to the census.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the non-Fundy females have continued to produce
calves at the traditional rate. The Fundy females have not,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Slay's airborne surveys haven't spotted a Fundy calf in
three years, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that pollution, possibly by hormone-mimicking
chemicals, has reached a threshold that has disrupted the cows'
reproductive rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wouldn't seem likely that this would happen to all of
the cows at the same time, regardless of their ages,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that inbreeding has caused a genetic problem.
This also seems implausible, she said, because the population was
much smaller at the beginning of the 20th century than it is now,
and genetic weaknesses likely would have been purged decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still another possibility is that some natural variation in
plankton biology is taking place as a result of La Nina-El Nino
weather cycles or some other unknown factor, and this is disrupting
the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a cow does not have enough stored fat to support the fetus,
she cannot bring it to term,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Whale fecal samples may help solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They typically defecate at the surface, so we can simply motor
over and collect a sample,'' she said. ``We will analyze it to see
if there are hormones that indicate she is pregnant while she's in
the Bay of Fundy during the summer. Then if she is not pregnant in
Georgia that winter, that will be an indication that she is not
getting enough to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``In our hearts, we hope this is some natural cycle
and they will cycle out of it.''

 (One color slide is available.) 
 By JESSICA KERWIN  
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Claire Forlani isn't one to bottle up her emotions. One moment,
her raucous laugh is ricocheting off the walls in the quiet SoHo
Grand lobby, where the 28-year-old actress sits sipping tea; the
next, her big eyes are welling up with tears.
 &HT;    Only two days ago, Forlani was shooting a film in Vancouver.
Last night she hit a movie premiere and the alarm clock got her out
of bed half an hour ago, at noon.
 &HT;    ``It's been a very surreal few days for me,'' she says.
``Usually I have at least a week once I've finished a film to say
goodbye. I'm on an emotional roller coaster, and I just feel like I
could burst into tears at any moment.''
 &HT;    Fortunately all those feelings will be put to good use when the
next role comes along.
 &HT;    ``You relate to different things at different times in your
life,'' she says seriously, ``and you can give yourself to roles
purely because of what you need to experience or what you have
experienced.''
 &HT;    A second later, Forlani laughs out loud. ``I feel like I'm in a
therapy session,'' she says.
 &HT;    Not a moment too soon, either, to judge by the somber quality of
most of her major roles to date. She was Neal Cassidy's suicidal
girlfriend in ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide,'' the betrayed
girlfriend in ``Basquiat,'' and in ``Meet Joe Black,'' Forlani
hooked up with Death himself, in the form of Brad Pitt.
 &HT;    If those characters showed off her dark side, however, Forlani's
upcoming films will be a good deal sunnier. In ``Boys and Girls,''
she is a bouncy, wide-eyed college babe, and in ``Antitrust,''
slated for a fall release, she plays the techno-thriller's sole
Luddite.
 &HT;    ``My character's the one who puts a plant next to the computer
to absorb the negative energy,'' she explains.
 &HT;    Off-screen, Forlani's relationship with the press has also
seemed a bit gloomy, but she's given her attitude an overhaul as
well.
 &HT;    ``I was really bumming everybody out,'' she says of her
reluctance to publicize herself and her films. ``It was so deeply
depressing to me that I had to do those photo shoots, but you don't
want to not enjoy your day, and you don't want to destroy anyone
else's day. I'm finding ways to be less of a pain in the ass.''
 &HT;    As much as she may despise the pop of flashbulbs, Forlani loves
working her magic on the set.
 &HT;    ``I always ask for more takes,'' she says. ``I'm like a junkie.
Every director allocates me the amount I can have.''
 &HT;    Her addiction to acting began early, when, at age 11, Forlani
enrolled in the Arts Educational School in London. Later she moved
to San Francisco with her parents and then on to Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``It's the same old story,'' Forlani insists. ``It was escapism.
My reality seemed gray, but the second I landed in L.A. _ it sounds
sick and twisted _ but when my feet hit the tarmac, I felt like I
went into Technicolor. My first years there were truly
intoxicating, even when nothing was happening and I was driving
around to pick up scripts in my shitty car. The air intoxicated me.
It's a bizarre feeling and an embarrassing one to admit to.''
 &HT;    It wasn't long before Forlani had bagged the coveted ``Meet Joe
Black'' role, opposite Pitt. Despite a decidedly negative critical
response to the otherworldly romance, Forlani was singled out for
praise.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, following that experience, she took a break from
movie making. ``I checked out,'' she says, looking into her tea.
``My mom was very sick, and I just went to be with her for a year.
No regrets.''
 &HT;    Forlani has been wary of the press since then, it's probably due
in part to a tabloid rumor that she and Pitt were involved in an
on-set romance. Was there anything to it?
 &HT;    ``I've answered the question so many times,'' she sighs,
exasperated. ``Is it still a question?''
 &HT;    With perfect timing, Forlani's 14-year-old goddaughter, Kyra,
who is visiting from England, appears beside her and takes a seat.
 &HT;    ``She's asking the Brad question,'' Forlani says.
 &HT;    ``The answer's no, isn't it?'' Kyra asks.
 &HT;    That's enough to get the actress laughing again. ``Thanks,
Kyra,'' she says. The two are looking forward to a day spent
wandering SoHo's boutiques.
 &HT;    ``Kyra's got the best taste of anyone I know,'' says Forlani,
who insists that she knows nothing about fashion. ``She loves to
shop, and I hate to shop, so Kyra dresses me.''
 &HT;    A few minutes later, the two bounce toward the door. Forlani
looks back over her shoulder.
 &HT;    ``I swear,'' she says, ``Kyra wasn't a ploy!''

 WILD CHILD  
 &HT;    When ``Beverly Hills 90210'' actress Jennie Garth told InStyle
magazine that her favorite fragrance is an obscure scent called
Child that she buys at Fred Segal Apothia in Los Angeles, readers
scrambled for their phones.
 &HT;    The Apothia staff was overwhelmed with calls and owner Ron
Robinson had to hire someone just to handle the inquiries.
 &HT;    In the past four months, he has sold ``nearly six figures''
worth of the obscure indie scent, which he has quietly carried for
the past decade.
 &HT;    Robinson doesn't think Garth's plug had much to do with the
frenzy. After all, celebrity endorsements are commonplace these
days. Rather, it was the fact that Garth said Child drives men
wild.
 &HT;    ``Everyone who calls asks if it really has that effect on men,''
he noted.

 BRITS TEE OFF ON CAMILLA'S COUTURE  
 &HT;    LONDON _ Poor Camilla. Her new look has bombed.
 &HT;    The British press has almost universally attacked the Versace
gown Parker Bowles wore to the gala dinner on June 20 to celebrate
the opening of the new headquarters of Prince Charles' The Prince's
Foundation.
 &HT;    The V-necked, pink gown with diamante swirls was a major fashion
statement by Parker Bowles, who previously has opted for low-key
dresses and suits by such designers as Valentino or Anthony Price.
Her new style included more blonde highlights in her hair and a
touch more makeup than usual.
 &HT;    But Camilla's makeover left fashion critics snarling.
 &HT;    ``So was this a dress too far?'' columnist Lesley Garner wrote
in The Daily Mail.
 &HT;    Garner contended Charles and his advisers were pushing Camilla
into the limelight too fast. Parker Bowles' choice of Versace was,
even unintentionally, identifying her with the late Diana, Princess
of Wales, who regularly wore dresses by the designer. Her dress was
also reminiscent of ones worn by the queen, Garner said, which
``might explain why Charles liked it.''
 &HT;    ``Can't they understand _ whoever they are _ that Camilla in her
normal black dress, or even her hunting jacket, had more integrity,
and thus earned much more sympathy, than this wholly manufactured
creature?''
 &HT;    The Times of London claimed Charles chose the bright-pink color
of the dress but not the design and either paid for the dress
himself or donated its value to one of Donatella Versace's favorite
charities. But whether Versace was the correct choice was clearly a
matter for debate even among Charles' advisers, the Times
indicated.
 &HT;    ``Camilla is never going to fit into the sort of slinky sheath
of the sort you would find on a Versace model,'' one royal source
said. ``She hasn't got a bad figure for a woman of that age. But I
suspect her outfits will hint at the curves instead of highlighting
them.''
 &HT;    The Evening Standard claimed Parker Bowles' choice was simply a
reflection of current society.
 &HT;    ``Donatella Versace dressing Camilla Parker Bowles _ in a frock
chosen by the Prince of Wales _ symbolizes the closing of a great
gulf, between city and county, aspirational chic and assured
frumpishness, youth (in spirit) and age,'' Melanie McDonagh wrote.
``It would be too much to call it a meeting of minds _ intellect
not being the distinguished feature of either set _ but it's
something like social and behavioral cross-dressing.''
 &HT;    But McDonagh went on to bewail the choice of Versace. Friends
and supporters of Parker Bowles have always claimed she's the type
of woman who would gladly leap off a horse and right into a
ballgown. Her appearance, though, left them wondering whether that
were still the case.
 &HT;    ``Camilla used to be the archetype of rural womanhood, if you
exclude the queen, and now the Prince of Wales has gone and spoiled
it,'' McDonagh wrote.

 NAOMI'S MODEL SCENT  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ As a hairstylist, makeup artist, publicist and
photographer hovered expectantly in a 33rd floor suite at the Four
Seasons Hotel on June 14, it was clear that supermodel Naomi
Campbell was in the house.
 &HT;    But as Campbell herself sauntered into the elegantly appointed
sitting room in a girlish cream top and floral pleated skirt, it
definitely wasn't a leave-it-to-diva scene.
 &HT;    Instead, Campbell was upbeat, discussing her eponymous new
fragrance, which is making its American debut at Sephora. Sephora
will have a U.S. store exclusive on the fragrance until September,
and it will retain the Web exclusive indefinitely.
 &HT;    By year-end, the scent is expected to be in about 200 department
store doors, including Macy's and Dillard's.
 &HT;    Campbell signed an agreement with Cosmopolitan Cosmetics _ the
fragrance arm of the German beauty giant Wella _ to produce the
fragrance, which started rolling out last fall and is now available
in several global markets, including Germany, Japan, Australia and
the United Arab Emirates.
 &HT;    Campbell said that the decision to do a fragrance wasn't one she
took lightly.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to just put my name on something, like I did
with the Fashion Cafe,'' said Campbell of the ill-fated New York
theme restaurant she was once a partner in. ``I wanted to be
involved with my fragrance every step of the way, and that meant
committing myself in every way _ to the promotion, to the
formulation of the scent, to everything.''
 &HT;    It's been a successful association thus far: ``The people at
Cosmopolitan are wonderful people to work with,'' Campbell said.
``They're experienced fragrance marketers, and since they also
market the Gucci and Anna Sui fragrances, I'm certainly in great
company.''
 &HT;    Naomi Campbell is slated to be the first in a series of Campbell
fragrances. Campbell, in fact, is ready to go with a second _
Naomagic _ which launches in Germany in September. It doesn't have
a firm U.S. release date yet.
 &HT;    Nor is Campbell limiting herself to fragrance. She plans a full
beauty range, including color cosmetics _ already in the planning
stages _ scented candles, incense and possibly skin care. Whether
they'll be produced by Cosmopolitan has yet to be determined,
although ``they've been so great, I can't imagine going
elsewhere,'' Campbell said.
 &HT;    When asked if she's an aspiring Estee Lauder, Campbell chooses
her words carefully.
 &HT;    ``I admire Estee Lauder a great deal and to reach that level of
success would be incredible. But I'm taking this all one day at a
time. I'm not doing this line because I am being forced to
financially _ instead, I'm doing it because it touches me. It makes
a statement about my sense of smell to the world.''

 VOGUE AND VH1 REUNITE  
 &HT;    This year, suspense is promised. And it's bigger. The second
installment of the ``Vogue/VH1 Fashion Awards'' will take place
Friday, Oct. 20, and has moved from the 69th Regiment Armory to a
venue twice the size at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. It
will be shown live on VH1 and repeated again that night and several
times later in the month.
 &HT;    Richard Beckman, vice president and publisher of Vogue, and Jeff
Gaspin, executive vice president of programming at VH1, said
they're determined to work out the kinks and make the show livelier
than a year ago.
 &HT;    The biggest kink of all last December: Everyone knew the winners
in advance. Although the evening appeared to run smoothly and came
in under two hours, the suspense was missing, as December issues of
Vogue were mistakenly sent out to subscribers early and the winners
were widely reported the day before the event.
 &HT;    This year, three awards will be voted upon online by Vogue
readers and VH1 viewers: designer of the year, most stylish video
and breakthrough video. Seven other categories will be determined
by a style council, composed of designers, models, stylists and
journalists.
 &HT;    Last year, Vogue bought into VH1's annual fusion of rock and
fashion, and the two became 50-50 financial partners in the event.
VH1 will once again reap TV revenues, and Vogue will take the
magazine's revenues from ads surrounding the November awards issue,
which will profile the winners.

 LATIFAH CASTS HER VOTE  
 &HT;    Lane Bryant, whose past spokeswomen have included Camryn
Manheim, Anna Nicole Smith and Mia Tyler, is going the hip-hop
route.
 &HT;    The plus-size retailer, along with election.com, an online
election firm, is joining forces with Queen Latifah, recording
artist and TV host, in a national in-store campaign for fall to
encourage women to register to vote.
 &HT;    The campaign features Latifah in a fake mink vest and leather
jeans. She and Smith will also do the catwalk at the company's
Venezia Jeans fashion show on Sept. 6 in Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``Lane Bryant has some cool stuff, and it's affordable,''
Latifah said. ``I also like their positive outlook. I'm not ashamed
of who I am. And that's what they are all about.''

 (One color slide is available.) 
 By JESSICA KERWIN  
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Claire Forlani isn't one to bottle up her emotions. One moment,
her raucous laugh is ricocheting off the walls in the quiet SoHo
Grand lobby, where the 28-year-old actress sits sipping tea; the
next, her big eyes are welling up with tears.
 &HT;    Only two days ago, Forlani was shooting a film in Vancouver.
Last night she hit a movie premiere and the alarm clock got her out
of bed half an hour ago, at noon.
 &HT;    ``It's been a very surreal few days for me,'' she says.
``Usually I have at least a week once I've finished a film to say
goodbye. I'm on an emotional roller coaster, and I just feel like I
could burst into tears at any moment.''
 &HT;    Fortunately all those feelings will be put to good use when the
next role comes along.
 &HT;    ``You relate to different things at different times in your
life,'' she says seriously, ``and you can give yourself to roles
purely because of what you need to experience or what you have
experienced.''
 &HT;    A second later, Forlani laughs out loud. ``I feel like I'm in a
therapy session,'' she says.
 &HT;    Not a moment too soon, either, to judge by the somber quality of
most of her major roles to date. She was Neal Cassidy's suicidal
girlfriend in ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide,'' the betrayed
girlfriend in ``Basquiat,'' and in ``Meet Joe Black,'' Forlani
hooked up with Death himself, in the form of Brad Pitt.
 &HT;    If those characters showed off her dark side, however, Forlani's
upcoming films will be a good deal sunnier. In ``Boys and Girls,''
she is a bouncy, wide-eyed college babe, and in ``Antitrust,''
slated for a fall release, she plays the techno-thriller's sole
Luddite.
 &HT;    ``My character's the one who puts a plant next to the computer
to absorb the negative energy,'' she explains.
 &HT;    Off-screen, Forlani's relationship with the press has also
seemed a bit gloomy, but she's given her attitude an overhaul as
well.
 &HT;    ``I was really bumming everybody out,'' she says of her
reluctance to publicize herself and her films. ``It was so deeply
depressing to me that I had to do those photo shoots, but you don't
want to not enjoy your day, and you don't want to destroy anyone
else's day. I'm finding ways to be less of a pain in the ass.''
 &HT;    As much as she may despise the pop of flashbulbs, Forlani loves
working her magic on the set.
 &HT;    ``I always ask for more takes,'' she says. ``I'm like a junkie.
Every director allocates me the amount I can have.''
 &HT;    Her addiction to acting began early, when, at age 11, Forlani
enrolled in the Arts Educational School in London. Later she moved
to San Francisco with her parents and then on to Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``It's the same old story,'' Forlani insists. ``It was escapism.
My reality seemed gray, but the second I landed in L.A. _ it sounds
sick and twisted _ but when my feet hit the tarmac, I felt like I
went into Technicolor. My first years there were truly
intoxicating, even when nothing was happening and I was driving
around to pick up scripts in my shitty car. The air intoxicated me.
It's a bizarre feeling and an embarrassing one to admit to.''
 &HT;    It wasn't long before Forlani had bagged the coveted ``Meet Joe
Black'' role, opposite Pitt. Despite a decidedly negative critical
response to the otherworldly romance, Forlani was singled out for
praise.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, following that experience, she took a break from
movie making. ``I checked out,'' she says, looking into her tea.
``My mom was very sick, and I just went to be with her for a year.
No regrets.''
 &HT;    Forlani has been wary of the press since then, it's probably due
in part to a tabloid rumor that she and Pitt were involved in an
on-set romance. Was there anything to it?
 &HT;    ``I've answered the question so many times,'' she sighs,
exasperated. ``Is it still a question?''
 &HT;    With perfect timing, Forlani's 14-year-old goddaughter, Kyra,
who is visiting from England, appears beside her and takes a seat.
 &HT;    ``She's asking the Brad question,'' Forlani says.
 &HT;    ``The answer's no, isn't it?'' Kyra asks.
 &HT;    That's enough to get the actress laughing again. ``Thanks,
Kyra,'' she says. The two are looking forward to a day spent
wandering SoHo's boutiques.
 &HT;    ``Kyra's got the best taste of anyone I know,'' says Forlani,
who insists that she knows nothing about fashion. ``She loves to
shop, and I hate to shop, so Kyra dresses me.''
 &HT;    A few minutes later, the two bounce toward the door. Forlani
looks back over her shoulder.
 &HT;    ``I swear,'' she says, ``Kyra wasn't a ploy!''

 WILD CHILD  
 &HT;    When ``Beverly Hills 90210'' actress Jennie Garth told InStyle
magazine that her favorite fragrance is an obscure scent called
Child that she buys at Fred Segal Apothia in Los Angeles, readers
scrambled for their phones.
 &HT;    The Apothia staff was overwhelmed with calls and owner Ron
Robinson had to hire someone just to handle the inquiries.
 &HT;    In the past four months, he has sold ``nearly six figures''
worth of the obscure indie scent, which he has quietly carried for
the past decade.
 &HT;    Robinson doesn't think Garth's plug had much to do with the
frenzy. After all, celebrity endorsements are commonplace these
days. Rather, it was the fact that Garth said Child drives men
wild.
 &HT;    ``Everyone who calls asks if it really has that effect on men,''
he noted.

 BRITS TEE OFF ON CAMILLA'S COUTURE  
 &HT;    LONDON _ Poor Camilla. Her new look has bombed.
 &HT;    The British press has almost universally attacked the Versace
gown Parker Bowles wore to the gala dinner on June 20 to celebrate
the opening of the new headquarters of Prince Charles' The Prince's
Foundation.
 &HT;    The V-necked, pink gown with diamante swirls was a major fashion
statement by Parker Bowles, who previously has opted for low-key
dresses and suits by such designers as Valentino or Anthony Price.
Her new style included more blonde highlights in her hair and a
touch more makeup than usual.
 &HT;    But Camilla's makeover left fashion critics snarling.
 &HT;    ``So was this a dress too far?'' columnist Lesley Garner wrote
in The Daily Mail.
 &HT;    Garner contended Charles and his advisers were pushing Camilla
into the limelight too fast. Parker Bowles' choice of Versace was,
even unintentionally, identifying her with the late Diana, Princess
of Wales, who regularly wore dresses by the designer. Her dress was
also reminiscent of ones worn by the queen, Garner said, which
``might explain why Charles liked it.''
 &HT;    ``Can't they understand _ whoever they are _ that Camilla in her
normal black dress, or even her hunting jacket, had more integrity,
and thus earned much more sympathy, than this wholly manufactured
creature?''
 &HT;    The Times of London claimed Charles chose the bright-pink color
of the dress but not the design and either paid for the dress
himself or donated its value to one of Donatella Versace's favorite
charities. But whether Versace was the correct choice was clearly a
matter for debate even among Charles' advisers, the Times
indicated.
 &HT;    ``Camilla is never going to fit into the sort of slinky sheath
of the sort you would find on a Versace model,'' one royal source
said. ``She hasn't got a bad figure for a woman of that age. But I
suspect her outfits will hint at the curves instead of highlighting
them.''
 &HT;    The Evening Standard claimed Parker Bowles' choice was simply a
reflection of current society.
 &HT;    ``Donatella Versace dressing Camilla Parker Bowles _ in a frock
chosen by the Prince of Wales _ symbolizes the closing of a great
gulf, between city and county, aspirational chic and assured
frumpishness, youth (in spirit) and age,'' Melanie McDonagh wrote.
``It would be too much to call it a meeting of minds _ intellect
not being the distinguished feature of either set _ but it's
something like social and behavioral cross-dressing.''
 &HT;    But McDonagh went on to bewail the choice of Versace. Friends
and supporters of Parker Bowles have always claimed she's the type
of woman who would gladly leap off a horse and right into a
ballgown. Her appearance, though, left them wondering whether that
were still the case.
 &HT;    ``Camilla used to be the archetype of rural womanhood, if you
exclude the queen, and now the Prince of Wales has gone and spoiled
it,'' McDonagh wrote.
 &HT;    -----
 NAOMI'S MODEL SCENT  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ As a hairstylist, makeup artist, publicist and
photographer hovered expectantly in a 33rd floor suite at the Four
Seasons Hotel on June 14, it was clear that supermodel Naomi
Campbell was in the house.
 &HT;    But as Campbell herself sauntered into the elegantly appointed
sitting room in a girlish cream top and floral pleated skirt, it
definitely wasn't a leave-it-to-diva scene.
 &HT;    Instead, Campbell was upbeat, discussing her eponymous new
fragrance, which is making its American debut at Sephora. Sephora
will have a U.S. store exclusive on the fragrance until September,
and it will retain the Web exclusive indefinitely.
 &HT;    By year-end, the scent is expected to be in about 200 department
store doors, including Macy's and Dillard's.
 &HT;    Campbell signed an agreement with Cosmopolitan Cosmetics _ the
fragrance arm of the German beauty giant Wella _ to produce the
fragrance, which started rolling out last fall and is now available
in several global markets, including Germany, Japan, Australia and
the United Arab Emirates.
 &HT;    Campbell said that the decision to do a fragrance wasn't one she
took lightly.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to just put my name on something, like I did
with the Fashion Cafe,'' said Campbell of the ill-fated New York
theme restaurant she was once a partner in. ``I wanted to be
involved with my fragrance every step of the way, and that meant
committing myself in every way _ to the promotion, to the
formulation of the scent, to everything.''
 &HT;    It's been a successful association thus far: ``The people at
Cosmopolitan are wonderful people to work with,'' Campbell said.
``They're experienced fragrance marketers, and since they also
market the Gucci and Anna Sui fragrances, I'm certainly in great
company.''
 &HT;    Naomi Campbell is slated to be the first in a series of Campbell
fragrances. Campbell, in fact, is ready to go with a second _
Naomagic _ which launches in Germany in September. It doesn't have
a firm U.S. release date yet.
 &HT;    Nor is Campbell limiting herself to fragrance. She plans a full
beauty range, including color cosmetics _ already in the planning
stages _ scented candles, incense and possibly skin care. Whether
they'll be produced by Cosmopolitan has yet to be determined,
although ``they've been so great, I can't imagine going
elsewhere,'' Campbell said.
 &HT;    When asked if she's an aspiring Estee Lauder, Campbell chooses
her words carefully.
 &HT;    ``I admire Estee Lauder a great deal and to reach that level of
success would be incredible. But I'm taking this all one day at a
time. I'm not doing this line because I am being forced to
financially _ instead, I'm doing it because it touches me. It makes
a statement about my sense of smell to the world.''
 &HT;    -----
 VOGUE AND VH1 REUNITE  
 &HT;    This year, suspense is promised. And it's bigger. The second
installment of the ``Vogue/VH1 Fashion Awards'' will take place
Friday, Oct. 20, and has moved from the 69th Regiment Armory to a
venue twice the size at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. It
will be shown live on VH1 and repeated again that night and several
times later in the month.
 &HT;    Richard Beckman, vice president and publisher of Vogue, and Jeff
Gaspin, executive vice president of programming at VH1, said
they're determined to work out the kinks and make the show livelier
than a year ago.
 &HT;    The biggest kink of all last December: Everyone knew the winners
in advance. Although the evening appeared to run smoothly and came
in under two hours, the suspense was missing, as December issues of
Vogue were mistakenly sent out to subscribers early and the winners
were widely reported the day before the event.
 &HT;    This year, three awards will be voted upon online by Vogue
readers and VH1 viewers: designer of the year, most stylish video
and breakthrough video. Seven other categories will be determined
by a style council, composed of designers, models, stylists and
journalists.
 &HT;    Last year, Vogue bought into VH1's annual fusion of rock and
fashion, and the two became 50-50 financial partners in the event.
VH1 will once again reap TV revenues, and Vogue will take the
magazine's revenues from ads surrounding the November awards issue,
which will profile the winners.
 &HT;    -----
 LATIFAH CASTS HER VOTE  
 &HT;    Lane Bryant, whose past spokeswomen have included Camryn
Manheim, Anna Nicole Smith and Mia Tyler, is going the hip-hop
route.
 &HT;    The plus-size retailer, along with election.com, an online
election firm, is joining forces with Queen Latifah, recording
artist and TV host, in a national in-store campaign for fall to
encourage women to register to vote.
 &HT;    The campaign features Latifah in a fake mink vest and leather
jeans. She and Smith will also do the catwalk at the company's
Venezia Jeans fashion show on Sept. 6 in Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``Lane Bryant has some cool stuff, and it's affordable,''
Latifah said. ``I also like their positive outlook. I'm not ashamed
of who I am. And that's what they are all about.''

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

address instead of the symbol, which many computer systems at

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are
departures in September, from $995.
 &HT;     VBT  (P.O. Box 711, Bristol, Vt. 05443; 800-245-3868;
www.vbt.com) does the ``Lake Champlain Valley'' of Vermont for six
days in September and October. This is a biking trip, with an
optional half-day of sea kayaking on Lake Champlain, which lies
between the Adironadacks and the Green Mountains.
 &HT;    There are routes for varying abilities and an itinerary that
includes stops at such towns as East Middlebury. The cost is
$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there
are also trips to Swans Island and Little Cranberry Island. The
cost for the September departures is $1,395.
 &HT;     The Wayfarers  (172 Bellevue Ave., Newport, R.I. 02840;
800-249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com) offers a ``New Mexico: Land of
Enchantment'' trip, a six-day walk based in Taos and Santa Fe.
Walkers go to Abiquiu and the home of painter Georgia O'Keefe,
visit the Taos pueblo and wander through Frjoles Canyon. The cost
is $1,695, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;    The Wayfarers also have a ``Coast of Maine'' trip. Moving up the
coast, by van and by foot, travelers visit Damariscotta Mills and
explore the area around Camden and Rockport. The cost for this
September departure is $1,695.

 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter

 &HT;    Travel bargains come and go. To make the most of these elusive

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are
departures in September, from $995.
 &HT;     VBT  (P.O. Box 711, Bristol, Vt. 05443; 800-245-3868;
www.vbt.com) does the ``Lake Champlain Valley'' of Vermont for six
days in September and October. This is a biking trip, with an
optional half-day of sea kayaking on Lake Champlain, which lies
between the Adironadacks and the Green Mountains.
 &HT;    There are routes for varying abilities and an itinerary that
includes stops at such towns as East Middlebury. The cost is
$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there
are also trips to Swans Island and Little Cranberry Island. The
cost for the September departures is $1,395.
 &HT;     The Wayfarers  (172 Bellevue Ave., Newport, R.I. 02840;
800-249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com) offers a ``New Mexico: Land of
Enchantment'' trip, a six-day walk based in Taos and Santa Fe.
Walkers go to Abiquiu and the home of painter Georgia O'Keefe,
visit the Taos pueblo and wander through Frjoles Canyon. The cost
is $1,695, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;    The Wayfarers also have a ``Coast of Maine'' trip. Moving up the
coast, by van and by foot, travelers visit Damariscotta Mills and
explore the area around Camden and Rockport. The cost for this
September departure is $1,695.

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

address instead of the symbol, which many computer systems at

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are
departures in September, from $995.
 &HT;     VBT  (P.O. Box 711, Bristol, Vt. 05443; 800-245-3868;
www.vbt.com) does the ``Lake Champlain Valley'' of Vermont for six
days in September and October. This is a biking trip, with an
optional half-day of sea kayaking on Lake Champlain, which lies
between the Adironadacks and the Green Mountains.
 &HT;    There are routes for varying abilities and an itinerary that
includes stops at such towns as East Middlebury. The cost is
$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there
are also trips to Swans Island and Little Cranberry Island. The
cost for the September departures is $1,395.
 &HT;     The Wayfarers  (172 Bellevue Ave., Newport, R.I. 02840;
800-249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com) offers a ``New Mexico: Land of
Enchantment'' trip, a six-day walk based in Taos and Santa Fe.
Walkers go to Abiquiu and the home of painter Georgia O'Keefe,
visit the Taos pueblo and wander through Frjoles Canyon. The cost
is $1,695, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;    The Wayfarers also have a ``Coast of Maine'' trip. Moving up the
coast, by van and by foot, travelers visit Damariscotta Mills and
explore the area around Camden and Rockport. The cost for this
September departure is $1,695.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and

&HT;     ACTIVISTS VOW TO FIGHT SCOUTS OVER ANTI-GAY POLICY 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing the Boy
Scouts of America to bar homosexual troop leaders from the
organization will force young men into an impossible predicament,
critics of the ruling say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay youths are put in a Catch-22 situation,'' said Jon
Davidson, supervising attorney in the Los Angeles office of Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``They are told by the Scouts to
be open and honest and, yet, if they are, they are told they will
be kicked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambda is the gay-rights organization that represented James
Dale, the homosexual Scout leader in New Jersey who was removed
from his position in the case before the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells gay youths that if they want to be Scouts, they have
to disobey the requirement to be morally straight,'' Davidson said
of Wednesday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In the case known as Dale vs. Boy Scouts of America, the Supreme
Court decided in a 5-4 ruling that as a private organization, the
Scouts could make their own rules about membership.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not specifically address the matter of young gay
Scouts, some believe the decision could be interpreted as allowing
the Scouts to keep homosexuals out of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy Scout policy says no known or avowed homosexual may be a
member of scouting,'' Davidson said. ``It doesn't distinguish
between leaders or youth members. The decision does not appear to
rest on the fact that James Dale is a scouting leader. It might be
the case that the same result would apply in the exclusion of
someone who is just a member.''
</P>
<P>
   Others belonging to gay rights groups are blasting the decision
and vowing to fight taxpayer funding of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts have basically become the KKK (Ku Klux Klan) of
youth organizations by saying they will not allow some people in
because they are different,'' said Pete King, president of East Bay
Pride in Northern California. ``They can be sure that we will be
out in the cities and in the counties making sure they get no
public assistance ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some maintain that public agencies and government entities who
are tied to the Scouts should wash their hands of any affiliation
with the group. Further, the Scouts could lose public assistance in
cities that adhere to anti-discrimination policies, including San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco already does not allow the Scouts to recruit in
schools or to sponsor them,'' Davidson said. ``But other cities in
California have public agencies . . . that still sponsor troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court accepted their argument that they are a
discriminatory, exclusionary organization. That should present a
serious problem for government entities _ there are fire
departments, military units, public schools that sponsor the
Scouts, that run the troops. They would be participating in
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   While many hailed the ruling because it allows private
organizations to set their own moral course, gay rights supporters
condemn it as a sanction of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for bigotry and discrimination,'' said Scott
Cozza, 47, a social worker at San Francisco General Hospital and a
former scoutmaster, with his son, has formed a protest organization
called Scouting for All. ``Human rights in America has lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's highest court said Wednesday that forcing the
90-year-old scouting organization to accept homosexual troop
leaders would violate the organization's rights of free expression
and free association under the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boy Scouts asserts that homosexual conduct is inconsistent
with the values it seeks to instill,'' Chief Justice William
Rehnquist wrote for the court. To require the Scouts to accept a
gay scoutmaster ``would significantly burden the organization's
right to oppose or disfavor homosexual conduct.''

LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD

Syndicate is for use by NEW AMERICA NEWS SERVICE clients.

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

`PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 1947, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

`PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 1947, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

LATINO ATHLETES GO FOR SUMMER OLYMPIC GOLD

 By VALERIE MENARD 
 &HT;    Four years have passed since the last summer Olympics, and once
more it's time to experience the thrill of victory and agony of
defeat. Fortunately, Hispanic Americans can look forward to plenty
of thrills at this year's games.
 &HT;    The Latino athletes traveling to Sidney, Australia, with Team
USA will likely excel in the sports you would expect _ boxing,
baseball and soccer. They will also participate and excel in events
in which Latinos aren't traditionally as strong, sports such as
canoeing, kayaking and taekwondo.
 &HT;    Broadcast on NBC Sept. 15 - Oct. 1, the summer games will
showcase several Latino athletes favored to take home gold medals.
Leading the pack is diver Mark Ruiz. A native of Puerto Rico, Ruiz
has already been described as the heir apparent to diving great
Greg Louganis. At age 17, Ruiz did not make the Olympic team in
1996, but has since matured _ and so has his diving.
 &HT;    In 1999, Ruiz became the first diver since Louganis to sweep the
U.S. National Diving Championships by finishing in first place in
the one-, three-, and ten-meter platform diving competitions. In
international competition, his best finish was in 1999 when he won
the gold medal in the three-meter event.
 &HT;    Another Latino diver to watch is Rioger ``Rio'' Ramirez, 26.
Ramirez emigrated from Cuba in 1993 and became a U.S. citizen last
year. There may be a glitch, however. Even if he makes the U.S.
team, according to international rules, he will need to get
permission from Cuba to dive for the United States.
 &HT;    Several Latinos are sure to end up on the baseball team, too.
For the first time, the team will not be made up exclusively of
college players, but that doesn't mean Sammy Sosa or Livan
Hernandez will play. The U.S. Olympic baseball team will be made up
of minor leaguers currently playing in major league farm teams. As
yet, no players have been chosen, but Dave Fanucchi of USA Baseball
says that a team made up of top minor-league players debuted at the
Pan Am Games last year and included Latino left-handed pitcher J.
C. Romero. The team lost to Cuba in the gold-medal round. Now a
member of the Minnesota Twins, Romero may decide not to join the
team.
 &HT;    In women's softball, Team USA will again feature veteran players
and members of the gold-medal team from 1996 such as pitcher Lisa
Fernandez. A double-threat, Fernandez, 29, has an earned-run
average as a pitcher _ at the Canada Cup last year she was 3-0 with
40 strikeouts and a 0.00 ERA. Her batting abilities are also
impressive; Fenandez's batting average was .348 at the Canada Cup.
 &HT;    There will also be some newcomers. Shortstop Crystal Bustos, 23,
makes her first appearance in an Olympic competition. She compiled
a batting average of .385 at the U.S. Olympic Cup last year, and
batted .439 at the Pan Am Games. This will be the second year that
softball is an Olympic sport, and Team USA is expected to repeat
its gold medal performance.
 &HT;    The two remaining top sports for Latinos, soccer and boxing,
will again include Latino competitors. In a show of strength,
Soccer USA earned a slot in this year's Olympics _ in which only
two teams per continent can participate _ by beating Guatemala
soundly in April. Look for Ramiro Corrales on the men's team and
Kate Sobrero on the women's team.
 &HT;    The members of this year's U.S. boxing team have been selected
and include two players _ featherweight Ricardo Juarez and
bantamweight Carlos Navarro. Three Latino players made the team in
1996, but none won a medal. Unbeaten in over 60 bouts and a world
champion in 1999, Juarez is a strong favorite. Navarro was a silver
medalist at the Pan Am games and should do well. According to U.S.
boxing team spokesman Kevin Neuemdorf, both players are medal
hopefuls.
 &HT;    Perhaps the most interesting story for Latino athletes in the
Olympics is that they have emerged in several nontraditional
sports. Lisa Arce hopes to make the beach volleyball team, Armando
Ayala is a strong contender for the shooting team. Jeanette Antoifn
may become the first Latina gymnast to earn a medal (Trent Dimas
was the first Latino in 1992), and Angel Perez and Julia Sorzano
may compete in sprint kayaking events.
 &HT;    The most surprising development is the number of Latinos who are
contending for the first taekwondo team to compete as an official
medal sport at the Olympics. A family of Lopezes is listed among
several contenders _ Diana, Steven and Mark. The others are Juan
Moreno, Sabrina Alaquinez, Guillermo Mosquera, Jason Torres and
Peter Lopez. Coached by their brother Jean, all three are strong
medal contenders. Steven leads the pack in the featherweight
division. Flyweight Torres is also favored to win a medal.
 &HT;    Other Latino contenders for Team USA in Sydney are: Celita Shutz
in judo (she also participated in the last summer games); Marcelo
Arrue, Johnathan Bairos, Tinker Judrez and Mariano Friedick in
cycling, Mary Joe Fernandez and Kristina Brandi in tennis,
returning player Gavin Arroyo, Tony Azevedo, Ellen Estes and Brenda
Villa in water polo, and David Zuniga in wrestling. Eric Albarricin
and Michael Santos are in the running to make the wrestling team.
 &HT;    It promises to be fun watching first-time Hispanic American
Olympians and former medalists converging in Sidney as part of Team
USA.
 &HT;    May they all make it to the podium.

 By BILL MAXWELL  
 &HT;    If you are a Pinellas County resident nostalgic for drive-in
theaters, you had better unfold that rumble seat, rinse out that
favorite thermos and truck out to 4990 28th St. North. On June 30,
the St. Petersburg's remaining outdoor movie theater _ the 28th
Street Drive-In _ will not see another moonlit, starry night. Gone,
too, will be those steamy car windows. Remember them?
 &HT;    The 50-year-old theater is shutting down forever.
 &HT;    The land it is on has been sold to the School Board. Citing
stricter zoning laws, high land prices and a shortage of large
tracts of land, Harold Spears, president of the company that owns
the theater, told the St. Petersburg Times that ``it is practically
impossible to build a new drive-in theater today.''
 &HT;    I, like thousands of other Floridians, fondly remember the
drive-in theater. In fact, my family, many of my childhood
acquaintances and I had a love affair with the drive-in. I grew up
in the 1950s and early 1960s as a migrant farm worker. Each year, I
followed my family and others from South Florida to Virginia,
Delaware, New Jersey, upstate New York, Michigan and back to
Florida. We harvested melons, potatoes, tomatoes, beans, apples and
cherries. We rarely stayed in one place longer than two months.
 &HT;    We worked hard, often six days a week, from first light to last.
But at the week's end, everyone _ old men and women, teenagers on
hormones and young children _ knew that a great reward awaited us
down the road or in a neighboring town: the drive-in theater.
 &HT;    Indeed, no matter where we traveled, a drive-in was within
driving distance. As black migrant farm workers, we were always
strangers. Few local blacks wanted us in their part of town and, of
course, no whites wanted anything to do with us. We always lived in
migrant camps or in designated sites out of town.
 &HT;    Rarely were we welcomed in indoor theaters. But drive-ins were
different. Each Saturday or Sunday night, no matter where we were _
Hastings, Fla., Raleigh, N.C., Exmore, Va., Dover, Del., Long
Island, N.Y. _ we found a Sunset or a Starlite or a Sky-Vue or some
other named drive-in.
 &HT;    And we were a sight to behold: dozens of migrants in a caravan
of old pickups and beat-up Buicks, Chevys, Fords and Pontiacs
pulling up to the entrance of a theater. The owners loved our
hard-earned bucks, and we loved the amenities of the outdoor
theater.
 &HT;    The movies, always awful, were a wondrous respite from the daily
toil in the fields, orchards and groves. The cherry Cokes, the hot
dogs and burgers, the candy bars, the popcorn and other treats made
us feel as if we were part of the human race after all.
 &HT;    ``Drive-in night,'' as we called it, was the one time that we
dressed up and put on perfume or cologne. The concession stand gave
us our one real opportunity to mingle with the local residents. At
the stand, the locals seemed to forgive us for being ``dirty
outsiders'' as we forgave them, at least temporarily, for having
snubbed us during the rest of the week.
 &HT;    In a strange way, the drive-in experience gave us dignity. All
week, as we sweated in the hot sun, ate our meals in the fields,
rested under trees or beneath truck beds or wagons, we laughed and
talked about the latest stupid zombie or biker movie we had seen.
 &HT;    The drive-in, always reasonably priced, fortified us like
nothing else could.
 &HT;    Each weekday was one day closer to drive-in night. Even now, I
believe that knowing we were going to the drive-in at week's end
made farm work bearable, at least for the children. The movies also
gave our parents some greatly needed time away from their energetic
offspring. More than a few future fieldhands were conceived on
drive-in night.
 &HT;    So, if you remember drive-ins fondly and want to re-create that
old under-the-sky feeling, time is running out in Pinellas County
and the rest of the country. Short of physically going to a
drive-in, the best ticket these days may be the vicarious
experience found on drive-in Web sites and in books.
 &HT;    Me, I prefer books. The best on the market on this subject are
written by husband-and-wife team Don and Susan Sanders. Published
in 1997, their first such book, ``The American Drive-In Movie
Theatre,'' is a colorful work that covers nearly every aspect of
the industry. Some of the photographs, such as those of lovers
making-out on the front seat of their car or those juicy hot dogs
dripping with mustard, make you go back in time.
 &HT;    Their second book, ``Drive-In Movie Memories,'' is a wonderful
collection of the personal experiences of writers nationwide. A
version of my experiences above is published in Memories.
 &HT;    I say goodbye to the 28th Street Drive-In with a lump in my
throat. This old under-the-star-emporium, like others nationwide,
was a valuable piece of Americana that will not be forgotten.

`PAPAL SIN' OFFERS HOPE FOR GAYS, CATHOLIC CHURCH

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Let's hope that a new book by a highly respected religious and
cultural conservative provides a wake-up call for Roman Catholics
in America, as well as for church officials in the Vatican.
 &HT;    Gary Wills, a devout Catholic, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and
adjunct professor of history at Northwestern University, has just
published ``Papal Sin,'' a blistering attack on the papacy and its
``structures of deceit.''
 &HT;    One does not have to be Catholic _ or gay for that matter _ to
be disgusted, if not infuriated, by the multiple webs of
intellectual dishonesty, distortions of ecclesiastical history,
theological arrogance and papal bullying that Wills exposes with
his no-holds-barred, stinging indictment of the modern papacy.
 &HT;    Wills' book suggests that John Paul II is an intellectual and
spiritual embarrassment, if not disgrace, to Catholics and the
church. His book challenges the pope on church doctrine, including
masturbation, contraception, women in the priesthood, homosexuality
and mandatory celibacy, among other teachings.
 &HT;    I met Mr. Wills recently when I attended a book reading at the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ not far from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology, where I am a lay graduate student in
divinity.
 &HT;    ``Book reading'' is a misnomer. The author did not read from
``Papal Sin.'' Rather, Wills answered a series of questions from
the audience, explaining that he is not angry withor attackingthe
church. After all, Wills says, the church is the people of God.
 &HT;    In fact, Wills enjoys participating in the liturgical life of
the church and still upholds Catholicism's essential creeds and
saving truths, including the Trinity, the Incarnation and the
Resurrection.
 &HT;    I am as convinced that Wills has no quarrel with the people of
God as I am struck by his vigorous disagreements with this pope.
 &HT;    Wills writes: ``The pope alone, we are now asked to accept, is
competent to tell Christian people how to live. No one else can
have any say in the matter _ not a council, not the college of all
bishops, not the national synods of bishops, not the Christian
people. The Holy Spirit now speaks to only one person on earth, the
omnicompetent head of the church, a church that is all head and no
limbs. If that were so, then the body of Christ would be shamefully
reduced.''
 &HT;    During his recent visit to Cambridge, I asked Wills what hope he
saw for the church and someone like me _ an out gay Catholic with a
life partner. The church teaches that gay sex is sinful; therefore,
gay people must remain celibate for life, with no possibility of
intimate, loving, long-term, committed relationships.
 &HT;    I explained to Wills that while he may not be angry with church
officials, I am angered when priests and members of the hierarchy
hurl insults at me and inject misinformation into the public debate
about homosexuality and the gay civil-rights struggle.
 &HT;    I offered one example of insult that came from a Polish priest,
who said recently that ``homosexuals are rich, from rich families''
and they ``do nothing other than travel throughout the world,
flaunting their sickness.''
 &HT;    Closer to home, I offered the example of 16 Catholic bishops in
New England who issued a statement earlier this month slamming the
Vermont state legislature for passing a civil-union law for gay
couples. The law, set to take effect on July 1, grants the legal
benefits of marriage at the state level.
 &HT;    ``Such legislation will undermine cultural and religious respect
for marriage'' wrote the bishops in a statement issued by Bernard
Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston. The statement even accuses the
Vermont legislature of ``prepar(ing) the way for an attack on the
well-being of society itself.''
 &HT;    It also rankles me that few, if any, gay priests _ not an
insignificant number _ speak out against such blatant slander and
insolence. Wills said that today, the priesthood is between 40
percent to 80 percent gay. ``If that's not true, it's trending that
way,'' he added.
 &HT;    Despite Wills' criticism of the papacy, he holds out hope for
the future. To be honest, I don't fully share his optimism. I
don't, for example, hold much hopein the near future for honesty
and truth telling about homosexuality and gay people in the public
sphere _ at least from priests and bishops, let alone officials in
the Vatican.
 &HT;    But Wills' courageous truth-telling does give me hope. Although
he didn't answer my questions directly, his words were inspiring _
just what the Catholic Church needs to hear. ``I credit you, an
open gay Catholic,'' he said.
 &HT;    For this sort of honesty we don't have to wait for a new pope.
``Start telling the truth,'' he added.
 &HT;    Now there's a hopeful call to action.

 By KEVIN BLACKISTONE  
 &HT;    Erick Strickland was a throwback athlete during his high school
days in Bellevue, Neb. Unlike most kids, he didn't just concentrate
on one sport. Unlike most black kids, he included baseball in his
repertoire.
 &HT;    Strickland became a first team All-Nebraska performer in
basketball, football and baseball. He was recruited in each sport
by the most famous college sports programs in the country. The New
York Yankees even offered to make the 6-foot-3-inch, 220-pound
outfielder a first-round draft pick right out of high school if he
would forget about his other athletic interests and focus on
baseball. Strickland decided otherwise.
 &HT;    He accepted a basketball scholarship to Nebraska, where he led
the Cornhuskers to the National Invitation Tournament title in
1996, was named that tournament's MVP and earned a degree in
sociology.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, he was drafted by the Florida Marlins' baseball
organization and spent his summers playing in the Marlins'
minor-league system. Some of his minor-league teammates, such as
Edgar Renteria and Luis Castillo, graduated to the Marlins'
major-league club that won the World Series in 1997.
 &HT;    By then, however, Strickland was playing only basketball.
Despite not being drafted by an NBA team, he made the Dallas
Mavericks' roster. He signed a six-year contract with the team in
August 1997 and hasn't thought about baseball since.
 &HT;    ``My heart wasn't in it,'' Strickland admits.
 &HT;    These days, fewer black kids are picking up bats and balls, and
among those who do, few are holding on to them into high school,
college and the pros.
 &HT;    Last year, the Northeastern University Center for the Study of
Sport in Society reported that the 3 percent participation rate of
black players in major-league baseball was at a 10-year low. The
center also reports that the participation rate of black players in
Division I college baseball is 3 percent, based on 1996-97 figures.
 &HT;    Major-league baseball, which just three years ago patted itself
on the back for having allowed Jackie Robinson to break its color
barrier in 1947, is on the verge of becoming a predominately Latino
sport.
 &HT;    Strickland, 26, says he was lucky to have played baseball at
all. As an Air Force brat who moved around the country, he was
afforded the opportunity that other black kids in urban areas were
not.
 &HT;    ``In the inner city, it's harder to play baseball because you
don't have fields; you don't have places to play,'' Strickland
says. ``Growing up in small towns, growing up in the communities I
did, we had fields and opportunities to play baseball. In the inner
city, kids have basketball courts. It depends on where you live.''
 &HT;    Strickland also admits that he was always more attracted to
sports other than baseball. ``I think in baseball, it doesn't seem
like there's a sense of being involved throughout the whole game,''
he says. ``It seems kind of boring.''
 &HT;    Dennis Poppe, who oversees the college baseball championship
tournament at the NCAA, says the popularity and publicity of
basketball and football has hurt baseball's appeal.
 &HT;    ``I've heard the statement that the slam dunk is more popular,''
Poppe says. ``It could be that.''
 &HT;    Basketball and football certainly are more popular in the
media's eye. On any fall or winter evening, for example, a college
basketball game can be found on television. On any fall or winter
weekend, a college football game can be seen on TV.
 &HT;    The NCAA has a tough time selling baseball to broadcasters,
though, because the games can take three or four hours, and the
threat of cancellation because of weather is always looming, Poppe
says.
 &HT;    Another reason kids of all colors may lean toward football and
basketball is a very practical one: scholarships.
 &HT;    ``We're limited in the numbers of grants-in-aid we give in
baseball compared to other sports,'' Poppe explains.
 &HT;    There are more partial scholarships and fewer free rides
available on the baseball diamond. Kids and parents looking to
sports to finance a college education are more likely to pursue
football and basketball, where the chance of winning a full
scholarship is much greater.
 &HT;    The NCAA is not sitting idly as fewer black kids pursue
baseball. During the College World Series, it holds free clinics,
though not race specific, in the hopes of luring young people to
the diamond.
 &HT;    For several years now, major-league baseball has operated urban
programs specifically to ignite the passion that black kids once
had for the game, as well as to attract new customers for the 21st
century. All in all, though, they are pitches that aren't finding
the mark with black kids.

   BENNINGTON-TRAVEL (Bennington, Vt.) _ Beyond providing an excuse
to indulge in hot dogs and fireworks, the Fourth of July weekend
can still call to mind the struggle around the event the holiday
commemorates, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. So
perhaps a town like Bennington, whose ambience runs from the
workaday to the artsy, should count itself fortunate to have so
visible a reminder of Revolutionary valor. That would be the
Bennington Battle Monument, a limestone shaft that does double
duty, commemorating the Battle of Bennington in 1777 and providing
a perch to which visitors can ascend for impressive views of the
countryside. Reminders of revolutionary glory are only one
diversion in southwestern Vermont, a place rich in recreational
opportunities (the Appalachian Trail runs through the area) and in
its association with famous people, from poets to the kin of

   SUMMER-INDY-FILMS (Hollywood) _ Every summer, as sure as the
snowbirds return from Miami Beach, the major Hollywood studios
unleash their biggest, loudest and most expensive and star-studded
films into a world of vacationing families and entertainment-hungry
teenagers. Tom Cruise hangs from impossible cliffs. Mel Gibson
skewers sneering Brits. Jim Carrey rides the wild highway. The
rules are simple: cars exist to be chased, guns to be fired,
affairs to be consummated, rockets to be launched. Special effects
blossom like wildflowers on the prairie. Have sequel, will travel.
But off to the side, clustered together, are a growing number of
smaller, less heralded movies _ independent features, foreign
language films, this year's quirky Shakespeare adaptations _ that
somehow find themselves battling it out in the nation's theaters
with the big Hollywood quarterbacks. In these movies, cars exist to
be driven, guns to be decried, affairs to be analyzed and rockets?
Well, there are no rockets. Have subtitles, will travel.

&HT;     RESEARCHERS STUDY LINK BETWEEN BRAIN, OBESITY

   SAN ANTONIO _ Scientists at the University of Texas Health
Science Center are a little closer to understanding how the brain
responds to food, devising a way to keep track of how quickly and
how strongly the appetite control center responds after eating.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Research Imaging Center said the technique is
an important step in being able to monitor the brain for a period
of time as it reacts to stimulation or medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't have a strategy to do that kind of experiment
until now,'' said Dr. Peter Fox, a professor of medicine and the
director of the imaging center. ``This is an experimental strategy
that allows us to look at things that happen over the course of
time. Our hope is that it will open up a new kind of
pharmacological research that we haven't had an opportunity to
study before.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by Jia-Hong Gao, an associate professor of radiology
at the health science center, and Yijun Liu, now an assistant
professor at the University of Florida, used functional magnetic
resonance imaging to observe a portion of the brain called the
hypothalamus in 20 subjects who drank sugared water.
</P>
<P>
   They developed a mathematical model, called ``temporal
clustering analysis,'' to plot the course of brain activation as
the glucose was metabolized in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Their report was published Thursday in the letters section of
the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   This work is another step in understanding how the hypothalamus,
the brain region that contains the appetite control center,
functions in lean and obese people.
</P>
<P>
   It's a further refinement of an earlier study by Gao and Liu
that found the hypothalamus turned off more quickly in lean
subjects, sending out signals to stop eating sooner than it did in
obese subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge of this functional MRI study was to map not only
where but also when the brain responds following food ingestion,''
Gao said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are collaborating closely with diabetes experts
in their work. Obesity is a contributing factor to Type 2 diabetes,
in which the body is unable to use insulin to metabolize blood
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Gao and Liu noted that blood insulin levels matched strongly
with brain activity in their experiments. As the blood insulin
level rose, the hypothalamus slowed in lean subjects. The brains of
obese subjects did not respond as effectively to the insulin
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest a relationship between the brain and insulin
that needs further study, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists noted none of their study subjects had diabetes.
The next step in this research, Fox said, will be to study people
who are developing a resistance to insulin and at risk for
developing diabetes.

   NY-TALL-SHIPS (New York) _ An estimated 5 million spectators are
expected to throng New York City's shores next week for what may be
the greatest nautical spectacle of all time _ an event drawing well
over 120 tall ships, some 42 warships from the United States and 25
other nations and 50,000 to 70,000 small pleasure craft. By Ralph

   CHARDIN-RETROSPECTIVE (New York) _ According to the glacial
timetable on which big exhibitions at art museums operate these
days, it hasn't been especially long, 21 years, since the last
major traveling retrospective of the 18th-century French painter
Jean-Simeon Chardin. A new one arrives at the Met looking much less

   NY-DAHESH-MUSEUM (New York) _ One of the virtues of the small

<P>
   BENNINGTON-TRAVEL (Bennington, Vt.) _ Beyond providing an excuse
to indulge in hot dogs and fireworks, the Fourth of July weekend
can still call to mind the struggle around the event the holiday
commemorates, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. So
perhaps a town like Bennington, whose ambience runs from the
workaday to the artsy, should count itself fortunate to have so
visible a reminder of Revolutionary valor. That would be the
Bennington Battle Monument, a limestone shaft that does double
duty, commemorating the Battle of Bennington in 1777 and providing
a perch to which visitors can ascend for impressive views of the
countryside. Reminders of revolutionary glory are only one
diversion in southwestern Vermont, a place rich in recreational
opportunities (the Appalachian Trail runs through the area) and in
its association with famous people, from poets to the kin of
presidents. By Gustav Niebuhr.

   SUMMER-INDY-FILMS (Hollywood) _ Every summer, as sure as the
snowbirds return from Miami Beach, the major Hollywood studios
unleash their biggest, loudest and most expensive and star-studded
films into a world of vacationing families and entertainment-hungry
teenagers. Tom Cruise hangs from impossible cliffs. Mel Gibson
skewers sneering Brits. Jim Carrey rides the wild highway. The
rules are simple: cars exist to be chased, guns to be fired,
affairs to be consummated, rockets to be launched. Special effects
blossom like wildflowers on the prairie. Have sequel, will travel.
But off to the side, clustered together, are a growing number of
smaller, less heralded movies _ independent features, foreign
language films, this year's quirky Shakespeare adaptations _ that
somehow find themselves battling it out in the nation's theaters
with the big Hollywood quarterbacks. In these movies, cars exist to
be driven, guns to be decried, affairs to be analyzed and rockets?
Well, there are no rockets. Have subtitles, will travel.

   This story, for Thursday papers, was filed Tuesday evening:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-PAPER (Akron, Ohio) _ In New York in 1994, Carl Chancellor
and Bob Dyer looked like tourists, snapping pictures at the Statue
of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy restaurant, clinking
beer bottles and wineglasses in heady toasts back at their hotel.
More than tourists, they were colleagues out on the town
celebrating. Chancellor and Dyer were part of a team of reporters
for The Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes
of this city of 215,000 people. Their series earned the paper
journalism's big award, the Pulitzer Prize. In Akron, there were
congratulatory speeches for a staff that had united behind the
series and gloried in having been a healing force in the city. The
Beacon Journal also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the
series ended, it introduced a lineup of columnists reflecting ``the
perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman
and a white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer,
who is white. The paper, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment. Which made it all the more startling when,
just a year later, the jubilation began to fade _ for the men and
the newsroom. Troubled by the state of race relations, The Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in. Many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown less progress. By Dana Canedy. (6240

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Find compromise on drug benefit plans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should a 65-year-old Bill Gates only be required to pay $25 a
month for prescription drug insurance? Should drug costs for senior
citizens be left to the profit motives of the insurance and drug
industries?
</P>
<P>
   This is an election year, and with seniors making up a quarter
of probable voters, the debate on providing prescription-drug
insurance for the nation's 39 million Medicare recipients has
become a political show with little hope of reaching a bipartisan
settlement. During debate in the U.S. House of Representatives on
the issue, Democrats walked out and the Republicans sang songs at
the mike.
</P>
<P>
   Election-year politics and the influence of big money have
resulted in a Democratic plan that costs too much and a Republican
plan that would mostly benefit the pharmaceutical industry.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP approach, with a $40 billion price tag over five years,
would offer financial incentives to private insurers in hopes of
enticing them to offer drug insurance to Medicare recipients.
However, White House health policy analyst Chris Jennings says the
incentives would encourage insurers to bilk the government for more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association
of America, concurs with Jennings. Few private insurers would offer
such drug policies, Kahn says, since the seniors most likely to
sign up for the benefit are those in need of a regimen of expensive
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan has a $250 deductible, would cost an estimated $37
a month, and would pay half of a person's annual drug costs up to
$2,100. Any additional costs would then be borne by the patient.
However, the GOP plan would pay 100 percent of any cost above
$6,000.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to trump the GOP benefits, Democrats proposed a
program costing $100 billion over five years. Seniors would pay $25
a month for protection offered through Medicare, with no
deductible, and no one would pay more than $4,000 annually for
prescription drugs. To top it off, President Clinton wants the
program to roll in 2002, a year earlier than the GOP proposes.
</P>
<P>
   While the price tag of the Democratic approach is troubling, its
basic structure is clearly superior to that offered by the
Republicans. Its main advantage lies in running the program through
the existing Medicare system, instead of relying on private
insurance companies to decide whether or not they'll even offer the
coverage. Under that system, Medicare would also have the market
power needed to force pharmaceutical companies to lower the prices
they're charging for prescription medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that has inspired a vicious and well-funded
response from the pharmaceutical lobby, which is paying for
television ads critical of several Democrats who co-sponsored a
bill to require discounts on drug sales to Medicare recipients. The
industry coalition, ``Citizens for Better Medical Care,'' is
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on negative TV ads in the
home states of the bill's co-sponsors, claiming the representatives
favor ``government-controlled prescription medications.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have a chance to shape the debate as the election
rolls around. A drug benefit for Medicare recipients is needed. It
should be voluntary and cost-efficient, which can only happen with
Medicare negotiating reasonable discounts with drug companies and
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   And in the name of fairness, even with today's budget surpluses,
we ought to remember that our children still face the depletion of
Medicare and Social Security trust funds within 30 years. There are
twice as many young families as seniors in poverty today,
especially single mothers with children. Millions of them lack any
health insurance whatsoever. Any new health benefit should be
balanced with the situation of truly needy Americans in mind,
whether young or old.

STARS AND HIGH-TECH CAN'T BAIL OUT WATERLOGGED `STORM'

 Our Grade: C  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The film version of Sebastian Junger's best seller, ``The
Perfect Storm,'' should have been the perfect summer adventure.
Alas, it's turned out to be considerably less than that _ not
terrible, but distinctly disappointing, not nearly as engaging or
thrilling as its premise seems to promise.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it has everything going for it. A top-notch cast, a
respected screenwriter, a director who's already proved his mettle
with a classic seagoing adventure (``Das Boot'') and tens of
millions of dollars worth of computer-generated and other special
visual effects bent on creating the ultimate in movie bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, however, none of these virtues pans out: The
performances are ponderous, Bill Wittliff's script is weak and
cliched, Wolfgang Petersen's direction is uncharacteristically
heavy-handed and the various computer-generated portions of the
storm look so artificial that it's hard to suspend disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book is, of course, a slightly fictionalized account of
a true 1961 story about a Gloucester, Mass., swordfishing boat
caught in the grip of a giant storm in the North Atlantic created
by the collision of three raging weather fronts _ a storm Warner
Bros.' publicity department claims is ``the fiercest in modern
history.''
</P>
<P>
   This film version opens very slowly, with a tedious, pre-storm
prologue which introduces the not-especially-interesting crew
members of the ill-fated Andrea Gail _ a sequence which is so long
(45 minutes), overblown with James Horner's brassy score and filled
with portentous dialogue that they could well be astronauts
departing on a one-way mission to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Then the daddy of all storms finally hits, and the rest of the
movie is a blur of flying water, rolling waves the size of Idaho,
and an ultra-macho, bearded George Clooney steering his little boat
in the big, angry sea with a goofy smile on his face and laughing _
yes, laughing _ in the face of certain death.
</P>
<P>
   It should be the white-knuckle ride of all time, but, boy, is it
not:
</P>
<P>
   _The characters are unappealing and the storytelling is so
sloppy we never quite know (or care) what any particular one of
them is doing at any time as part of the group survival effort.
</P>
<P>
   _The narrative keeps cross-cutting to other characters caught in
the storm _ yachties, Coast Guardsmen _ which is pretty much dead
time because we don't know them and have absolutely no emotional
investment in their survival.
</P>
<P>
   _The script keeps taking us back to the Gloucester Home Front,
where Diane Lane (for some reason, the only character in the movie
with a thick Massachusetts accent) overacts her grief to the point
that we start looking for the hook.
</P>
<P>
   But, for me, the largest of the film's many problems are its
computer-generated effects. The recreation of a reasonably
realistic tempest may represent an advance in the science of
CGI-animation, but the key word here is ``reasonably.'' In fact,
the animated portions of the storm never look quite real.
</P>
<P>
   Stood up against the storm sequences in John Ford's 1937 ``The
Hurricane,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1942 ``Reap the Wild Wind'' or even
Carol Reed's 1962 ``Mutiny On the Bounty'' _ this one pales in
believability. The digital technology that Hollywood is betting its
future on may be getting better all the time, but it still has a
long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Perfect Storm. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen. Screenplay by
Bill Wittliff. Cast: George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Diane Lane,
John C. Reilly, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Warner Bros. 132
minutes. Rated PG-13 for natural violence.

JORDAN FILM UNUSUAL CHOICE FOR LARGE-FORMAT IMAX THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Fort Worth Museum of Science and
History's IMAX screen is usually reserved for the educational. You
go there to see films about butterflies and dolphins, earthquakes
and volcanoes. You don't go there expecting to celebrate sports
heroes to a jock-jams pop music beat.
</P>
<P>
   So the museum's newest IMAX film, ``Michael Jordan to the Max''
_ added to a film rotation that includes ``Dolphins'' and ``T-Rex:
Back to the Cretaceous'' _ is an unusual choice. But the 45-minute
portrait of the basketball superstar is also a good choice. Though
not specifically educational, the film is inspiring, entertaining
and ideal for summer viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Jordan through the final games of his
basketball career _ the 1998 NBA playoffs, where he led the Chicago
Bulls to the team's sixth championship. It also offers a glimpse of
Jordan's early days, his short-lived baseball career and his impact
in the basketball world.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's impact, of course, goes beyond the basketball world _
and that's the film's main message. ``Michael Jordan to the Max''
is the first IMAX film to feature an individual. Usually the
large-format films are dedicated to large-format subjects _
mountains, oceans, rain forests. But if there's anyone the
larger-than-life portrayal fits, it's Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson, Jordan's coach when he played for the Bulls, calls
him ``a real-life hero.'' This film, which debuted worldwide in
May, shows the talent, determination, work ethic and dignity that
made the class-act Jordan the athlete of the century.

THE MILLENNIUM ARRIVES IN THE HARBOR BY SAIL AND STEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The transportation and logistics battalions began
arriving several months ago. Sailors have been brought from as far
away as the Middle East. Dozens of American warships are preparing
to take position in line with several aircraft carriers, destroyers
and cruisers from across the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Battle stations, New York. OpSail is coming.
</P>
<P>
   In what the planners say will be the biggest maritime operation
in history, more than 300 military ships from nations across the
world will be sailing into the waterways around New York City for
the millennium's July 4th.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of tall ships, review of military vessels and a
fireworks display will close out a series of events in a big show
beginning this weekend that will include concerts, receptions and
tours of ships.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there were so many military ships in New York
Harbor, naval officers joked, the British were about to invade.
</P>
<P>
   But managing the logistics and security is no joke. Officials
from the Navy, Coast Guard, Secret Service and the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey have long been preparing for visits from
300 ships participating in the events, somewhere between 40,000 and
70,000 private boats carrying spectators, more than 12,000 military
personnel, more than 5,200 invited guests, hundreds of Secret
Service agents and the president of the United States in an area
that appears _ to the nonboater _ to be without traffic lights,
marked lanes or enforceable speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Son, it is going to be crazy,'' said one naval officer, who
did not want his name used because, of course, the official
military line is: ``It's all under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate responsibility for the operation, which was ordered by
Congress as a millennium celebration, falls to Rear Adm. John B.
Padgett III, the commander of the Navy's Northeast Region, and Rear
Adm. H.G. Ulrich III, the commander of Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12.
But more than 1,500 people have been working for months to pull
together the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In February the Navy and Coast Guard began bringing in security
workers, housing them in New York City hotels. Early this month,
they moved them to a command center at Pier 94 near West 54th
Street, where they have been elbow-to-elbow with the Secret
Service, the Port Authority, other government agencies and the
``force protection'' units, which will be responsible for escorting
ferries carrying invited guests and enforcing the normal water
traffic laws, monitoring everything from litter to speed.
</P>
<P>
   There will even be space for the judge advocate general's
office, in the event that someone in the military needs to be
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been working on planning this thing for almost two
years,'' said Chief Petty Officer William Messing, who is helping
coordinate the transportation and logistics for the events,
officially called International Naval Review 2000 and OpSail 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Navy and Coast Guard personnel will help enforce special
regulations: Pleasure craft cannot travel faster than 10 knots
(about 8 miles per hour); no seaplanes over the Hudson; boats must
stay away from the staging area on Governors Island, the command
center for the anti-terrorism forces.
</P>
<P>
   And there is to be nothing but water within 500 yards of the USS
Hue City, a guided-missile cruiser that will have President Clinton
aboard while he reviews the parade of ships.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Congress passed an enabling act to allow warships
of other countries to enter domestic U.S. waters was in 1890, when
President Benjamin Harrison was authorized to invite foreign
warships to a naval review in New York Harbor to commemorate the
400th anniversary of Columbus' landing in 1892. (The review was
held in 1893 because it took three years to plan the event.)
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed a similar enabling act in October 1996 to
commemorate the millennium, and this time, warships from 43 nations
are coming. The American contingent during the review will include
14 government ships _ one from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, three from the Coast Guard and 10 from the Navy _
and the Marine Corps is providing land-sea amphibious assault
vehicles for demonstrations around the city.
</P>
<P>
   At about 8 a.m. on July 4, the president, on the Hue City, will
pass the anchored warships lining the harbor and the river to the
George Washington Bridge. The review will be followed at 9:45 by a
parade of about 300 tall ships. In the evening, after the ships
have finished moving up the Hudson, 60,000 fireworks will be fired
from 13 barges anchored at five locations in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The command center team at Pier 94 will be watching over all
that, as well as helping coordinate some side shows, including the
movements of New York Fire Department's three tugs, which will be
spouting arching lines of red, white and blue water.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult tasks, according to those involved,
has been amassing the resources to transport guests from shore to
three Navy ships _ 2,500 to the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy;
1,700 to the amphibious assault ship Nassau, a carrier-like craft
for helicopters; and 1,000 to the destroyer Mount Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   To get VIPs from the shore to the ships, the organizers turned
to NY Waterway, which normally ferries 32,000 commuters to and from
New York City each day.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Arthur Imperatore Jr., the president of NY
Waterway, has been directing construction of landing barges that
will nestle against ships and docks that are too high or two low
for ferry boarding.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the events, the Secret Service will conduct
security sweeps of the barges, ferries and docks to be used by the
guests (some of the facilities were rebuilt for the occasion).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest naval review of all time, and they want
things to go without a hitch,'' Kenneth Favara, a construction
superintendent at NY Waterway, said as he and Messing reviewed the
construction of two barges in a Weehawken, N.J., shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Favara has worked on projects for the city before, like building
barges for an emergency evacuation of Rikers Island. But after
talking to a supervising Secret Service agent, he realized that he
had done nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a guy who is doing a plumbing job next week over
there,'' he said, pointing to a Manhattan pier. Then he added with
a playful smile: ``But the Secret Service lady told me that I might
want to hold off on that, unless I want my guy to be starring down
the barrel of a couple of AK-47s.''

 &HT;    Rocky and Bullwinkle' delivers fun, puns
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Our tender heroine's name is Karen Sympathy.
Get it? Care and sympathy. And our hero was a star ``quarterbuck''
at Wossamotta U. He's a moose. Now do you get it?
</P>
<P>
   These are among the truckload of outrageous and delightful puns
in the long-awaited spectacular that has all Hollywood abuzz _
``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the anticipation hasn't been that great, even among aging
fans of the old TV cartoon series that featured plucky Rocky J.
Squirrel and bumbly Bullwinkle J. Moose. But after another summer
of gross-out movies, are we ever glad this animated/live-action
film has come along. It may be a trifle, but it's gentle fun. While
not fall-off-the-chair hilarious, it has enough satire, wordplay
and pop cultural references to amuse the adults, and enough cartoon
schtick to please the kids.
</P>
<P>
   And did we mention the human stars are Robert De Niro, Rene
Russo, Jason Alexander and Randy Quaid, with cameos by Jonathan
Winters and Carl Reiner? Nothing trifling about that roster.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Des McAnuff, a Broadway veteran whose first film
was an adaptation of Honore Balzac's novel ``Cousin Bette.'' From
Balzac to Bullwinkle? Why not? In its way, this film is just as
much a comedy of contemporary manners. It's also a kind of ``road
movie,'' a la Hope and Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   After some clever shenanigans that bring Rocky and Bullwinkle
out of retirement into real life, the pair once again must battle
the evil Fearless Leader (De Niro). He plans to take over the world
through his RBTV network based in Rockefeller Center _ Really Bad
Television. (Got that, NBC?) His feckless, heavily accented
henchmen from Pottsylvania are Boris Badenov (Alexander) and
Natasha Fatale (Russo).
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle's comrade-in-antlers is an FBI agent (a
likable Piper Perabo, who debuted in ``White Boys''). The good guys
are sweet, but they're nearly as incompetent as the baddies who
chase them across the country by chopper and Cheapo-Rent-A-Car.
Rocky, the Flying Squirrel, can't get airborne anymore. Bullwinkle
is as confused as ever. And agent Karen Sympathy may be just too
nice for the job, as she struggles with her inner child.
</P>
<P>
   The action is cartoon-frenetic, but the violence is
cartoon-friendly. And there's a seamless melding of animation,
computerization and live action, with emphasis on the latter.
(Roger Rabbit set the standard.)
</P>
<P>
   The actors have a fine time hamming it up. Co-producer De Niro,
sporting a wicked scar, appears as if he might laugh at himself at
any moment, especially when he breaks into his ``Taxi Driver''
routine: ``Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me?''
Alexander and Russo make a good comedy team, with impeccable timing
and amusing little gestures, not to mention his abbreviated
moustache and her purple lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rocky and Bullwinkle, well, the Cold War may be over, but
America still needs them. So do adults looking for a flick they can
enjoy with their kids. The humor is broad, and the rule-the-world
plot familiar, but the film is still pun-derful.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE KEHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEING AN INDIE IN CHINA IS HARD
</P>
<P>
   One name stands out on the credits of ``Shower,'' a gentle
Chinese comedy that opens next week in New York. Among the Chinese
personnel _ the director Zhang Yang, the cinematographer Zhang
Jian, and Pu Cun Xin, a popular theater actor starring as a
prodigal son who comes home to run his father's outmoded
neighborhood bathhouse in Beijing _ there is the conspicuously
occidental moniker of the producer, Peter Loehr.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Loehr, 33, is the founder of Imar Film Co.
Ltd. It is the first truly independent film company in China, where
production has been channeled through state-owned studios.
</P>
<P>
   Long fascinated by Asia, Loehr moved after law school to Japan,
where he found a job working for a large Japanese entertainment
firm. ``I had been traveling to China for a long time,'' Loehr said
on a recent visit to New York, ``when I rather naively decided that
it might be a good idea to go to Beijing and make independent
films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two years to get the company incorporated, because no
one had ever done this before. There was no precedent for me to
follow, so it was a very big struggle to get the company up and
running and legal. It was a very long process, so obviously I had a
lot of time to read scripts and a lot of time to meet with people
and learn about the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhang Yang had a script that I thought was really, really
special. We got to know each other, and that lead to our first
feature, `Spicy Love Soup.''' The movie became the second highest
grossing film in China in 1998, right behind ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought that the Chinese audience comes first,''
said Loehr. ``We do have something to say about China and about
Chinese society. `Shower' is our third film, and we've just
finished our fourth, a violent road movie that takes place along
the Vietnam border.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the movies that have come out of China in recent
years, ``Shower'' was not originally designed for export. But when
it became a hit on the festival circuit, Sony Classics acquired it
for U.S. distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started,'' Loehr said, ``we wanted to lay down some
guidelines for ourselves: that we would make modern, urban films
for the Chinese audience, that we would work with first-time
directors and that we would try to do things differently than the
way they were being done, because nothing was working. We had to
find a way to compete with the U.S. blockbusters that were coming
in, because the market for Chinese films was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't really barriers to foreigners, though at the
beginning, we did play it very low-key,'' continued Loehr, who used
the Chinese transliteration of his name in the initial publicity.
``The barrier is really that an entirely new system has to be
created. We couldn't find a national distributor, so we had to find
a way to market and distribute our films ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For Loehr, that has meant making dozens of individual deals with
local exhibitors. In less populous regions like Mongolia, he sells
prints of his films on a cash basis, just as the pioneer producers
did. ``Playing percentage deals in bigger cities means having
agents on site to count the number of admissions,'' Loehr said,
``to make certain that the theater owner isn't underreporting the
gross.''
</P>
<P>
   Because state-financed Chinese films are always given glowing
reviews in the press, Loehr has found that the occasional negative
notice actually works in his favor. ``A bad review makes people
curious, because they've never seen one before.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSY HOLLY HUNTER
</P>
<P>
   ``I got offered opportunities last year that I couldn't turn
down,'' said Holly Hunter, by way of accounting for her
near-ubiquity this season. The Oscar-winning actress (for ``The
Piano'') can currently be seen starring in the Showtime feature
``Harlan County War'' and in supporting appearances in ``Jesus'
Son'' and ``Time Code.'' Coming up are roles in Rodrigo Garcia's
``Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her'' and Joel and Ethan
Coen's ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' And she can also be heard,
but not seen, in the Coens' 1984 ``Blood Simple,'' which is being
rereleased on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Her role as a repressed recovering alcoholic in ``Jesus' Son''
came about when Hunter was appearing in New York in the play
``Impossible Marriage'' and saw a fellow cast member reading a
screenplay. ``I looked at the cover page and saw it was by Denis
Johnson, one of my favorite writers, period. So I read it that
night and I called the production office in Philadelphia the next
day and said, `I'd like to be in the movie.' And they said, `Hold
on, we'll let you talk to a producer.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the privileges that I have, of being able to help
smaller projects a little bit. It gave this project a little
nudge.''
</P>
<P>
   ADIEU TO MIRIMAX
</P>
<P>
   Miramax, the Manhattan-based production and distribution
company, has seen some significant executive turnover in the last
few weeks. Jason Blum and Amy Israel, both senior vice presidents
for acquisitions and co-productions for the company, a Disney-owned
mini-major, have left to form their own firm, Blum Israel
Productions.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, based in Los Angeles, has five features and two
television shows in active development. (``We promise they'll be
good,'' Blum said by telephone.) It has set up a nonexclusive,
two-year ``first look'' deal with Miramax, which means that Blum
and Israel will be pitching their projects first to their former
employers, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, co-chairmen of Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   Also departing is Cynthia Swartz, who has been with the
company's publicity department for 10 years, most recently as the
executive vice president in charge of special projects. Swartz has
been coordinating the studio's dauntingly efficient Oscar campaigns
for the last several years, racking up 122 nominations and 36 wins
for Miramax films, including best picture awards for ``The English
Patient'' and ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   In September she will become a senior vice president for
publicity at Columbia Pictures, directing the New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Weinstein said: ``We loved working with Cynthia and wish
her nothing but success. With Jason and Amy we've given birth to
producers whose first-look deal will keep them part of the Miramax
family.''

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT MIFFED OVER CBS REPORT OF INCREASED CRIME IN BRITAIN
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDN _ A report on CBS News that crime in Britain has grown
worse than it is in the United States, has come under attack from
government and tourism officials here worried that fearful
Americans may take their vacation dollars elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which aired Tuesday evening, depicted Britain as
``one of the most violent urban societies in the Western world, a
place where a person's chances of being assaulted, burgled and
robbed are substantially greater than in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, the veteran news anchor, introduced the story by
noting that it represents a substantial departure from conventional
images of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, thousands of Americans will travel to Britain,
expecting a civilized island free from crime and ugliness and, in
many ways, it is that,'' Rather said. ``But now, like the U.S., the
UK has a crime problem and, believe it or not, except for murder,
theirs is worse than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS reporter Tom Fenton cited an unpublished government report
that says violent crime has jumped 19 percent this year compared to
last year. Robberies in London have increased nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the story, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government moved
quickly to counter the report without denying the substance of it.
With national elections expected next year, the rising crime rate
is emerging as a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office _ similar to the U.S. Attorney General _ issued
a statement saying the CBS report was ``simplistic'' and based on
flawed comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   The British government also went on the offensive, noting that
the murder rate in Britain is 1.43 per 100,000 residents compared
with 6.26 in the United States. The rate for London is 2.09 per
100,000 population, compared to 8.6 in New York and 49.15 in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American is seven times more likely to be murdered
than a British citizen, and 60 times more likely to be shot dead,''
the Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS report acknowledged that Britain still has one of the
lowest murder rates in Europe, but it noted that gun violence was
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Handguns are still banned from Britain and very few police
officers are armed. ``This year there have already been hundreds of
shootings in British cities, dozens in London alone _ three of them
in one evening recently,'' Fenton reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the British Tourist Office expressed alarm over
the CBS report's description of British streets and shopping malls
as a ``battleground.'' About 4 million Americans visit Britain each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that prospective visitors will not be deterred by
these sensationalist stories,'' the tourist office said.
</P>
<P>
   The government refuses to discuss the report upon which the CBS
story was based until it is made public, probably next month. The
report was leaked to the Times of London, which published details
on Sunday, however.
</P>
<P>
   But Home Secretary Jack Straw acknowledged in a recent TV
interview that crime was rising. Straw blamed much of the increase
on drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a general problem of drink-related violence in our
society, particularly amongst younger men, which we have got to
deal with,'' he said. ``It's one of the reasons why the violent
crime figures are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Widdecombe, Straw's counterpart in the Conservative Party,
accused Blair's Labor Party of being soft on crime. ``I think there
are very obvious causes, first of all the huge drop in police,''
she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policemen and particularly constables have dropped by about
2,600 since this government came to power.''

TRAVEL WRITER'S DISAPPEARANCE SCARY BUT NOT THE NORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The disappearance (and possible murder) of a U.S. tourist abroad
is extremely rare; in most popular tourist destinations, you're
probably as safe as you are at home, or safer. But for those of us
who travel abroad, especially alone, the story of Claudia
Kirschhoch ought to be a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschhoch, a New York travel journalist described as an
experienced traveler, went missing in late May while on assignment
in Jamaica. She had been staying at a popular and well-known resort
with acquaintances but intended to spend the last few days of her
trip on her own. By the time friends and family realized she had
not made her return flight to the United States, she had not been
seen for several days. As of last week, she was still missing after
more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Her disappearance is by far the exception, not the rule. During
the yearlong period ending Sept. 30, 1998, the Bureau of Consular
Affairs of the U.S. State Department investigated about 5,500 cases
of missing U.S. citizens abroad. The vast majority were located
without incident, a bureau spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   So, I bring up her case not as a scare tactic but as a reminder:
In a world that has grown so small, in which we've become so
accustomed to foreign travel that it seems like nothing to step on
an airplane in the morning and to be eating lunch in another
country that afternoon, it's sometimes easy to forget that when you
leave the United States, you also leave its laws and culture. And
at times, that makes it easy to overestimate your safety _ and
forget the common-sense precautions every traveler should take.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you finally get to where you're going, you want to have
this place as your oasis from work or whatever you're escaping, and
you don't want to think something could go wrong,'' says Kristina
Rundquist, a spokeswoman for the American Society of Travel Agents.
``I think it's easy to kind of shut down your defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   I am as guilty of that as anyone. I like to go off on my own,
renting a car or walking or taking a local bus rather than joining
an organized tour group. Though I always leave an itinerary for
friends and family, there are sometimes days when no one knows
exactly where I am; I rarely think to leave word of my day's plans
with the hotel staff or check in with anyone daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're traveling, you don't get a free pass,''
says Amy Hunter, publicity director at Lonely Planet, a guidebook
publisher. ``You don't want to become so paranoid that you miss out
on the things you went to see, but you're not immune to the kinds
of things that can happen anywhere. And if you're in some
less-established areas, you have to think about the kinds of things
that could get you into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Rundquist says, safe travel should start before you
ever leave the country. If you're going abroad, even to a popular
area like Mexico, a Caribbean island or Europe, you should check
with your travel agent or the federal government to see if there
are travel warnings about your destination, she says.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department publishes three types of travel documents
regarding foreign travel. First, there is a consular information
sheet published for every recognized foreign nation. These
documents list basic information about the country, including its
political, economic and legal system, driving regulations, and any
basic security information, such as high-crime areas or unusual
laws that might pertain to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The department also publishes public announcements pertaining to
specific events or situations during a limited duration. For
instance, a public announcement would warn travelers when roads are
washed out after a flood or that demonstrations are likely because
of an upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the department issues travel warnings for countries
that it urges Americans not to visit. These are typically strongly
worded documents listing problems such as civil war, terrorist
attacks or frequent kidnappings of tourists. Last week, there were
29 countries on that list, including Albania, Fiji, Nigeria and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Even if going to a destination generally regarded to be safe,
there are a few precautions every traveler should take. Leave an
itinerary, complete with passport number, flight information, and
phone numbers for hotels and tour companies, with at least one
person at home. Take one with you as well.
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're going to be gone for more than a week, set
up a system for keeping in touch with someone at home. You don't
have to make an expensive overseas phone call; you can just arrange
to send an e-mail or leave a message in a voice-mail box, says
Hunter of Lonely Planet.
</P>
<P>
   And when you're at your destination, relax but don't forget that
you are in unfamiliar surroundings, and don't lose sight of common
sense. Leave expensive jewelry or watches in the hotel safe (or
better yet, at home) and don't flash wads of cash or traveler's
checks. Book tours through your hotel or an established tour
agency, says Shirley Smith, a travel agent with Dan Dipert Tours in
Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If you're traveling alone, try to hook up with groups of other
travelers when exploring, and ask for their advice about safe
areas. If you are driving, get clearly written directions, plus
helpful phrases such as ``Where is'' in the language of the country
you're in. Always carry a phrase book if you don't speak the
language.
</P>
<P>
   I also always try to carry something with the name and address
of my hotel. (Rundquist recommends a matchbook, as they're highly
portable.) This way, if I get wildly lost, as I've been known to
do, it's easy for passers-by to set me on my way. I watch what
other people are doing _ if there are no women in a restaurant or
club, I don't go in. And I pay attention to the locals _ if
children and families are walking around a neighborhood or plaza,
even if it's fairly late at night, I feel pretty comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, travelers should always listen to their
self-preservation instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be so paranoid that you don't meet people and you don't
enjoy yourself, but don't overlook your gut feelings,'' Rundquist
says. ``If you have a gut sense that something is wrong or someone
is following you, leave the area and go to somewhere you feel more
comfortable. At the worst, you'll feel a little silly later.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a small price to pay for avoiding a potentially bad
situation.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT MIFFED OVER CBS REPORT OF INCREASED CRIME IN BRITAIN
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDN _ A report on CBS News that crime in Britain has grown
worse than it is in the United States, has come under attack from
government and tourism officials here worried that fearful
Americans may take their vacation dollars elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which aired Tuesday evening, depicted Britain as
``one of the most violent urban societies in the Western world, a

robbed are substantially greater than in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rather, the veteran news anchor, introduced the story by
noting that it represents a substantial departure from conventional
images of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer, thousands of Americans will travel to Britain,
expecting a civilized island free from crime and ugliness and, in
many ways, it is that,'' Rather said. ``But now, like the U.S., the
UK has a crime problem and, believe it or not, except for murder,
theirs is worse than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS reporter Tom Fenton cited an unpublished government report
that says violent crime has jumped 19 percent this year compared to
last year. Robberies in London have increased nearly 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the story, Prime Minister Tony Blair's government moved
quickly to counter the report without denying the substance of it.
With national elections expected next year, the rising crime rate
is emerging as a key issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Office _ similar to the U.S. Attorney General _ issued
a statement saying the CBS report was ``simplistic'' and based on
flawed comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   The British government also went on the offensive, noting that
the murder rate in Britain is 1.43 per 100,000 residents compared
with 6.26 in the United States. The rate for London is 2.09 per
100,000 population, compared to 8.6 in New York and 49.15 in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American is seven times more likely to be murdered
than a British citizen, and 60 times more likely to be shot dead,''
the Home Office said.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS report acknowledged that Britain still has one of the
lowest murder rates in Europe, but it noted that gun violence was
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Handguns are still banned from Britain and very few police
officers are armed. ``This year there have already been hundreds of
shootings in British cities, dozens in London alone _ three of them
in one evening recently,'' Fenton reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the British Tourist Office expressed alarm over
the CBS report's description of British streets and shopping malls
as a ``battleground.'' About 4 million Americans visit Britain each
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that prospective visitors will not be deterred by
these sensationalist stories,'' the tourist office said.
</P>
<P>
   The government refuses to discuss the report upon which the CBS
story was based until it is made public, probably next month. The
report was leaked to the Times of London, which published details
on Sunday, however.
</P>
<P>
   But Home Secretary Jack Straw acknowledged in a recent TV
interview that crime was rising. Straw blamed much of the increase
on drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a general problem of drink-related violence in our
society, particularly amongst younger men, which we have got to
deal with,'' he said. ``It's one of the reasons why the violent
crime figures are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Widdecombe, Straw's counterpart in the Conservative Party,
accused Blair's Labor Party of being soft on crime. ``I think there
are very obvious causes, first of all the huge drop in police,''
she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policemen and particularly constables have dropped by about
2,600 since this government came to power.''

`THE PERFECT STORM': INSTANT CALAMITY (JUST ADD WATER) 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   To put it bluntly, ``The Perfect Storm'' is no ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   This gusty oceanic epic, directed by Wolfgang Petersen (``Air
Force One,'' ``Das Boot'') from Sebastian Junger's best-selling
book, has lollapalooza special effects and gripping ensemble
performances. But its quotient of human drama is finally too stingy
for the personal stories of a group of New England fisherman
battling ``the storm of the century'' to hit the emotional
bull's-eye. When in its final scenes the movie desperately tries to
churn up some of the celestial schmaltz of ``Titanic,'' it is too
little too late and feels obligatory despite the abundance of heart
and chemistry that Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane bring to their
roles of a wildly-in-love young couple.
</P>
<P>
   The film's central character (like the book's) isn't a person
but an actual storm that blew up the New England coast on Halloween
1991. But as much as we try to humanize meteorological disasters by
naming hurricanes and deciphering their personalities through their
histories, storms ultimately don't have feelings or even
intentions. Or at least this one doesn't in its movie incarnation.
The Weather Channel does a better, more thorough and soberer job of
personalizing garden-variety hurricanes than ``The Perfect Storm,''
which relies on reiterated hyperbole to convey the force of its
monster while withholding the kind of detailed meteorological
information that might have generated more suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, for all its wondrous special effects has never been
able to get a firm grip on the weather. As impressive as the some
of its special effects may be, ``The Perfect Storm'' (like
``Twister'' before it) fails to convey the weather's changing moods
and the ominously majestic march of events that signal inclement
weather. The story follows the fateful voyage of a swordfishing
boat, the Andrea Gail, into the North Atlantic, as two storms
collide offshore and combine to ignite a meteorological explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Once the movie leaves the shore, a story that began as a richly
hued mosaic of life in a New England fishing town (Gloucester,
Mass.) quickly succumbs to its own technological wizardry and
becomes waterlogged. ``The Perfect Storm'' is so eager for its big
waves to arrive as soon as possible that it shoehorns in what feels
like an extraneous subplot, lifted from the book, about the rescue
of another vessel and the crash of a Coast Guard helicopter.
Although these sequences are meant to prepare us for the storm that
has yet to overtake the Andrea Gail, they are little more than
distracting adventure filler whose characters aren't even
introduced and therefore mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity is also a big problem in the movie's middle and later
portions, a nearly continuous din of wind and water in which the
boat's crew members all but disappear under their slickers while
desperately trying to keep their vessel afloat. Every so often the
movie hurriedly flashes to shore, where the crew's loved ones
huddle around their television sets waiting for news. But the film
is so impatient to return to its special effects that these scenes
have little resonance.
</P>
<P>
   As the movie repeats the images of wind and waves over and over,
it begins to dawn that the storm in progress is simply too large an
event for the movie to take in. Drowned out by the simulated roar
of nature (reinforced by James Horner's mediocre, obtrusively
pounding score), much of the shipboard dialogue is unintelligible.
Even when daring individual rescues are carried out, it's difficult
to tell who's saving whom.
</P>
<P>
   The endless visual whoosh also makes it hard to keep up with the
emergency navigational procedures that prevent the boat from
breaking apart. And when we don't know quite what's happening, the
crew's hard-won victories seem hollow. After a while the unending
tumult simply becomes monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few tilting shots suggest a boat pitching in the
waves, the camera remains level throughout most of the storm, so
you rarely have a sense of being tossed about on the ocean. In
other words, a dose of Dramamine before the movie is not necessary.
In denying us any sense of stomach-churning chaos, the movie keeps
the violence at such a far remove that it rarely feels especially
scary.
</P>
<P>
   The money shots are parceled out as carefully (and as
parsimoniously) as the movie's personal dramas. The most awesome
(familiar from the movie's ubiquitous trailer) comes very late and
portrays the boat's head-first climb into a looming 90-foot
mountain of water. It is the one stunner in a movie that could have
done with two or three more knockout visuals.
</P>
<P>
   In the end ``The Perfect Storm'' feels like two movies grafted
together. The first third is a glowing portrait of Gloucester and
the salty, roughneck flavor of its fishing industry. In a series of
short but pungent scenes, we meet its fishermen and are introduced
to the risky, competitive, low-paying enterprise of swordfish
harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's vision of this life is unabashedly romantic but
convincing, thanks largely to Bill Wittliff's economical
screenplay, which keeps its ear attuned to the Yankee dialect. When
a fleet arrives back at port, the women ecstatically pour out of
their homes to greet their men on the docks, and the town begins to
pulse. The sight of tipsy couples in a waterfront bar joyously
swaying in each other's arms to the lusty strains of Bruce
Springsteen's ``Hungry Heart'' produces a pang of longing to
embrace this elemental livelihood and the working-class solidarity
that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's Romeo and Juliet, Bobby Shatford (Wahlberg), a
divorced, financially troubled fisherman, and his adoring fiancee,
Christina (Lane), may no longer be teen-agers, but they exude the
radiant passion of high-school sweethearts. These lovers give the
movie most of its warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Although George Clooney has a more substantial role as the
boat's captain, Billy Tyne, the character remains an enigma.
Clooney conveys a darkly heroic gravity, but his lack of even a
trace of a New England accent makes him seem socially out of place
in a cast whose other members get the regional dialect more or less
right. The movie tentatively teases us with the possibility that
Billy, who has had a run of disappointing catches, will become
involved with Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), a
fellow fisherman who has her own boat and has had a string of good
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Had the movie envisaged a ``Moby-Dick''-like struggle between
Billy and the superstorm into which he steers the Andrea Gail with
a reckless determination, ``The Perfect Storm'' might have accrued
some heavy allegorical weight. Certainly Clooney's Billy, with his
glowering dark-circled eyes, ruddy, stubbled face and air of
impermeable masculinity, suggests a man peering challengingly into
the eye of fate. But ``The Perfect Storm'' misses its opportunity
to evoke a metaphysical struggle, and it is much the poorer for it.
</P>
<P>
   In its most solemn moments ``Titanic'' plunged us into a
panorama of death, surrounding us with shipwrecked passengers
moaning and crying as they slowly froze in the North Atlantic
water. In the one comparable image in ``The Perfect Storm'' the
camera slowly pulls from a lone man in the ocean to observe him
from afar, a speck of life bobbing helplessly on the heaving waves.
It's only a glimpse of eternity, and not nearly enough to stir up
the awe that is missing from the heart of the film.

 &HT;    Girls are GEEKS too!
 &HT;    By Charlotte Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It takes a woman to tell this story, a woman who
was once a mid-teenager too old to play with dolls but not quite
old enough to drive. A woman who can relate to the inner workings
of a 15-year-old girl whose physical composition is 85 percent
gangly limbs, 10 percent braces and 5 percent stuff that's just
starting to make sense. A woman who would not be put off by a girl
who uses the word ``like'' 37 times in each of her tediously
unforgiving run-on sentences. A woman who would not be annoyed by a
girl with an earsplitting guffaw-screech-snort that follows every
one of her best friend's only mildly funny comments.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a woman to tell this story simply because she was this
very kind of girl at one point. And unlike teen-age boys _ whose
interests seem to oscillate timelessly between cars and the
sex-symbols of the era _ her well-being hinged on her capacity for
optimally uninhibited and uninterrupted communication. One wonders
what girls did before His Highness, Alexander Graham Bell,
contrived the blessed device that allowed for anytime conferencing
about fashion faux pas, cute teachers or the coordination of the
same kind of sandwich in tomorrow's lunch boxes. The teen girl's
telephone was as sacred and essential a prop as a Christian's cross
or a judge's gavel. Given the chance, teen girls might have
single-fingeredly dialed the contraption up as the most influential
invention of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But then along came ``Dad's'' computer; a big, clunky,
unimpressive machine that helped fathers with their work; a machine
toward which brothers and sons seemed to naturally gravitate _
clear-cut signs that it was nothing of value to her. Who knew that
it would eventually reshape human interaction on such a global
scale? Chances are, men didn't even realize its potential at the
time, but their early appreciation for the computer and its
offerings gave them an impressive head start.
</P>
<P>
   Women's uphill battle of playing technological catch-up at times
seems futile, at other times absolutely impossible. Nevertheless,
recent years have seen a slew of female leaders who are determined
to get girls thinking beyond the wonders of the telephone by
tapping into the double-X chromosomers and their computers _ that
market just waiting to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   One such leader, Laura Groppe, president and chief executive
officer of Girl Games, Inc. _ a local research and product
development company that focuses on girls ages 8 to 18 _ is using
activities like focus groups and slumber parties to fill the
technological gap that still exists between boys and girls, all in
an effort to help realize her vision of living in a world where
women rival and often surpass men in areas of technology awareness.
</P>
<P>
   THE SLUMBER PARTY
</P>
<P>
   It's 7:15 p.m., a tepid evening in central Austin's bourgeois
Clarksville community. Bees swarm noisily at the front door of Dr.
Verlis Setne's house but the buzz inside is much more inviting. A
group of girls swarm around Kelly Green's Dell computer. Green, 16,
and her sister, Cyan, 14, are hosting a slumber party coordinated
by Girl Games, Inc. In attendance are Katharine Quintanilla, Alison
Colby, Jessica Sanders, Stephanie Wiggins, Kristen Schilt _ all
ranging in age from 13 to 26 _ and Laura Groppe. They are a trendy
collage of contemporary girlhood _ pinks, purples and other
pastels, baggy jeans, black nails, belly rings, tight T-shirts,
multi-colored hair and bare feet all swathed in the distinct sugary
aroma of bubble gum. They stand looking over Green's shoulder as
she adroitly uses her computer mouse and keyboard to pull up
various Web sites, which they critique. Chit-chat spurts in patches
of disjointed, almost alien, conversation. First there's the tech
talk:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop-up ads annoy me. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Animated banners are OK, but they're kind of irritating after
a while, though. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Groovygames.com is, like, so cool. Oh my God, you can have a
tea party with Hello Kitty . . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to nme.com every single day. They have a lot of, like. .
.in America nowadays it's really hard to get British music but this
site actually has a lot of it. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Kelly, where's your printer?''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's fashion talk:
</P>
<P>
   ``So, are you really working at Sonic or did you just, like,
take the visor?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the visor from a friend of mine who got fired from
Sonic and so I kinda snagged it. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's so funny, like, your friends who used to work
places and they'll just have, like, a random McDonald's uniform. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to buy a postman's uniform from that Joseph's Men's
Shops on Congress but they would never let me buy one, you have to
be, like, an official mailman or something . . .''
</P>
<P>
   And talk of the arts:
</P>
<P>
   ``My all-time favorite musical is ``Guys and Dolls.'' I like
``West Side Story,'' too. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, speaking of ``West Side Story,'' what do you guys think of
those Gap ads?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get, like, totally addicted to the Gap commercials. I
mean, I don't go to Gap that much but those commercials are just so
good, and, like, the music is so totally good. . .''
</P>
<P>
   These topics are hit and hit again before 7:25 p.m. Sooner than
expected, the girls shut off the computer and migrate into the
living room where Gumby's cheese pizza awaits. Intimate verbal
chaos ensues among the eight people who somehow manage to
successfully carry on as many discussions. Here's some of what was
gleaned: The only good thing on MTV is the animated show,
``Daria;'' drugs and alcohol in our local high schools are
frighteningly prevalent; BET shows much more skin than MTV or VH1;
LBJ High School is merely a governmental experiment to study the
results of mixing virgin girls with mutant males; when Sisqo's
``Thong song'' comes on you gotta get up and dance; people who
enter chat rooms leave their grammar skills at the door; Britney
Spears (and, apparently, any other female celeb popular with the
boys) sucks; Hillary Swank's head is too big for her body; the Got
Milk ads are lame but Kibbles 'n' Bits ads are funny. Oh, and leave
two or more girls alone in a room with a Squier electric guitar and
amplifier and songs that only those girls can fully appreciate will
be composed.
</P>
<P>
   In short, what transpires is constant senseless gab and
activities that have seemingly little purpose, i.e. your typical
all-girl slumber party.
</P>
<P>
   Which this particular party is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Groppe, assisted by her analysts, Schilt and Wiggins, are busy
collecting data. The three blend almost too perfectly: Groppe,
lying on the floor completely enthralled by one girl's soliloquy
about her premature angst; Wiggins in a cropped Girl Games T-shirt
and fashionable blue jeans, and Schilt with black and blond Pippi
Longstocking ponytails and stories of tongue piercings. They
expertly pose questions that instigate the type of uninhibited raw
conversation that will be analyzed later to determine how to
effectively appeal to the teen girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do a brain dump or download later at the office then
keep our information in a database,'' Groppe said. ``These girls
turn into the characters we're developing; we get that just by
hanging out with them.''
</P>
<P>
   While the girls display obvious tech skills, very little of the
discussion is directly related to technology. Only when specific
topics are brought up do these girls speak about computers, the
Internet or video games.
</P>
<P>
   ``My competition is friends, the mall and the telephone,''
Groppe said. ``I'm battling for time. Girls use technology as it's
relevant to their world. Content is a problem. There definitely
needs to be a bigger market with more variety so that there are
more opportunities and options for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   HOW THE PARTY STARTED
</P>
<P>
   Groppe was never really one to be intimidated by those things
deemed impossible. Towering at 5 feet 10 inches with a solid
physique, this 36-year-old credits her award-winning work as a
Hollywood movie and video producer as the impetus that led to the
success of her company. Groppe is confident that her background
validates her ability to outfit young women with the tools they'll
need to compete in an interactive future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition (from producing to running her own company) was
not a frightening thing,'' Groppe said. ``What was a little unknown
was what on Earth I had a skill set for. As it turns out, it was
really a function of knowing how to manage creative people and I
knew how to think about a product and how all the money has to go
toward making it a good product.''
</P>
<P>
   So at 29, Groppe left the glitz and glamour of California and
moved back home to Houston. Soon, she was using the extra space in
her father's office as a corporate base. ``It was a tiny room with
a phone and it was like, 'Hello, Girl Games!' '' Groppe laughs,
holding a mock phone up to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   But the research she'd conducted would impress the National
Science Foundation at Rice University, Groppe's first backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to really build up our case,'' she said. ``Way back
when in '94 we were still dealing with girls saying 'I'm afraid of
the computer' and 'it's my dad's machine.' Yet, our research was
demonstrating 'but if you get me in front of a machine and if you
give me something interesting, by God I'll spend some time at it.'
''
</P>
<P>
   The funding from Rice afforded Groppe more space and analysts to
help produce. When she had a clear idea of her plan, she called
Simon and Schuster, the publishing company, ``because they
published Nancy Drew,'' she said. ``I thought, publishing company
with a weakness for women _ I'm bound to be able to convince
them.'' And convince them she did. ``They said, 'How much money do
you need to do this CD-ROM?' and I said, 'uh . . . $250,000.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was not even close to what she really needed, and she
eventually was forced to go back to the publisher for more funding.
In any event, ``Let's Talk About Me!'' Girl Games' first CD-ROM
that Newsweek called a ``digital Kaboodles kit of activities,'' was
a successful endeavor and ``pretty aces for a first product out on
the market,'' Groppe said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost five years, five CD-ROMs, a powerhouse research lab and
an award-winning product development group later, Girl Games, Inc.,
he for itself. In August of last year it announced a new
subsidiary, Planetgirl.com, a Los Angeles-based online network for
teen girls covering topics ranging from music and fashion to
relationships and sports.
</P>
<P>
   The future of Girl Games is all about being No. 1 in researching
and understanding the teen-age female demographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the leadership position,'' Groppe said. ``We've got a
five-year-old database; we recognize the trends. Now we've got to
take that to the next level.''

THEY ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE THAT IT'S POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us feel pretty athletic if we run a few miles or master
in-line skating in the driveway. We talk about hitting a runner's
high or finding the zone as if we're really accomplishing something
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is a movie like ``Extreme'' to wipe those notions
away. The IMAX film features world-class athletes who have
conquered extreme sports _ surfing, windsurfing, skiing,
snowboarding, rock climbing and ice climbing. They're risk-takers,
top-of-their-sport champions who attempt the impossible to prove
that it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have fear; fear is the thing that keeps you sane,''
says ice climber Barry Blanchard, who proceeds to climb his way up
the Delphine Glacier in Canada, one of the world's most spectacular
icefalls (a frozen waterfall). Sanity is debatable, and Blanchard
looks fearless _ but fear is a given in extreme sports.
</P>
<P>
   Big-wave surfers in Hawaii tackle some of the biggest waves ever
surfed. The surfers hit the North Shore of Hawaii just as El Nino
did, in 1998; the unprecedented waves canceled official surfing
competitions, but the surfers in ``Extreme'' went out there anyway
and rode 40-foot waves _ something surfers had never accomplished
before.
</P>
<P>
   Also in ``Extreme'': champion wind surfers in Hawaii take on
some of Maui's highest winds, skiers maneuver down almost-vertical
slopes in Alaska, and rock climbers dangle high above the ground in
southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the IMAX screen's immense size, viewers can imagine
they're in the middle of it all, hanging from rocks or gliding down
steep slopes with the athletes. The experience is simultaneously
daunting and inspiring. It's clear that these extreme athletes are
part of an exclusive club. The rest of us will have to settle for
some waterskis and a lake and the illusion of greatness.

BRITISH GALLERY GETS A CIMABUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After months of intense negotiations, the National
Gallery of Art in London will acquire its first painting by
Cimabue, the 13th-century Italian painter and mosaicist, who
predated Giotto and Duccio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Two Angels'' (circa
1285), an 8-by-10-inch wood panel on gold ground, was discovered by
Sotheby's experts when they went to catalog old master paintings at
Benacre Hall, a Palladian villa near Lowestoft in Suffolk, England.
The painting was being sold by the estate of Sir John Gooch, who
died last year and whose family had lived at Benacre Hall since the
early 19th century. It is one of only seven or eight independent
panel paintings by Cimabue in existence and the only one in private
hands. It is the first work by the artist to be enter any museum
collection in England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gallery tries to tell the story of Italian painting from
the Renaissance, and every history book begins with Cimabue,'' said
Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery. ``But we didn't
have one. We've waited 170 years to find this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cimabue was to be auctioned at Sotheby's sale of old master
paintings in London on Thursday but was withdrawn when Alan
Howarth, the arts minister, announced that the government had
accepted the Cimabue in lieu of estate taxes and would present it
to the Gallery. The Gooch estate will be given a tax break of $6.87
million, and Sir Paul Getty, a son of J. Paul Getty and a longtime
supporter of the Gallery, has paid an additional $1.05 million to
the Gooch family. Sir Timothy Gooch, an heir, said in a statement
issued by Sotheby's Thursday that he was ``delighted that the
painting had been acquired in this way for the national collection,
even though this represented a financial sacrifice'' on the part of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   In February, when Sotheby's announced it had discovered the
Cimabue, the National Gallery made it plain that it wanted the
painting. It was clear that if the panel had gone to auction and
been sold to an institution or collector outside Britain, probably
it would not have been given an export license without an effort to
find a British institution that could match the buyer's price.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say Sotheby's was at first reluctant to make a deal on
behalf of the estate, believing it could get a bigger price at
auction. But as news of the National Gallery's interest spread,
executives realized other institutions would be discouraged from
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the National Gallery and the estate began in
February but were unsuccessful because at that point the estate did
not have such a large tax bill. But in May, Sotheby's sold the
contents of Benacre Hall in a three-day sale that grossed $12.5
million, a record for a country-house auction. The success of the
sale meant the estate had a larger tax bill than it had
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Cimabue also escalated. In February, Sotheby's
experts said they thought it could bring $3 million. In March, they
revised the estimate to $7.5 million, and last month to $15.1
million. ``When we first announced the sale, we were testing the
waters,'' said Alexander Bell, head of Sotheby's old master
painting department in London. ``We didn't have anything to compare
it to.'' But as interest in the panel mounted, so did the price.
``There has been great institution and private interest outside the
U.K.,'' Bell added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Madonna and Child Enthroned With Two Angels'' is one of
Sotheby's greatest discoveries. It is part of a small tabernacle, a
portion of which is in the Frick Collection in New York. After
sophisticated tests to determine the age of the wood and pigments,
Sotheby's consulted Dillian Gordon, the curator of early Italian
paintings at the National Gallery in London, who, with Sotheby's
experts, concluded that it was by Cimabue. Sotheby's also took the
panel to New York to study it alongside the Frick's Cimabue. It was
then, Bell said, that experts had no doubt it was by the Italian
master. He added, ``It must be the most important early Italian
picture to have been on the market in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   GUGGENHEIM FINALISTS
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has announced the international
finalists for its Hugo Boss Prize, a $50,000 award named for its
sponsor, a German men's wear company, and given every two years to
an artist whose work represents a significant development in
contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists, ranging from 29 to 60 in age, are interested in
work relating to public space. The winner is to be announced in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are Vito Acconci, 60, an American conceptual
artist; Maurizio Cattelan, 40, an Italian artist perhaps best
remembered for a performance piece at the 1999 Venice Biennale in
which he hired an Indian fakir to lie buried in sand for several
hours at a stretch with only his hands protruding; Michael
Elmgreen, 39, who is Danish, and Ingar Dragset, 31, who is
Norwegian, both of whom live and work in Berlin and create
sculptural installations; Tom Friedman, 35, an American sculptor;
Barry Le Va, 59, an American post-minimalist sculptor; Marjetica
Potrc, 47, a Slovenian artist known for architectural
installations, and Tunga, 48, a Brazilian sculptor and performance
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the usual suspects,'' said Lisa Dennison, a deputy
director at the Guggenheim and its chief curator. ``These artists
span three generations.'' Unlike the Tate Gallery's prestigious
Turner Prize, given every year to a British artist under 50, the
Hugo Boss Prize sets no restrictions on age or nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why no painters were among the finalists, Dennison said:
``There were plenty of painters nominated, but none were chosen.
What this list shows is an international group of contemporary
artists who reflect a trend we're seeing in art that engages public
spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of tight scheduling and a lack of space, Dennison said,
the Guggenheim will show only the winner's work rather than an
organizing an exhibition of the finalists' work, as in past years.
The show is to open in February. The museum plans to publish a
catalog of the finalists' work.

 &HT;    AGENCY SAYS NO TO PLAN FOR ELDERLY HELPERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 2
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every day, two or three volunteers arrive at the
Joseph L. Morse Geriatric Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., to help
the nursing home residents there eat lunch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a program that has worked well for 17 years, but it's not
enough for the home's 280 residents, says Scott Boord, the center's
vice president and chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
   That's because there is little consistency from day to day with
volunteers. And because the volunteers are elderly and usually just
help at lunch time, they're not available to help at breakfast or
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So Morse Geriatric, like many nursing homes across the country,
wants to hire workers to assist their residents at meal times _
and, in some places, to help push wheelchair-bound residents from
place to place within the home.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says the federal government's Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which oversees Medicare and Medicaid and
helps pay for many nursing home residents.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA officials say the law requires anyone providing nursing
services _ which include helping residents eat or be transported _
must be at least a certified nursing assistant (CNA) with 75 hours
of training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law makes it clear that feeding is a nursing-related
service,'' said Chris Peacock, a HCFA spokesman who said the agency
is concerned with the problems of caring for residents at meal
times and is trying to devise a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is strike the right balance between
assuring residents of safe, quality care and increase flexibility
for nursing homes that are trying to do the right thing,'' Peacock
said.
</P>
<P>
   A bill filed in Congress in May by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.,
would allow workers trained in a single task to provide services
such as feeding and pushing wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is good for nursing home residents who
benefit from the extra personal assistance that these aides
provide,'' Ryan said. ``It's also good for busy nurses and CNAs who
work in nursing homes, freeing them up a bit so that they have more
time to use their extensive training to meet residents' other
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation is a top priority of the American
Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, which represents
5,600 not-for-profit nursing homes and related senior facilities,
said spokesman Robert Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for nursing home residents are skeptical of Ryan's
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel it solves the staffing crisis,'' said Janet
Wells, director of public policy for the National Citizens'
Coalition for Nursing Home Reform.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is concerned that a shortage of nursing assistants
has led to a surge in health care problems such as dehydration,
pressure sores and painful muscle contractures among residents who
don't receive enough personal care and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employment of single task workers is likely to exacerbate
conditions that make it difficult to retain nursing home
employees,'' the coalition said in a recent position paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure to improve wages and benefits will be reduced;
nursing assistants will be assigned more residents to care for
because of the perception that their workload has been lightened;
full-time nursing assistants will be given the heaviest, most
repetitive or least desirable task; and personal communication and
contact between residents and nursing assistants will be further
reduced,'' the coalition said.
</P>
<P>
   While the bill sits in two House committees _ Ways and Means and
Commerce _ several states have been stymied in their efforts to
allow single task employees to work in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Illinois have both passed laws allowing the use of
single task workers in their states, but the laws have not been
implemented because of opposition from the federal government. Ohio
and Minnesota also have urged HCFA to allow them to use single task
workers. The requests have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin, which has been using single task employees since 1993
to help feed nursing home residents, has been the most active in
forcing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey showed that in roughly one-fourth of Wisconsin's
190 not-for-profit nursing homes, 244 single task workers were
helping feed 525 residents. Another 44 nursing homes had plans to
hire single task workers in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Wisconsin officials asked HCFA for a ruling
to allow them to continue using single task employees. HCFA denied
the request, touching off a letter from eight Wisconsin lawmakers _
including both senators _ asking the agency to clarify its position
on what services it considers ``nursing and nursing related.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the delegation has not received a response from HCFA
and Wisconsin's Bureau of Quality Assurance has not enforced the
ban on single task workers while waiting for further word from the
federal agency.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the single task workers are either high school students
or young retirees interested in working part-time, said John Sauer,
executive director of the Wisconsin Association of Homes and
Services for the Aging.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these workers are interested solely in helping residents
eat _ for which they receive a day or two of training _ and are not
interested in providing other nursing services such as assisting
residents in bathing, grooming or using the toilet, Sauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Having single task employees on hand allows the nursing
assistants to work with residents who need more extensive help,
Sauer said. It also provides a base for recruiting future nursing
personnel in a state that faces a severe labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a win-win situation,'' he said, noting that having
single task employees around at meal time makes eating a more
social experience and the interaction between residents and workers
benefits both.
</P>
<P>
   --STORY COULD TRIM HERE--
</P>
<P>
   Most nursing homes in Wisconsin are strapped for qualified
employees, Sauer said, noting the state has an unemployment rate
below 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every nursing home that I know of is out there actively trying
to recruit CNAs,'' he said. ``We have facilities that are looking
to contract with a company to bring in nurses from the
Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's ombudsman for nursing homes, George F. Potaracke has
been lukewarm about single task employees.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Ryan last month, Potaracke said he was concerned
that ``implementation of a single task worker category will, in no
small measure, diminish the overall value, function and appeal of
the position of certified nursing assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Potaracke indicated he was aware of the labor shortage
problem and suggested that ``it may be possible that single task
workers, properly selected, trained, supervised and utilized''
could be a temporary solution.
</P>
<P>
   Potaracke suggested that Congress consider authorizing some
demonstration projects of 18 months to three years duration to see
how the single task concept works.

THE TRUTH ABOUT BRADENTON, FLA. 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was alarmed to read that ``Money'' magazine selected Bradenton
as one of the nation's top five places to retire.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine called Bradenton a ``first-class Florida beach
town,'' which does not say much for Florida's other beach towns
since Bradenton is located several miles inland. Perhaps the
magazine's editors are taking this global warming thing more
seriously than the rest of us. (Book your reservations at the Blue
Boy motel today.)
</P>
<P>
   But let us not quibble. Bradenton is located close to the Gulf
of Mexico and you can drive there if the traffic is not too bad and
the bridges are not stuck open. Once there, you can indeed cavort
on 27 miles of white-sand beaches, as the magazine states, assuming
you can find a parking space.
</P>
<P>
   I am not saying these nasty things about Bradenton simply
because I live there and don't want 100,000 more elderly people
from Michigan competing with me for starting times or taking all
the good tables at Morrison's.
</P>
<P>
   No, I just think that people need to know that Bradenton isn't
nearly as nice as ``Money'' magazine makes it out to be and that
retirees might be better off relocating in other ``first-class
beach towns'' like Asheville, N.C., or Fort Collins, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money'' magazine contends that Bradenton is a good place to
retire to because the average home price is $126,100. A home of
that price would indeed be comfortable if you live alone and don't
plan on bringing any furniture with you. If you would like to live
in something more spacious than a walk-in closet, then you should
be prepared to spend more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money'' claims that Bradenton has 238 sunny days a year, and
says it as if that were a good thing. Spend one summer in Bradenton
and you will have a much less charitable opinion of our sun, which
is capable of melting cars into puddles of goo and causing people's
hair to spontaneously combust.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the alternatives to the sun, hurricanes and
wrath-of-God thunderstorms are not that appealing either. People
who live in Bradenton spend most of their time cowering in their
bathtubs under a mattress or pouring water on their smoking heads.
This is not my idea of carefree retirement living, but then again,
I suppose it all depends on what you're used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money'' also points out that Bradenton is located only 30
minutes from Tampa, and again makes it sound as if that were a good
thing. Tampa is the place to go if you enjoy getting lost in a maze
of one-way streets on your way to the adult-entertainment district.
Tampa also has an airport, but then again so does Bradenton, so I
wouldn't consider that any big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bradenton gets high marks from ``Money'' magazine because
several professional sports teams are located within an hour's
drive. One of those ``professional'' teams is the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays which, thanks to strong pitching and clutch hitting in the
month of June, have improved to last place in the American League
East. The nice thing about being a fan of the Devil Rays is that
you don't have to contend with large crowds; the bad thing is that
you have to perform ``the wave'' all by yourself, which requires a
lot of running and jumping around.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, before you decide to retire to Bradenton on the basis
of ``Money'' magazine's recommendation, remember that the magazine
was also profoundly smitten last year with Punta Gorda, which,
cosmopolitan-wise, makes Bradenton seem like San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   This is not meant to disparage San Francisco, which I understand
is a very nice place, especially for retirees.

NBC PROMISES FEWER ADS IN SYDNEY OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``s'' sports news file)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC assembled its Olympics talent for a satellite press
conference this week and behold, there was immediate good news.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said the network would devote
less time to commercials during the Sydney, Australia, Games than
it did in the Atlanta Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, but some, bless their barnacled little hearts, and the
O.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said the allotted time would be 9 minutes an hour in
prime time, compared with 9 1/2 minutes during the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The figure doesn't include promo spots and other interruptions.
But the grand total should still fall short of normal prime-time
clutter. Given the trend toward commercial expansion, that's good
enough news to applaud NBC and give it 15 seconds back. On second
thought, nah.
</P>
<P>
   This will matter to you because come September, when you expect
to see the usual fusillade of new series on the networks, you'll be
seeing Olympics gymnastics, swimming and wrestling instead.
</P>
<P>
   The other networks apparently plan to hold their new wares until
after the Summer Olympics, which run September 15 to October 1.
</P>
<P>
   There's another holdover piece of good news, in case you haven't
heard. John Tesh won't be doing the gymnastics coverage. Al
Trautwig, and for two days Tom Hammond, will be in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Olympics gymnastics is the gig I wish Dennis Miller had
landed, rather than NFL football on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will of course gorge itself on the Olympics. The network is
expected to carry 162 1/2 hours of coverage, about the same as in
Atlanta. But that's just the broadcast network. The cable role will
be stepped up this time, with NBC corporate cousins CNBC and MSNBC
combining for an additional 279 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That's 441 1/2 hours of television coverage, none of it live _
another departure from Atlanta. Sydney is 15 hours ahead of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   So the NBC network, in particular, will package the greatest
event in sports into videotaped stories about perseverance and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Storytelling, Olympics production chief David Neal said at the
press conference, ``is our mantra here at NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying meaning of ``storytelling'' is that NBC needs to
attract female viewers who otherwise wouldn't be caught dead
watching wrestlers and pole vaulters.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC and MSNBC are the designated outlets for sports in purer
terms. Generally, while gymnastics, swimming, diving and some
track-and-field events will be dominant on NBC, the two cable
channels will provide more extended coverage of ``lesser'' events.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing will be big on CNBC; women's soccer, spearheaded by the
powerful U.S. team, will be the top feature on MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Costas will be the main host on the broadcast network. His
cable counterparts will be Jim Lampley on MSNBC and Pat O'Brien on
CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Other points from the press conference:
</P>
<P>
   _ Supplementing its access to the TV feed from the Australian
host broadcasters, NBC will have 115 of its own cameras in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   _ The NBC production team is obviously infatuated with Sydney
and Australia; Neal, who's made 20 trips Down Under to prepare for
the Olympics, says NBC will pay ``keen attention'' to showcasing
Sydney with travelogue-type features.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ebersol said NBC is ``now certain to eke out a small profit on
these Games.'' The network is paying $3.5 billion for rights to
five consecutive Olympics, beginning with Sydney. These Olympics
account for $705 million of the total.
</P>
<P>
   _ The profit prediction comes despite the anticipation of lower
ratings than the 21.6 prime-time average in Atlanta. NBC projects a
17.5 to 18.5 rating average for Sydney. The difference is that four
years ago, the Games were on American soil and events were
televised live.
</P>
<P>
   _ The World Wide Web component will be vastly expanded. NBC and
its Web partner, Quokka Sports of San Francisco, are already up and
running with www.nbcolympics.com. It's full of data, athlete bios,
charts, video and audio elements and interactive features, and it's
impressive.

NBC PROMISES FEWER ADS IN SYDNEY OLYMPICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news 
 file)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC assembled its Olympics talent for a satellite press
conference this week and behold, there was immediate good news.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said the network would devote
less time to commercials during the Sydney, Australia, Games than
it did in the Atlanta Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, but some, bless their barnacled little hearts, and the
O.
</P>
<P>
   Ebersol said the allotted time would be 9 minutes an hour in
prime time, compared with 9 1/2 minutes during the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The figure doesn't include promo spots and other interruptions.
But the grand total should still fall short of normal prime-time
clutter. Given the trend toward commercial expansion, that's good
enough news to applaud NBC and give it 15 seconds back. On second
thought, nah.
</P>
<P>
   This will matter to you because come September, when you expect
to see the usual fusillade of new series on the networks, you'll be
seeing Olympics gymnastics, swimming and wrestling instead.
</P>
<P>
   The other networks apparently plan to hold their new wares until
after the Summer Olympics, which run September 15 to October 1.
</P>
<P>
   There's another holdover piece of good news, in case you haven't
heard. John Tesh won't be doing the gymnastics coverage. Al
Trautwig, and for two days Tom Hammond, will be in his place.

HOME VIDEO NOTES AND NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LIKE A FEATURE, ONLY SHORTER
</P>
<P>
   Action and drama are in store as a young man in trouble drags
his family into a bad situation. Hand that general story line to a
major moviemaker, and a couple of years later one can plan on
spending at least 130 minutes at the multiplex. The Australian film
``Bloodlock,'' on the other hand, gets the entire tale told in 26
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting extras. ``Bloodlock'' is on DVD, one of 11 short
films on ``Short 9: Trust,'' to be released Wednesday by Quickband,
a Hollywood producer and distributor, and Warner. DVD usually
entails added features, and ``Bloodlock'' has a commentary track by
its directors, actors and producers, along with deleted scenes and
outtakes. In the miniworld of short film, nothing takes too long.
On ``Short 9,'' the ninth DVD in a series from Quickband, all 11
films and their extras are over in 160 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of feature films would benefit by being shorts,'' said
Milos Stehlik of Facets Multimedia, a Chicago video distributor and
mail order company that carries the first eight ``Short'' discs,
each with about 10 short films.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely seen except at film festivals and on cable, shorts
normally run up to 30 minutes. Many are products of young directors
on their way to feature filmmaking. Shorts obviously get to the
point quickly, but the curious thing about the best of them is that
they do a more effective job of storytelling than most full-length
features.
</P>
<P>
   Some films in the ``Short'' series have gone in the opposite
direction and been adapted into full-length movies. ``Short 1:
Invention'' includes George Hickenlooper's 25-minute ``Some Folks
Call It a Sling Blade,'' which was enlarged into an Oscar-winning
version by Billy Bob Thornton. ``La Jetee (The Leap),'' Chris
Marker's haunting 29-minute short about an emissary from a doomed
world sent to get help in the past and future, was the basis for
Terry Gilliam's ``12 Monkeys.'' Gilliam is a fine filmmaker, but
Marker's haunting little movie, made in 1962, got to the story
first and, it could be said, more inventively and compellingly.
</P>
<P>
   The shortest of the shorts, generally in the two-to-six-minute
range, are crazy enough to try anything. Charles Stone III's
``True'' was reworked into the ``Whassup'' Budweiser commercials.
``The Big Story,'' a five-minute Claymation film by Tim Watts and
David Stoten, stars five caricatures of Kirk Douglas working in a
newspaper office.
</P>
<P>
   Themes are recognizable but the treatments are never standard.
In the 20-minute ``Multi-Facial,'' the actor Vin Diesel
metamorphoses every which way in search of a role. Alain Resnais'
30-minute documentary ``Night and Fog'' documents the Holocaust in
far more gripping ways than many longer films.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shorts have won or been nominated for Academy
Awards. ``There's always this hue and cry, `Why have this
category?''' said Sandra Neufeldt of Quickband. ``Nobody watches
these films; nobody can see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant access on DVD can help people get acquainted with a
large number of them and, in the spirit of the material, quickly.
``DVD makes short-watching comfortable,'' Neufeldt said.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   The Talented Mr. Ripley
</P>
<P>
   Posing as a Princeton graduate, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon, left)
goes abroad presumably to help convince the dilettante Dickie
Greenleaf (Jude Law) to return home. Once in Europe, though, Tom
finds a world that a young man on the make could easily get used
to. Ingratiating himself with Dickie, Tom becomes a part of his
circle, but it gradually it occurs to him that, given his talents
with impersonation, he could actually become Dickie. In a
homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps, Anthony Minghella's
film, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``offers
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look.''

   Hanging Up
</P>
<P>
   Three frazzled sisters do their best to keep up with their
elderly father's deteriorating medical condition while staying
connected to frantically busy lives via cordless telephone. Even
the old man (Walter Matthau) is a mean hand with a touch-tone
keypad, constantly harassing Eve (Meg Ryan), the dizziest of the
sisters, from his hospital bed. Maddy (Lisa Kudrow) has a slumping
soap opera career on her hands, while Georgia (Diane Keaton), a
famous magazine editor, has a new publication to get off the
ground. And with Dad to deal with, the film's ``very busyness
ensures that the characters' feelings stay on the surface''
(Stephen Holden).

<P>
   Scream 3
</P>
<P>
   When we left Wes Craven's ``Scream 2,'' all knife-wielding
maniacs supposedly had been sent to the sidelines. Now, though,
someone with those familiar concave cheeks is slicing up people on
a movie set. ``Ten more murders and we have a calendar,'' says a
detective. The killer really wants Sidney (Neve Campbell), the
combative student who gave him so much trouble in earlier
``Scream'' bloodbaths. Dewey (David Arquette), the sheriff's
deputy, is back, as is the scoop-driven newswoman Gale Weathers
(Courtney Cox Arquette), but Sidney is the one in a film that is
``as much a personality show as it is a slasher film'' (Elvis
Mitchell).

captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Women
</P>
<P>
   It's a sorry excuse for cramming five personal stories into one
movie, but here we have a television personality (Carmen Maura)
preparing a documentary in which she asks her friends what they
would do if they had three wishes. Never mind that Maura is a Pedro
Almodovar favorite or that her friends include Miou-Miou, Marisa
Berenson, Marthe Keller and Guesch Patti and that the film was shot
in Portugal. Everybody has the 40-something jitters. Think ``Rohmer
crossed with Almodovar, but on a much lower artistic plane''
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _ 1998. Fox Lorber. $89.98; DVD, $29.98. 95 minutes. French with
English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   While the big films of summer rule the box office, video usually
makes more modest gains at this time of year. Here are some current
best-renters.
</P>
<P>
   THE GREEN MILE. A retired prison guard (Tom Hanks) recalls a
time of spiritual awakening in the '30s when he ran the security on
death row at a Southern prison. Frank Darabont's film is adapted
from Stephen King's novel. 1999. Warner. $109.99; DVD, $24.98. 188
minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   GIRL, INTERRUPTED. Sent to Claymoore psychiatric hospital,
Susanna (Winona Ryder) falls in with the house insurgent (Angelina
Jolie) and learns that her problems may have a fancy clinical label
but can be hung mainly on her neurotic peevishness and a need to
grow up. 1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $24.95. 127
minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   BICENTENNIAL MAN. An industrial robot named Andrew (Robin
Williams) is made of metal but the emotions run gooey for several
generations while the gizmo with a heart finds the woman he loves.
1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $32.99. 131 minutes. Closed
captioned. PG.
</P>
<P>
   PLAY IT TO THE BONE. Two burned-out middleweights (Woody
Harrelson and Antonio Banderas) sign to fight in Las Vegas and
relive their botched title shots and other mainline chances while
being driven across the desert by a woman (Lolita Davidovich) who
was involved with them both. 1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD,
$32.99. 124 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   MAN ON THE MOON. Currently a schizophrenic state trooper in
``Me, Myself and Irene,'' Jim Carrey was the comedian Andy Kaufman
in Milos Forman's film. 1999. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 118

IN SEWARD, ALASKA, THE GLACIERS ARE BREATHTAKING AND THE TOWN IS
LAID-BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL GERST 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESURRECTION BAY, Alaska _ The sky is a deep, cold, crystalline
blue. Off to port, the desolate northern Pacific stretches
endlessly into the distance. To the starboard, the howling wind
sweeps down a mammoth wall of ice, a thousand tiny needles stinging
already reddened cheeks and ears, the bone-deep chill exaggerated
by the speed of the excursion boat.
</P>
<P>
   As you see your breath condensing in the cool air, as you feel
the icy salt spray in your face, you have to keep telling yourself
that this really is August, and back home in the Lower 48, the heat
is unbearable and the land is parched. And then, sipping from a
steaming cup of cocoa, you smile and think to yourself:
``Perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer along the southern coast of Alaska is close to perfect.
Daytime temperatures are springlike, in the upper 60s; nights in
the 40s are tailor-made for cuddling with a comforter in front of
an open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of August, the rainy season begins. Back home,
city officials squabble about water rationing. Here, long,
drenching showers soak the ground early in the day, a perfect time
to linger over a cup of coffee or stretch out in a comfortable
chair with a good book. By midmorning, the rain is gone, leaving
sparkling clear skies.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather isn't the only reason to head north. Alaska
truly is the last frontier, a glimpse at what the rest of the
country must have been like before it was covered with concrete and
asphalt.
</P>
<P>
   The adventurous get here by driving the grueling Alcan Highway,
the 1,500-mile road that snakes its way from Dawson Creek, British
Columbia, to Fairbanks. Once across the Alaskan border, you can
head southwesterly along Highway 1 to Anchorage, and from there
south to the rugged Kenai Peninsula, Seward and Resurrection Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Seward is a wonderful town of about 3,000 on the southern coast
of the peninsula, perfect for getting away _ but not too far away _
from civilization. And, although cruise ships disgorge hundreds of
voyagers each day, the town has relatively few tourist traps and
tacky T-shirt shops.
</P>
<P>
   If you're here to avoid hordes of cruise tourists, just steer
clear of the tiny business district and the waterfront during the
middle of the day. There's plenty of Alaska to enjoy without going
into town.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, thousands make the cruise northwest from Seattle or
Vancouver along the Inside Passage, stopping in Juneau, the
gold-rush town of Skagway or Sitka, a living ``matryoshka'' of
Russian heritage. Other lines dock daily in Seward, and ferries of
the Alaska Marine Highway System connect Juneau with Valdez,
Kodiak, Seward and Homer.
</P>
<P>
   The most convenient approach, however, is to fly into Anchorage,
pick up a car at the airport, then head south on the
well-maintained Seward Highway. If you plan on traveling some of
the peninsula's dirt and gravel roads, spend a few extra dollars
for a sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Even though cruises are a wonderful way to sample several small
coastal towns, your time in each port is limited. It's not that you
can't see all there is to see in a town like Seward in a day. In
fact, you could see almost everything in an hour or two.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the sort of friendly little towns you'd like to
get to know, to call ``home'' for a few days. On top of that, the
125-mile drive from Anchorage down the Kenai Peninsula to Seward is
one of the most breathtaking in the country, full of majestic,
rocky vistas and lush green fields dotted with sweet-smelling
forget-me-nots. There are turnouts every few miles for
picture-taking and for relieving the traffic congestion caused by
the constant parade of awe-stricken motorists.
</P>
<P>
   For all the natural beauty that surrounds it, Seward is a town
that knows hardship. The little fishing village was nearly pounded
out of existence in the deadly 1964 Good Friday earthquake, a 9.2
on the Richter scale. The resultant tsunami demolished the
waterfront, leaving 13 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the locals still tell tales of the quake, not just of the
devastation, but of the determination to rebound. In 1965, a
rebuilding Seward was named an All-America City by the National
Civic League.
</P>
<P>
   But the hardest part of life in Seward is the winter. Spring and
summer are glorious, but the town begins to pay for that as autumn
approaches. This past January, heavy rain and snow caused
avalanches that closed the Seward Highway, cutting the town and the
peninsula off from the rest of Alaska for a week. Only bush pilots
made it in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Why live like that? Spend a week in Seward, and you'll know.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   When you arrive in Alaska for the first time, you're in for a
cultural shock. First, you'll have to get used to ``Alaskan time,''
the quaint concept that nothing is ever so important that it's
worth rushing yourself to death. If New Yorkers have Type A
personalities, then Alaskans have Type Z.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest shock will come when you slow down enough to
enjoy the pristine beauty everywhere around you.
</P>
<P>
   There are several small hotels in Seward, but I rented a small
cabin just outside town, tucked away in a clearing surrounded by
towering trees and dense foliage. My first morning there, I awoke
to the sound of the owners' beagle pup yipping loudly. Stepping
outside, I found the 10-pound dog gamely trying to hold a
1,200-pound moose cow and her two calves at bay not a dozen yards
from my porch.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The taciturn moose, not at all bothered by the noise _ or me _
simply continued to munch on the tall grass, plodding wherever she
wished. Overhead, oblivious to it all, hawks skimmed through the
trees looking for a meal. And next to the cabin was evidence that
the rustling outside last night had in fact been a hungry bear
hoping to find something scrumptious in my garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly you realize that nature is going on all around you,
literally in your front yard. You're little more than a tolerated
interloper. And just as suddenly, you know what makes this place so
special for adopted and native Alaskans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every Alaska resident tells the same story, of how he or
she came for a brief vacation or to work for a summer and wound up
moving north. Call it a shared epiphany, but it seems no one who
witnesses the primeval wonders of Alaska ever feels the same again.
Few places on the planet are as untouched.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel it, too, on a tour of Kenai's fjords and tidewater
glaciers. From the deck of your charter boat, you'll see orcas,
harbor seals, sea lions and the comical tufted puffins, ungainly
seabirds who find themselves too heavy to fly after a meal but who
try it anyway. Nothing, however, prepares you for the sight of a
soaring bald eagle or a pair of humpback whales breaching, then
sounding, the gentle behemoths flipping their tails in farewell as
they slip beneath the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along your voyage, if you're lucky, you'll be
entertained by a school of playful porpoises tagging along next to
the boat. No one knows why they do it. The guide will tell you that
perhaps they're drawn to the thrum of the engines or maybe the
pressure waves peeling back from the bow. Perhaps they just like
the company.
</P>
<P>
   You'll come within a few hundred yards of mountainous, aqua-blue
walls of ice, glaciers spilling out into the sea from the massive
Harding Icefield just beyond. The sound of a glacier calving, of
huge chunks of it splitting off and falling to the water below,
echoes loudly through the fjord, sending the black bears that were
foraging for food near its base scrambling for safety.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to get even closer to a glacier, drive a few miles
north of Seward to the ranger station at the Kenai Fjords National
Park. From there, it's a half-mile hike to Exit Glacier. You can
walk to its base and dip your hand in the icy runoff or take a
winding, steep trail to an overlook to peer deep into caves of ice.
For the hardy, there's a 7-mile hike that flanks the glacier and
looks out over the 300-square-mile ice field beyond from a vantage
spot 3,000 feet above the glacial valley floor.
</P>
<P>
   Keep those hiking boots on, because there are plenty of trails
to explore. Down at the waterfront, there's an easy, paved path
beginning at the original starting point of the Iditarod Trail,
where sled dogs and mushers began the arduous journey to Nome or
points north. If you're up to it, try the 3-mile trail up Mount
Marathon to the 3,000-foot level. Each July Fourth, 800 or more
runners scramble up the steep, muddy trail, and the town turns out
for a daylong party.
</P>
<P>
   The Chugach National Forest is right here, and it's full of
wooded trails and fishing holes. Maps are available in town, and
public-use cabins can be reserved for $35 a night. Camping is legal
anywhere you wish, but you'll need a $15 sport-fishing license if
you bring your rod and reel along.
</P>
<P>
   If you like your fishing a little more exciting than spending a
quiet afternoon by a mountain lake, catch a charter in Seward's
colorful Small Boat Harbor and head out into the bay in hunt of
silver and king salmon. If you manage to reel in the largest fish
during August's Silver Salmon Derby, you could go home with
$10,000. Or try your luck going after giant halibut, which grow up
to 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, don't miss out on a meal of that fresh halibut,
fried crispy and served with chips. Almost every restaurant has it
on the menu. And be forewarned: The portions are enormous wherever
you go.
</P>
<P>
   In a small town like Seward, most restaurants serve a variety of
cuisines. Christo's Palace features Mexican food, steaks, seafood
and pizza, although the pizza is better up the street at the
Apollo, which also specializes in Greek. Or try the spicy kung pao
halibut at the Peking. There's no haute cuisine here, just a lot of
it.
</P>
<P>
   The best home cooking _ and the best small-town gossip _ can be
found at the Marina, a little cafe downtown where the locals order
up their eggs with a side of reindeer sausage or dive into enormous
chili-burgers covered in cheese and onions and buried under a
mountain of shoestring fries. Don't forget to order an Alaskan
Amber or two with that.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't find is fast food, with the exception of a small
Burger King and two Subway locations. The transplanted yuppies like
them, though: no more monthly three-hour drives into Anchorage for
a burger and fries.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. It's really a nice drive.

   CUBA-U.S. (Havana) _ ``At Last in the Fatherland!'' declared the
front page headline in Granma, above pictures of Elian Gonzalez
stepping off the plane and being swept up in a relative's arms in
an emotional end to the seven month custody battle that captivated
this nation. Despite the triumphal headline, the return of the
6-year-old rafter is only the beginning to a continuing campaign by
Cuban officials opposed to the American trade embargo and other
American policies that they say weaken their economy and encourage
people to risk their lives at sea hoping to obtain political
asylum. It is an attempt, foreign officials here said, to tap into
the Cuban public's overwhelming support for Elian's return in order
to rekindle an ardor for the revolution that had steadily cooled in
recent years, especially among the youth who were not even born
during the early glory days of the revolution. By David Gonzalez.

supporters and opponents of the bans said they expected a new

   ISRAEL-AIRCRAFT (Lod, Isrel) _ In the past 15 years, Israel
Aircraft Industries, a military contractor, has been built from
bankruptcy into an export-driven powerhouse. Its specialities
include refurbishing Soviet-era aircraft, and it has developed
electronic espionage devices for Israel's military that are
considered equal to any on the market. So a major contract it
signed with China to convert an Ilyushin into a modern radar plane
showcased the company's strengths. But if the Pentagon has its way,
the converted Ilyushin will never get to China. Since last fall,
Defense Secretary William Cohen has been demanding the deal's
cancellation, and he is backed by powerful members of Congress. By

   NURSING-HOME-WORKERS _ WASHINGTON _ A nursing home in Palm Beach
County, Fla. wants to hire workers to assist elderly residents eat
but has been blocked by a federal regulation. Nursing homes in Ohio
and several other states also want to use ``single task'' employees
to assist residents in eating and to push their wheelchairs from
one place to another. The feds have stopped them. Patient rights
advocates support the government, claiming single task employees
won't solve the problem of understaffing in nusring homes. A bill
is pending in Congress to overturn the regulation blocking single
task workers. (Lipman, Cox News Service). With photos from Palm

   SCHOOLS-DISABLED _ WASHINGTON _ Disappointed by how slowly their
high school graduation and employment rates are rising, disabled
young people at a two-day meeting here demanded a bigger say in how
they are educated in public schools. In candid replies to the
students and their advocates, a dozen Clinton administration
officials explained why the law passed in 1997 to give students
that right is under-enforced, and why it will probably take many
years for most schools to do a better job of coordinating their
education programs with the services provided to the disabled by
other state, local and federal agencies. (Mollison, Cox News

   SOUTH-INFLUENCE _ As the South enters the next century, the
ranks of lobbyists have in state capitals have swollen and begun to
change in ways every bit as dramatic as the partisan shifts in the
legislatures which they attempt to influence. Not long ago, it was
a relatively simple matter to determine the handful of companies,
along with the Farm Bureau or some other powerful, state-based
organization, which held sway in each South legislature. The new
economy and the rise of public-interest lobbying have dramatically
changed this picture. We look at data on political ontributions

yearly ranks the state's most influential lobbyists. (Baxter,

are much too complex. The stuff that follows in the wake of

   MICROSOFT _ REDMOND, Wash. _ The Microsoft programmers butted

made them look like jumbo pink Michelin men, the programmers
clashed, fell down and rolled around, unable to get up again
without help. The immobilized wrestlers symbolized Microsoft today
_ its powerful programming skills and enormous market power in
danger of being toppled and left helpless by a government antitrust
action. But the court battle back in Washington hardly seems to
have registered here in the Seattle suburbs. Pressing ahead to make
its products more all-encompassing than ever, the company's high

   SCRAMBLED-DOGS _ COLUMBUS, Ga. _ It's Saturday at Dinglewood

everybody in Columbus _ even folks in Jaguars from Alabama _ have
got Scramble Dogs on the brain. What's a Scramble Dog? Fanciest
frankfurter known to man. Avatar of hot-dog lore. Object of
adoration and adulation to all who've tried it. A legend in its own
mind, a hotdiggedy, superbad boy on a wet bun, it's the scion of
66-year-old Lieutenant Stevens, who, in case you haven't heard, is
the once and future soda-fountain king of Columbus. But put another
way, it's just a weiner on a bun, smothered with chili, topped with
pickles, chopped onions, cubes of American cheese and oyster
crackers, eaten with a spoon. (Brock/Langhenry, Atlanta

   ARMLESS LANDSCAPER _ CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Even among people who

Landscaping, once tore down houses in Oregon with a hammer and a
crowbar. In another job, he drove a truck across the Rocky

   BOOKS-REVIEW-BRYSON _ No one would mistake Bill Bryson for the
Crocodile Hunter. On TV, the khaki-shorted Steve Irwin pokes at
man-eating reptiles and crawls under houses looking for deadly
snakes. In his latest travelogue, the tweedy, bearded Bryson visits
a secondhand bookstore and picks up a volume about crocodile
attacks and tells us the horrifying tale of an American model who
was standing under a waterfall in western Australia when she
noticed a half-submerged snout swimming toward her. She was last
seen being dragged beneath the surface, a startled look on her
face. (Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)BOOKS-REVIEW-GENDER
_ Only a Nixon could go to China. Only a Clinton could criticize
Sister Souljah. And only a Stephanie Gutman, a civilian and

nation's ability to win wars. (Furnish, Atlanta

   BOOKS-SKUBE _ Larry Woiwode's ``What I Think I Did'' is neither
autobiography nor fiction but rather a memoir in the form of
meditation, with past and present changing into one another like
the colors of a chameleon. One act describes Woiwode and his family
trapped in a blizzard during the winter of 1996-97, the other his
life as a young man in New York when he hung around with an
aspiring teenage actor named Robert DeNiro and caught the eye of
William Maxwell, a revered editor at The New Yorker. The one is
often hypnotic in its imagery (``... a wind hits and streaks of
snow revolve to the horizontal and double in volume, a
white-out.''), the other a recollection of another life and another
world entirely. Of DeNiro he writes: ``When he's unhappy his
parents come up, and he turns on himself, somberly angry, as if the
responsibility he takes for keeping in touch with them, in order to
keep in touch, identifies him as their cause for being apart. An
only child's trial.'' (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 26.

Nothing illustrates the point more clearly than our poetry. What's

Hughes' ``The Negro Speaks of Rivers''? We struggle for tradition,
convinced that it has something to do with time. Some countries, we
tell ourselves, have thousands of years of tradition. But, in fact,
tradition starts from zero, and what many of us miss is that we're
in the process of creating a uniquely American voice. (Martinez,

SWEDISH MASTER OF DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Sweden, Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy)   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second-biggest decorating job in the 18th-century, after
Versailles, was the 608-room Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden.
This palace, which is now partly open to the public, is considered
the largest royal city residence still occupied by a king and
queen.
</P>
<P>
   The original Royal Palace suffered a disastrous fire in 1697 and
had to be rebuilt _ a process that took 54 years. Most of the
interiors were created by Carl Harleman, who, when hired, was a
27-year-old architect who had never built a thing. Harleman worked
on the palace for 26 years; in fact, until he died at age 53, the
year he completed it.
</P>
<P>
   Harleman, who is scarcely known in the United States, is
credited with introducing the rococo style to Sweden and giving it
a distinctly Swedish flavor. ``Harleman may have been trained by
the French, but he added something Swedish to the rococo that made
it his own,'' said Magnus Olausson, a curator at the National
Museum in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   The National Museum has opened an exhibition of Harleman
drawings from its own collection to celebrate the 300th anniversary
of his birth (through Sept. 10). There are exquisite freehand
sketches as well as plans for villas, gardens, household goods like
silver tureens and textiles, even a sarcophagus for King Carl XII.
There are sketches of the many church towers he designed, and they
continue to give Stockholm its distinctive skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Sjoberg, a senior curator at the museum for the last 26
years, explained the appeal of Harleman's work. ``French rococo is
ornate and elaborate, with arabesque elements, shells, scrolls,
branches and flowers seen in all kinds of ormolu mounts and
veneers,'' he said. ``In Sweden, our best architects, like
Harleman, refined the rococo style. He took away any decoration
that was not necessary and made the rococo functional. Even the
sinuous curves in his chairs were not designed only for the eye;
they were engineered to fit the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans who love the Swedish antiques they find at specialist
dealers like Eleish &AMP; Van Breems of Woodbury, Conn.
(www.evbantiques.com) and the reproductions made by Swedish Room
(973 644-4775), will find Harleman's work a revelation. Everything
admired about Swedish style _ the classical proportions, the pale
palette, the charming textiles _ can be traced back to him. He
created the forerunner of the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts,
so his work was passed down to generations of architects and
craftsmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Palace, occupied in 1754 by King Adolf Fredrik and
Queen Lovisa Ulrika, has been redecorated over the centuries. But
Harleman's royal chapel is almost unchanged, as is the magnificent
lacy, gilded stucco work on the ceiling in the queen's antechamber.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better way to see Harleman's work is to visit two of
his manor houses in the Stockholm area. Because of the exhibition,
the state has opened Svartsjo Palace, a small royal hunting castle
Harleman designed in 1731 on the shore of Lake Malaren, the largest
lake in Sweden. It can be visited this summer; in the fall it will
be rented.
</P>
<P>
   It looks a bit like a French chateau, albeit one with a clock
tower added to the roof. Its two-story great hall with trompe
l'oeil windows, faux marble walls and unpainted wide-plank pine
floors have all been restored to their initial style. The 10 rooms
on the ground floor have been furnished with 18th-century portraits
and antiques, including a rococo mirror Harleman designed, with his
signature gilded bird wings flying off the frame.
</P>
<P>
   As both the son and grandson of royal gardeners, Harleman was
initially trained as a garden designer. His Svartsjo garden is
gone, so it is impossible to see how he introduced vegetables into
a formal garden. As Olausson explained: ``In France, there was a
division between a pleasure garden and a potager. Harleman had the
idea to unite utility with pleasure, by converting the formal
garden into a kitchen garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Harleman's early houses were much emulated. ``Svartsjo was the
model for all the manor houses built in the 18th century,'' said
Sjoberg, who owns five of them and is the co-author, with his wife,
Ursula, of ``The Swedish Room,'' published in English by Frances
Lincoln in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Harleman's second manor house, the Svindersvik Pavilion, is now
an adjunct branch of the Nordic Museum in Stockholm. Built as a
summer retreat in about 1750 for Claes Grill, a director of
Sweden's East India Co., it is a small villa overlooking a bay of
the Saltsjon Sea on the eastern approach to Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   It is a one-story building with a pedimented two-story bay in
the center. This house, with only seven rooms, still has its apple
orchard, red barns, separate kitchen and a neo-Classical party
annex. With its high ceilings, large windows and symmetrical floor
plan, it is a study in refined simplicity. The blue and white tile
Swedish stove in the vestibule is paired with a blue and white
painted reproduction, which is a wooden cupboard. The salon is
decorated with handpainted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper and
gilded rococo mirrors. The master bedroom is furnished with pale
gray Gustavian chairs covered in green-and-white checked cotton,
very similar to the reproductions that Ikea once sold in its
Swedish collection. This charming villa would not be out of place
in most small towns in America.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of Harleman (1700-1753) evidenced itself early. His
father, the royal gardener, died when he was 7. ``His mother must
have been a brilliant woman with a strong will,'' Sjoberg said.
``Carl was one of six small children she was left with, but she
recognized his talents early on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1721, on the recommendation of the royal architect Nicodemus
Tessin the Younger, Harleman received a stipend to study art and
architecture abroad. He visited the Netherlands, Belgium, France
and Italy before settling in Paris for four years. There, he won
the first prize for architecture in his class, at age 25.
</P>
<P>
   He was in Venice, Italy, in 1727 when Tessin summoned him to
decorate the royal palace. The rebuilding was about to resume after
a 20-year hiatus caused by the costly wars waged by the romantic
warrior King Carl XII. Harleman rushed home. Three months later,
Tessin died, and his son Carl Gustav was named commissioner of
public buildings. He kept Harleman, who then went to Paris to
recruit artisans to do fancy rococo masonry, stucco work and carved
paneling.
</P>
<P>
   ``No architect has ever been so gifted,'' Olausson said. ``He
did everything.'' The museum show includes his drawings for carved
trophies for the walls, huge wrought-iron lanterns and fanciful
rococo consoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He oversaw everyone who had anything to do with art and
handicraft,'' Sjoberg said. ``Harleman has always been a name in
Sweden, but no one knew how much he did because he never told
anyone. Perhaps this exhibition will show how important he is in
Sweden's architectural tradition.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ According to the glacial timetable on which big
exhibitions at art museums operate these days, it hasn't been
especially long, 21 years, since the last major traveling
retrospective of the 18th-century French painter Jean-Simeon
Chardin. Of course, if the world were a perfect place, a Chardin
show would be on view all the time.
</P>
<P>
   This one arrives at the Met looking much less cramped and more
luxurious than it did at its last stop, in London, on its European
tour. The unnecessary excuse is the tercentenary of Chardin's birth
in 1699. The show doesn't tell us much that was not already known,
but I can't see anything wrong with being reminded occasionally of
what great painting is.
</P>
<P>
   Every great painter is great by some terms or other, Watteau's
terms differing from Courbet's, Ingres' from Kandinsky's. Chardin
was as great as any artist by the terms he set for himself, which
were incredibly circumscribed: for almost his whole career,
spanning half a century, nearly every minute of it spent in Paris,
Chardin focused on what was not much farther than 3 or 4 feet in
front of his nose. He painted the same brown crockery, some fruit,
eggs and dead rabbits, sometimes mingled with French maids and
scrubbed children whose calm and immobility harmonized with the
inanimate things around them.
</P>
<P>
   These people seem arrested in motion, suspended, which can put
you in mind of the people in Vermeer's paintings except that
Chardin's people look more real than Vermeer's. They are absorbed
and inward turning, oblivious of us. When a little girl glances in
a mirror while her mother adjusts her bonnet, or when a nurse,
balancing a long-handled saucepan against her arm, peels a
hard-boiled egg, Chardin somehow makes these instants seem to
stretch toward infinity, assuming sudden gravity.
</P>
<P>
   In the process he conveys both the sensation of glimpsing
something unremarkable and the effect of having that glimpse
impressed on the mind as a memory. This memory, because it is
vivid, mysteriously takes a place in the imagination out of
proportion to its significance, like a smell or some notes of music
or a breeze that triggers the recollection of a childhood game or a
trip or a lost relative. It stays there, waiting.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Proust loved Chardin so much. ``You have already
experienced it subconsciously,'' he wrote, ``this pleasure one gets
from the sight of everyday scenes and inanimate objects, otherwise
it would not have risen in your heart when Chardin summoned it in
his ringing commanding accents. But your consciousness was too
sluggish to reach down to it. It had to wait for Chardin to come
and lay hold on it and hoist in to the level of your conscious
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right (Proust is always right), although I'm not sure
Chardin exactly rings out with commanding accents, being moderate
and soft-spoken, and I would add that beyond just pointing out what
is already there, he uncovered a deeper truth in nature, one that
reveals itself slowly in his work. It has to do with the interplay
of color and rhyming form, which suggests a fundamental order in
the world, something immensely reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Smoker's Case,'' for example, it exists in the
right-facing L formed by the opened lid of the rosewood case next
to the left-facing L formed by the porcelain cup and pot. A third
and larger L is made by the thick horizontal slab of the table and
the corner of the wall behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Formal balance then becomes poetry with the abrupt diagonal of
the slender pipe, the picture's exclamation point, the point of
which is a tiny speck of red in the pipe's bowl, a flame from which
tendrils of wispy smoke drift up: movement within stillness. Added
to this are the corresponding reflections of silver cup, crystal
flask, silver cap and copper goblet, ovals doing a kind of call and
response across the picture plane, the image punctuated by delicate
blue and rose designs on the pasty white porcelain, fireworks in
Chardin's tamped-down context.
</P>
<P>
   Quietude and deliberation. These were essential ingredients for
Chardin, who didn't tell stories or anecdotes. There was no real
symbolism in his work, either, no fancy allusions, and above all no
sex. A scallion was a scallion was a scallion. This was chaste and
humble painting emerging from the most erotic, opulent and
rhetorically extravagant era in the history of European painting,
exemplified by the perfumed virtuosity of a compatriot and nearly
exact contemporary like Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   The art of Chardin, by contrast with so much Rococo art, was
about love, not sex, a big difference. The sheets stayed pressed in
his pictures. If an eroticism existed, we may sense it as dense
pigment: thick, painstakingly built-up paint, which can have a
sensual charge.
</P>
<P>
   Call it understatement. Chardin was the best still life painter
ever because he made the most of the least. Sometimes he achieved a
huge impact with empty space. ``Girl With Shuttlecock'' is a figure
silhouetted against a bare wall. Her outline is a triangle
complicated by a stray strand of ribbon and the feathers of the
shuttlecock, very spare.
</P>
<P>
   Even more minimalist is ``A Mallard Drake Hanging on a Wall and
a Seville Orange.'' The space behind the picture plane is shallow
and ambiguous, as it often seems with Chardin. The duck is head
down; the body is hung from the upper left of the picture, one wing
collapsed at a right angle from the body so that the whole thing
forms a kind of calligraphic sign against a plain backdrop. This
shape is offset by the orange in the lower right corner: painted
haiku. The trajectory that exists from Chardin to Cezanne and
Matisse, who both revered him, derives from this perfect mastery of
abstract form pared down.
</P>
<P>
   All writers about Chardin invariably point out that his
pictorial family consists of the cups and pans that reappear in one
painting after another, decade after decade. We recognize them
throughout the 66 works in this exhibition as friends sharing a
comforting universe where nothing ever changes and no one ever dies
_ except hares whose death in Chardin's hands becomes more a state
of grace than morbidity. We're given the signs of rigor mortis and
blood stains on the fur.
</P>
<P>
   Chardin's attendance to their condition and by extension our
attendance can be so loving and complete that it approaches
transference. We can fully believe this is what it's like to be a
rabbit, and the association, even though it's a little crazy,
elicits empathy.
</P>
<P>
   Dead rabbits and likewise dead fish: Cartier-Bresson, the
photographer, who draws copies of Chardins at the Louvre, has
pointed out about the famous dead ray hanging gutted from a hook
that it looks like it's crucified. This dovetails with Proust's
equally fantastic metaphor for the ray as ``the nave of a
polychrome cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Chardin that even his pictures of food make
people speculate about God?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect it has to do with the particular quality of his
silence. These are pictures of an extraordinary hushed reverence
for the dignity of modest things, for paint's ability to simulate
those things, and for a viewer's elevation through extended looking
at those things. With Chardin one loses track of time staring at a
bunch of cherries, wondering at their translucence, then counting
the cherries _ there are five _ and noticing that five matches the
sum of two peaches, a green apple and two sections of a split
apricot to create perfect symmetry.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny observation, but like many simple facts of life strangely
marvelous when it turns out to be a key to some greater truth.
Chardin's work is a compilation of these little facts that together
make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the
history of art.

&HT;     ARCHBISHOP KNOWN FOR HIS OPENNESS, GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Roman Catholic Archbishop Patrick Flores' personal
philosophy, emblazoned on his episcopal coat of arms, offers one of
the best insights into why he was so easily taken hostage
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laborabo non mihi se omnibus,'' the motto reads in Latin. ``I
will not work for myself, but for others.''
</P>
<P>
   With an open-door policy at his chancery office, Flores
routinely welcomes a steady stream of visitors, receiving all of
them _ the rich and powerful and the poor and oppressed _ with the
same gentle mixture of grace, humility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   As the hostage drama played out over nine hours Wednesday at the
archbishop's office in San Antonio, friends, co-workers,
acquaintances and many people who did not even know Flores paused
to pray and reflect on the cleric fondly known as the ``Mariachi
Bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores, 71, was not harmed during the ordeal. He was released
from a hospital Thursday and church officials said he was resting.
</P>
<P>
   The police charged Nelson Antonio Escolero, 40, an El Salvadoran
national who has lived in the United States for years, with
aggravated kidnapping. Escolero, whose wife and three children are
U.S. citizens, told the police he was distraught that a pending
charge of driving with a suspended license could get him deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first word you think of when you think of Patrick Flores
is kindness,'' said Tom Frost, senior chairman of Cullen/Frost
Bankers Inc., who has known the archbishop more than 30 years. ``I
think he's been one of the most significant forces for good in this
community that I've seen in my adult life.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Lyons, 16, met Flores five years ago when she and her
choir sang for him during a visit to her middle school. On
Wednesday, Lyons, now a high school junior, went to the San
Fernando Cathedral, the official seat of the diocese, to pray for
Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me and my classmates a hug,'' Lyons recalled. ``I'll
never forget that.''

the odds to become the first Mexican-American Catholic bishop,
Flores never lost his love for the people he vowed to serve. It was
a love forged from personal hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Patricio Flores was born on May 26, 1929, in the tiny South
Texas farming community of Ganado, one of 10 children. The family
migrated between Robstown and Amarillo every year, picking cotton
and rice. Lagging behind in school due to his family's frequent
moves, Flores dropped out in the tenth grade after his father fell
ill.
</P>
<P>
   The future archbishop sang in several Houston-area beer halls
until some soul searching put him on the path to the priesthood.
The pastor of Flores' church tried to discourage him, saying,
``Mexicans don't make it anyway.'' But a sympathetic nun, Sister
Mary Benetia Vermeersch, brought the 17-year-old to the attention
of Christopher Byrne, who was then bishop of the diocese of
Galveston and Houston. With Byrne's personal financial and
spiritual support, Flores completed three years of high school
coursework in two years and then entered St. Mary's Seminary in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Flores was ordained a priest in 1956. During the 1960s, he
served in several Houston parishes and became active in PADRES, a
group of Hispanic priests that pushed for the appointment of a
Hispanic bishop. They got their wish in 1970 when the Vatican, much
to Flores' surprise, made him its first Mexican-American bishop,
working as an auxiliary to then Archbishop Francis J. Furey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, while attending a bishop's conference in Ecuador,
Flores and four other Mexican-American prelates were taken into
custody at gunpoint by the army. They were later released unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Flores was named bishop of El Paso, only to return to
San Antonio as archbishop 15 months later after Furey's death from
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Milestones of Flores' years in the top post include Pope John
Paul II's visit to the Alamo City in 1987. He also co-founded the
Mexican-American Cultural Center as a school for Hispanic pastoral
ministry, helped stanch declining enrollment in San Antonio's
Catholic schools and established the nation's first Catholic
diocesan television station.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers speculate that Flores could become the first
Hispanic cardinal, a theory Flores has dismissed. Flores plans to
stay in office until July 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Equally fluent in English and Spanish, Flores loves to tell
stories and jokes from the pulpit, but he never shies away from
controversy on behalf of poor people, unborn babies, undocumented
workers and death-row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Well-wishes came from all over the world last year when Flores
celebrated his celebrated his 70th birthday. San Antonio auto and
real estate magnate B.J. ``Red'' McCombs served as the chairman of
Flores' birthday bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``His life, all of his life, is his service to others,'' McCombs
said Wednesday. ``There's not any question about that.''

UH, GEE, ROCKY, DE NIRO'S REMAKE OF KITSCHY CULT FAVE IS PRETTY
GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B

<P>
   Unlikely as it may seem, Robert De Niro is said to be an
obsessive fan of the old Rocky and Bullwinkle television cartoon
show, and has apparently spent much of the '90s patiently trying to
secure the rights and put together his own big-screen version.
</P>
<P>
   The root of this obsession is not clear _ he's not been
forthcoming on the subject _ and no doubt his biographers will be
debating the matter for decades to come. Perhaps his ``rosebud'' as
an actor is buried within its absurdity. Perhaps it just tickles
his funny bone.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever has made the superstar spend nearly 10 years on the
project, his dedication has resulted in one of the better would-be
blockbusters of the summer of '00. It's often surprisingly clever,
dripping with respect for its model, and done with considerable wit
and style.
</P>
<P>
   The original animated series, ``Rocky and his Friends'' (later
retitled ``The Bullwinkle Show''), which ran between 1959 and 1964,
chronicled _ among numerous other characters _ the adventures of a
do-gooder flying squirrel, Rocky, and his ultra-dumb moose
sidekick, Bullwinkle: an undynamic duo that was often at odds with
an Eastern European spy couple named Boris and Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   It was drawn in the era's junkiest kind of ``limited'' TV
animation, but creator Jay Ward put much effort into the writing
and gradually developed a unique ``bad'' humor for the show that
went right over the heads of the kiddies to gather a large adult
following: groan-inducing puns, silly satiric gags, unbelievably
corny one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   This big-screen version generally succeeds in re-creating that
humor in a story that has the animated duo pressed into service
after a 35-year retirement. Their mission: to help the FBI stop the
post-Cold War Boris and Natasha from taking over America by means
of RB (``Really Bad'') TV, a network so unspeakably dumb that it
turns viewers into zombies.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that Boris, Natasha and their controller, Fearless
Leader, have _ through some esoteric computer glitch _ taken on
human form, while Rocky and Bullwinkle remain animated. So the
movie is very much a ``Roger Rabbit''-affair, with the
three-dimensional cartoon heroes operating in a live-action world.
</P>
<P>
   To make this difficult transition, producer De Niro has hired
Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote the hit 1999 De Niro-Billy Crystal
comedy, ``Analyze This.'' For the most part, the writer has risen
to the task with an occasionally very funny, shamelessly
pun-riddled script that plays off our affection for the old series
and constantly pokes fun at the nostalgic folly of the filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Director Des McAnuff _ a Tony-winning Broadway veteran whose
only previous movie was the 1998 adaptation of Balzac's ``Cousin
Bette'' _ is yet a third unlikely purveyor of baby-boomer kitsch,
but he also gets in the spirit, adds several inspired touches and
has resisted any pressure there might have been to upgrade the old
Jay Ward-style of animation with a Disneyesque lushness.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro gives himself the showiest part, Fearless Leader,
playing it as if he had understudied Laurence Olivier in ``The
Prince and the Showgirl.'' Jason Alexander and Rene Russo are also
suitably broad and silly as Boris and Natasha.
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, the movie ``Rocky and Bullwinkle''
manages to be a worthy tribute to the TV classic in every respect
except one: It lacks the original's brevity. While the Rocky and
Bullwinkle segments were only five or 10 minutes of a half-hour
show, this movie goes on for 88 minutes. Its first act is
delightful, but it just doesn't have the juice to sustain a feature
length and finally becomes redundant and tiresome.
</P>

   BENNINGTON, Vt. _ Beyond providing an excuse to indulge in hot
dogs and fireworks, the Fourth of July weekend can still call to
mind the struggle around the event the holiday commemorates, the
signing of the Declaration of Independence. So perhaps a town like
Bennington, whose ambience runs from the workaday to the artsy,
should count itself fortunate to have so visible a reminder of
Revolutionary valor.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Bennington Battle Monument, a limestone shaft
that does double duty, commemorating the Battle of Bennington in
1777 and providing a perch to which visitors can ascend for
impressive views of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Reminders of revolutionary glory are only one diversion in
southwestern Vermont, a place rich in recreational opportunities
(the Appalachian Trail runs through the area) and in its
association with famous people, from poets to the kin of
presidents. Robert Frost is buried in Bennington. Mary Todd Lincoln
spent summers in nearby Manchester, which is also the site of a
mansion built by Robert Todd Lincoln, her son.
</P>
<P>
   I've felt the lure of the area since I lived in western
Massachusetts, where I worked for a local newspaper in the early
1980s. Driving up to Bennington seemed like a pleasant escape.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as then, there are two ways to get around. Those who value
speed can take Route 7, a highway connecting Bennington to
Manchester, 20 miles north. But why go fast when there is so much
to see?
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip, my wife, Margaret, and I took the slow road,
Route 7A, a two-laner that rises and dips across the rural
landscape. We made our base in Arlington, a village that briefly
served as Vermont's capital after the Revolution. Fortunately, the
legislators have long since departed, leaving the place quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Because we liked the description in a guidebook, we booked a
room at the Arlington Inn, a mid-19th-century Greek Revival mansion
with a lawn fronting the main road. It turned out to be a very good
choice; the friendly and responsive staff treated us and our
toddler son with down-to-earth good cheer. From there we ambled
around the countryside, admiring its many shades of green, and even
found a couple of covered bridges, one not far from the inn.
</P>
<P>
   But we had some specific goals in mind, one being the Bennington
Battlefield State Historic Site. Visiting it brings a surprise, as
the site lies in New York, just across the Vermont line, on a small
but steep hill. The British forces involved in the fighting had
been heading for Bennington, on orders from Gen. John Burgoyne, to
seize American supplies. Burgoyne's subordinate, Lt. Col. Friedrich
Baum, made it only as far as a hill above the Walloomsac River,
where he dug in.
</P>
<P>
   The high ground did him little good. His troops were overwhelmed
on Aug. 16, 1777, by American forces under Gen. John Stark, a
veteran of Bunker Hill. Baum died in the battle, as did 200 of his
men. Vermont's militia, led by Seth Warner, saved the day by
chasing off British reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   Burgoyne, leading an army south from Canada in an effort to
separate New England from the rest of the colonies, complained that
Vermonters were ``the most rebellious race on the continent.'' He
met his final defeat two months later, at Saratoga, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As for Warner, he is honored by a statue in front of the battle
monument, built a century ago at the site of the supply house the
British had hoped to take. A mile west of Bennington's downtown, in
a community called Old Bennington, the 306-foot tower contains an
upper floor that visitors can reach by elevator. Narrow windows
offer views in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Look south and you get a clear view of Mount Greylock, the
highest point in Massachusetts. In the same direction, virtually in
the tower's shadow, is the First Congregational Church, known
locally as Old First. Completed in 1806, it is every inch the
traditional white New England clapboard church-on-the-green.
</P>
<P>
   We first saw it illuminated by spotlights after nightfall _ a
stunning sight _ as we drove into Bennington on Route 9 from
Albany. The burial ground behind the church contains Robert Frost's
grave, as well as the resting places of Revolutionary soldiers and
several Vermont governors. The cemetery is one of several old
graveyards in the vicinity bearing headstones with elaborate
carvings of hourglasses and angels' heads and homespun couplets
that were common in 18th-century New England. One such cemetery
that is particularly worth seeing lies adjacent to Route 7A in the
village of Shaftsbury. The Green Mountains form its backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   The culture in which these stones were created favored epitaphs
that spoke of death with a bluntness now decidedly out of style. In
Shaftsbury, this inscription is carved onto the stone of one Israel
Cole, who died in 1787: ``You find the place where I am laid, To
moulder in the dust. As you must be tis only said, That I am here
the first.''
</P>
<P>
   From Shaftsbury it's a few miles to the busier streets of
Manchester, a resort of long standing. In August 1863, Mary Todd
Lincoln brought her sons there to stay in the Equinox Hotel, which
is still very much a part of the local scene.
</P>
<P>
   LAND OF A LINCOLN
</P>
<P>
   Robert Todd Lincoln, her oldest (and the only of the Lincolns'
children to reach adulthood) would later return to Manchester in a
very big way. In 1902, a successful corporate lawyer, he bought 500
acres southeast of town and built a grand summer home, which he
called Hildene. A Georgian Revival mansion, it sits atop high
ground, with formal gardens and a generous view of the valley
below.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For the last two decades it has been owned and managed by the
Friends of Hildene, a nonprofit preservationist group that bought
it for $200,000 from the Christian Science Church, which had
acquired it as a bequest from the last of the Lincoln descendants
to live there, Mary ``Peggy'' Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is open for tours from May to October, pretty much
the time of year that Robert Lincoln's family was in residence.
</P>
<P>
   Our guide told us that Mary Beckwith, an animal lover who kept
the mansion full of dogs and cats, was venturesome enough to learn
to fly but so reticent in public that it took Pat Nixon (then wife
of the vice president) several phone calls to persuade her to come
to Virginia in 1960 to christen a Navy submarine named for Abraham
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the mansion strongly reflects the presence of
the younger Lincoln. Although he wore a beard in later life, he
looked little like his presidential father, to judge by a portrait
that hangs in the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been easy being the son of the martyred savior
of the Union. And there does not seem to be much in Robert
Lincoln's public life to appeal to idealists. Twenty-two years old
when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, he became a lawyer in
Chicago, establishing a base of corporate clients that included the
Pullman railroad car company; he became the company's president in
1897, only a few years after the concern had crushed its workers in
the great Pullman strike.
</P>
<P>
   He never sought elective office but twice served in Republican
administrations, as secretary of war and later as ambassador to
Great Britain. In Manchester, he played golf daily.
</P>
<P>
   What a visitor sees at Hildene is a life lived at very great
remove from the hardscrabble frontier existence Americans associate
with the young Abraham Lincoln. Robert Lincoln represented a
Republican Party leadership more privileged than populist, more
comfortable with William Howard Taft (who visited during his
unsuccessful re-election campaign in 1912) than with Teddy
Roosevelt. Robert Lincoln already owned a substantial house in
Chicago when he built Hildene, a mansion with 24 rooms. ``He was a
railroad baron, all right,'' our guide remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mansion has a homey rather than an imperial air. The
rooms are attractively designed but not grand. The library, from
which Robert Lincoln ran the Pullman company when he was at
Hildene, is small but inviting, decorated with portraits of Abraham
Lincoln. The parlor nearby is painted a rose red that Robert
Lincoln's wife, Mary, liked.
</P>
<P>
   After the visit we walked around Manchester, where a
neighborhood of stately homes leads up to the town's commercial
center, the Equinox Hotel on one side and the county courthouse,
with its gold-colored cupola, on the other. The Lure of Exploring
</P>
<P>
   It all seemed very busy and prosperous, the street humming with
cars and people bustling off to lunch, the golf course or upscale
outlet stores. One could probably settle in pretty comfortably and
perhaps not venture elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But if we had done that, we would have missed any number of
things _ like finding out just how cooling it is to be inside the
battle monument on a very hot day, or discovering that, upon
stopping in Shaftsbury, the loudest sound we heard was birdsong.
</P>
<P>
   And I would have been sorry to have missed the odd tree we found
outside our inn in Arlington, the one with a split trunk, an
opening just wide enough for a 2-year-old to squeeze through and
feel as if he was having an adventure. Our son liked that a lot,
and it made for some good pictures.

   In the third in this week's grab-bag series of campaign
proposals, Al Gore, in Chicago today, proposed $25 billion in
mass-transit subsidies meant to clean up smog and traffic. He
underscored that his ``new-way-of-thinking'' environmental agenda
won't force drivers onto the bus or train: ``Don't tell me that
there's a great groundswell to get rid of cars and to push people
into mass transit whether they want it or not. That's the old,
tired way of thinking; the new way of thinking is, hey, give people
a choice.'' This proposal was dubbed ``Keep America Moving''
initiative.
</P>
<P>
   PUTTING OUT CONTRACTS?
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican congressmen _ Christopher Shays of Connecticut
and Peter Hoekstra of Michigan _ want Al Gore to answer allegations
that federal contracts went to the Teamsters to influence their
presidential endorsement. The New York Times had quoted anonymous
Gore advisers as saying projects were directed through federal
agencies that would use Teamsters in an effort to keep the union
from endorsing Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. ``This statement,
if true, is an illegal act,'' said Shays. The Gore campaign and
Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ELIAN ISSUE OFF THE FRONT BURNER
</P>
<P>
   With 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez back in Cuba, George W. Bush said
he was ``saddened'' and Al Gore said the Supreme Court's refusal to
intervene is ``entitled to respect.'' Gore had argued for the case
to be turned over to a family court. He also parted company with
the Clinton administration by supporting legislation to grant
permanent resident status to the boy, his father and other
relatives. That move was criticized as political pandering to
Cuban-Americans. Bush also favored a family court hearing, and had
wanted the administration to try to persuade the father and son to
stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   E-MAIL TO BACKERS: SEND MONEY
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is raising money for a final pre-convention TV ad
blitz. ``Please click on my Web site and contribute to my
campaign,'' he wrote in an e-mail to supporters. ``Every cent will
go to TV ads to let Americans know what I would do as president.''
Bush cannot spend privately raised money after he becomes the
official GOP presidential nominee at the July 31-Aug. 3 convention.
At that point, he will get $67.6 million in taxpayer money to run
his fall campaign. Al Gore will get the same. Bush has raised more
than $90 million, had $7.1 million left at the end of May, and
continues to raise more.
</P>
<P>
   NOW IT'S UP TO PEROT TO DECIDE
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of Ross Perot says he's gained enough signatures to
qualify the Texas billionaire for the Reform Party's presidential
primary ballot in an effort to block Pat Buchanan. But Perot, who
has until midnight Friday to accept or reject the ballot spot,
wasn't indicating what he'd do. With just over a day left until the
deadline, Ira Goodman of New Jersey said backers have received
qualifying signatures from enough states to satisfy party rules.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITAL CASES PILING UP ON BUSH
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a swing to court minority voters, George W.
Bush is facing another clemency decision, this one in a death
penalty case marked by allegations of racial bias. The case of
Jessy San Miguel has not attracted as much mainstream media
attention as Gary Graham, who was executed last week. That's
because San Miguel, 28, has long admitted to the brutal slaying of
four people in a Taco Bell shop in 1991. Spanish-language media,
however, has focused on the role race may have played in San
Miguel's death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   GEE,THIS GUY'S REALLY ANGRY
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) sent a second letter to Al Gore
demanding an apology for a comment by his spokesman, Chris Lehane,
accusing Specter of using ``McCarthyite tactics.'' ``Since you have
not responded to my (first) letter and your surrogates are
repeating their outlandish, defamatory statements, if your campaign
intends to continue your character assassination of me, I think you
ought to be man enough to say it yourself.'' Specter had disclosed
a Justice Department official's recommendation of a special counsel
to probe Gore's statements in connection with 1996 fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   WHICH DIRECTION THE FEAR?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton defended her two-week-long wave of attacks on
Rick Lazio, asserting that she was simply trying to highlight
contrasts between the two Senate candidates, and disputing Lazio's
contention that she was orchestrating a campaign based on fear. ``I
don't think the congressman has anything to fear from me; I think
the only thing he has to fear is his own record,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO `ARRIVE': USE MONEY
</P>
<P>
   Hosting a mostly black crowd of new and second-generation
immigrants from Africa at a $1,000-a-person fund-raiser in
Washington, Al Gore noted the event raised $350,000 for the
Democratic National Committee. ``That is a sign that this group has
really entered a brand new relationship to the national politics of
our country,'' he said. He added that ``as Irish-Americans have
been able to focus the attention of our policy makers,'' so, too,
would this group be able ``to play its proper role in helping to
focus the attention of our country on issues in Nigeria or Ethiopia
or Ghana or Cameroon or South Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRING AN ANTI-GUN BARRAGE AT CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   A national gun control organization that has displayed thousands
of gunshot victims' shoes around the country is planning an
advertising blitz and special shows of shoes during the Republican
convention in Philadelphia. The organization, Silent March, says
its ads against guns will appear on 100 city buses and 50 subway
trains from July 31 through Aug. 3, though convention managers
currently have no plans to make an issue of gun control. ``These
advertisements are a wake-up call to the Republican Party,'' said
Ellen Freudenheim of Silent March.

GOETHE AND THE LURE OF ITALIAN VISTAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Exhibition notes at end of review.) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the virtues of the small Dahesh Museum, young
but with both feet planted in tradition, is its mounting of
academic theme and individual shows involving minor yet sometimes
significant artists that would be hard to come by elsewhere. The
museum has grown (if not physically, at least in aesthetic stature)
since its rocky beginning in Manhattan five years ago when its
exhibition policy was based on the kitschy 19th-century academic
paintings acquired by its founding father, a Lebanese philosophical
writer and art collector (1909-1984) known by his adopted moniker,
Dr. Dahesh, which means ``inspiring wonder'' in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   But after the first three shows of its own collection, the
museum decided to broaden its program. Under the direction of J.
David Farmer, an art historian, it began to bring in shows and
borrow works to complement its own. As its ambitions have
developed, the Dahesh _ maybe the only museum in America with a
wall-to-wall program of 19th-century traditional academic art
(eschewing Impressionism as too avant-garde) _ has gained in
credibility among its institutional colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally we really had to go out and find stuff, but now
it's coming to us,'' said Farmer. What's more, for the first time
in its short history, the museum earlier this year organized its
own show, ``Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the Academie
Julian,'' which celebrated the pioneering role of the Parisian art
school in training women. Breaking attendance records at the
Dahesh, the show was the first the museum was able to circulate.
</P>
<P>
   The Dahesh would like to spread its wings in the building at 2
Columbus Circle, erected by Huntington Hartford and most recently
occupied by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs. It
has put in a bid for the building. But meanwhile, it is carrying on
in its cramped Midtown quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Its current show, ``In the Footsteps of Goethe: Paintings and
Drawings from German Collections'' is the first exhibition to focus
on 19th-century landscape painting in Italy by Germans affiliated
with the influential Duesseldorf Academy of Art _ an important
center for traditional academic art training _ during its golden
age, 1829-1865. It runs through Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 plein-air sketches _ done on site and concentrating
on Rome and its environs _ by teachers and students of the Academy
are on view, ranging from ink-and-pencil drawings to finished oils.
The show was organized last year by Dr. Martina Stitt, curator of
the Kunsthalle in Hamburg, to celebrate the 250th birthday of the
writer, art collector and polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
(1749-1832). The Dahesh is its only United States stop.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of Italy for young German artists was much enhanced by
Goethe's widely read ``Italian Journey,'' an artistic-philosophical
diary of his sojourn there in the 1780s, first published in full in
1829. German artists had worked in Italy before, most notably the
Nazarenes, a group of early 19th-century painters in Rome keen on
reviving the purity of Christian expression in early Renaissance
art. The history of German painters in Rome usually ends with the
departure of the Nazarenes in the early 1830s. But new research has
tracked the German presence in Italy to the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the contributions of the first wave of Goethe-inspired
followers to the development of European landscape was the
proliferation of the plein-air sketch, done directly from nature.
Such sketches were regarded only as notes for finished work, but
they later came to be accepted as finished paintings in themselves
by more progressive artists, notably the Impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   The charismatic Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow (1788-1862), a
history painter who was part of the Nazarene group, headed the
Duesseldorf Academy. It drew not only European but American
students, William Stanley Haseltine and Worthington Whittredge
among them, during its peak years, from 1826 to 1859. Von Schadow
revered Italy, made several lengthy visits to Rome and was joined
there by his students.
</P>
<P>
   What these northern artists loved about Italy besides its
centrality to classical civilization were the picturesque ruins;
beautiful vistas in the campagnas around Rome, Naples and Sicily;
the architecture of Roman houses and monuments, gardens, woods,
walls, hill towns; and above all the profusion of light that bathed
everything in a golden glow.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more talented and prolific of the Duesseldorf painters
was Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (1807-1863), who in 1839 became
professor of landscape painting at the Academy. He was known for
his offbeat perspectives and ability to register rapid changes of
light. The artist most represented in the show, his contributions
range from the beautifully lighted oil sketch ``At Tivoli, View
Below the Villa d'Este'' (1840), a peek through heavy foliage at a
grand structure, to the highly finished ``Italian Forest
Landscape'' (1842). Completed two years after his return from
Italy, it is a big, romantic close-up view of a forest through
which two travelers make their way toward an idyllic destination
that dazzles with its light.
</P>
<P>
   Schirmer's landscape students in Duesseldorf included the Swiss
symbolist Arnold Boecklin (1827-1901), who made Rome his base from
1850 to 1857. A low-key Boecklin view of the Roman Campagna from
that time is included in the show, ``Pontine Marshes'' (1851), a
clump of foliage on rocky ground backed by an idyllic cloudscape.
One of the few paintings with figures is a large, too-bright oil by
Caspar Scheuren (1810-1887), ``Monks at the Italian Sea'' (1846),
depicting men of the cloth on a balcony, looking out over a
campanile at a stretch of blue sea illuminated by a startling
pinkish-orange light.
</P>
<P>
   The show abounds in pencil sketches, too. Although most are
notes for landscape paintings or architectural studies, one
charming, undated work by Carl Andreae (1823-1904) depicts five
friends and colleagues at the German Archaeological Institute. A
strongly rendered lineup of profiles, it gives a lively character
reading for each face. A more exuberant sketch by a Nazarene, Peter
Cornelius (1783-1867), ``Festival of German Artists in Rome''
(1835) gives the rowdy flavor of life among the Duesseldorfers when
not at their easels.
</P>
<P>
   Fleshing out a little-known area of German art, ``In the
Footsteps of Goethe'' is a worthwhile show. The Dahesh is beginning
to prove that among its fast-stepping sister museums on the New
York scene, there is a place for one devoted to the arriere-garde.
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBITION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Footsteps of Goethe: Paintings and Drawings From German
Collections'' is at the Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Ave., at 48th
Street, (212) 759-0606, until Aug. 19.

 &HT;    TAXING INTERNET SALES GAINING FAVOR IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last month, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved
a bill to block new taxes on the Internet for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of moving smoothly through the Senate as expected,
the tax moratorium bill has stalled, and legislation intended to
help states collect taxes on online transactions is gaining
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales tax is the backbone of most state budgets and the
foundation for the funding of education, police, fire and
transportation needs in our communities,'' Rep. Spencer Bachus,
R-Ala., said Thursday at a House subcommittee hearing on his bill.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress lets states tax out-of-state merchants who reach
customers in cyberspace, ``Internet retailers will continue to
enjoy a tax haven, while brick and mortar retailers will pay higher
and higher taxes to make up for the revenues lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many congressional staff members and lobbyists say the the
Bachus bill, and a similar measure in the Senate sponsored by Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., probably won't have time to make it all the
way to President Clinton's desk this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the pro-tax bills may be gaining enough momentum to stymie
efforts in the Senate to pass a five-year extension of the current
moratorium on Internet access taxes, as the House did in May.
</P>
<P>
   The moratorium lasts until October 2001, and many lobbyists
expect Congress to put the matter off until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes are in force in 45 states, but states cannot force a
company with no in-state store or warehouse to collect taxes. That
means online merchants and catalog companies generally collect
taxes only from in-state customers.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the University of Tennessee has projected that as
electronic commerce grows, states will eventually lose more than
$10 billion annually from untaxed transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-tax forces have been lobbying Congress heavily to
prevent such a loss. They include not only state and local
officials, but traditional retailers who say they are being put at
an unfair competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey suggests tax policy does tend to shift business
away from Main Street. Fifty-seven percent of home Internet users
said they took sales taxes into consideration when making
purchases, according to a poll by PC Data Online.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents of taxing online sales say merchants would be
unduly burdened by the maze of arcane rules in thousands of tax
jurisdictions coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax advocates respond by saying states should be given the
time and encouragement to created simple and uniform tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bachus and Dorgan want Congress to help states form
compacts with common tax regimes. While state and local governments
impose sales taxes, Congress would have to give its blessing to
joint tax collection plans.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
commercial and administrative law, Bachus said his bill would
``provide a framework for simplification and allow states to
require (tax) collection when the simplification process has been
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say states will never be able to coordinate their tax
policies well enough to create a single compact, but the National
Governors Association says it needs only a couple of years to
develop a uniform tax system under which shoppers would pay the
same taxes, whether buying in stores, by mail or on the Internet.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: 3rd generation Rotarian fulfils
the American legacy
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Jayne A. McCurry was installed Thursday as
president of the Angelina County Rotary Club, the third generation
of her family to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a generation ago such a thing wouldn't have been
possible _ a woman being a member of what was exclusively a male
organization. Best she could have hoped for was president of Rotary
Ann, the woman's auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   But things change.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I attended installation ceremonies as guests of Elma
Alexander, proud mother of the new Rotary president.
</P>
<P>
   We knew her late husband, Lefty Alexander, president of the
Lufkin Rotary Club in 1973. I remember, too, Mrs. Alexander's
father, Al Cudlipp Sr., one of our leading industrialists, founding
president of Lufkin Rotary some 75 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Thursday's luncheon meeting, Joe Byrd, himself a retired
industrialist-inventor who is known as Lufkin's ``Mr. Rotary,''
served as master of ceremonies. Joe was a founding member of the
Angelina Rotary, a spin-off of Lufkin Rotary, 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell you most everything Rotary that's ever happened. A
lot of it he told at Thursday's installation.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite part -- and I had all but forgotten it -- was in
1953 when Lefty Alexander brought Western movie star Wild Bill
Elliott to Lufkin.
</P>
<P>
   Wild Bill was here to pick up a horse trailer he had ordered
from Lufkin Trailers. Lefty headed up the trailer plant. Next thing
you knew, Lefty had Wild Bill, all decked out in Western duds and
wearing his six-guns, speaking to the Rotary Club's noon luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   When word got out that Wild Bill was in town, the schools let
out early so that youngsters might catch a glimpse of one of their
film heroes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Wild Bill was a Rotarian himself, but he would
have fit right in, straight-shooter that he was, especially with
Rotary's Four-Way Test ``of the things we think, say or do.''
</P>
<P>
   1. Is it the truth?
</P>
<P>
   2. Is it fair to all concerned?
</P>
<P>
   3. Will it build goodwill and better friendships?
</P>
<P>
   4. Will it be beneficial to all concerned?
</P>
<P>
   The Rotary Club serves as a hero figure throughout much of the
world. It's good works, channeled through the Rotary Foundation,
are calculated in hundreds of millions of dollars aiding millions
of needy people each year, feeding the hungry and providing medical
help for the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Civic clubs throughout the country, whether in small towns or
big cities, are doing their share and more, with book drives, blood
drives, organ donor drives and all sorts of worthy causes _ all
driven by a conscientious effort for community improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Al Cudlipp, Lefty Alexander, Jayne McCurry . . . Some things
change, some things stay the same. In the process things get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the American legacy, one generation to the next.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year at this time, Heath Ledger was one phone call away
from packing up his bags, returning to his native Australia and
resuming what had been a successful acting career _ successful,
that is, until he came to the States.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the phone call, courtesy of director Roland Emmerich,
and Ledger was cast in the Revolutionary War epic, ``The Patriot,''
playing opposite Australian icon Mel Gibson. Now the only travel
plans Ledger makes revolve around movie projects. He's just back
from Prague, where he's making ``A Knight's Tale,'' another
medieval adventure set for a high-profile opening next summer. Next
up will be the fourth remake of the classic adventure ``The Four
Feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a 21-year-old who had been inundated with nothing
but teen movie scripts after making a strong impression last year
in ``10 Things I Hate About You.'' His name not withstanding (Heath
is short for Heathcliff; his mom has a thing for ``Wuthering
Heights''), Ledger isn't much for mush. For a year after finishing
``10 Things,'' he turned down dozens of movies aimed at the
Clearasil set, waiting for a film that he ``would be in love
with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long year,'' Ledger says, his Aussie accent still
very much intact. ``I went out for jobs that I probably shouldn't
have been going for, things that had another 30 or 40 actors ahead
of me. But I wanted to give it a shot. And I got very close on a
lot of great projects, very close, and then the rug just always was
pulled out from underneath my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledger was so determined there would be no rug-pulling with
``The Patriot'' he nearly accomplished the job himself. When he met
with Emmerich (``Independence Day,'' ``Godzilla'') and his
producing partner Dean Devlin, Ledger stopped midway through
reading a scene, apologized to the filmmakers for wasting their
time and walked out of the audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I had blown my last chance,'' Ledger says. ``And I
was tired from the whole year and I didn't feel like taking it to a
place where I'd almost get the part and then see it go to someone
else. That's why I left. But Roland and Dean must have liked
something about me; either that, or they were curious about what
kind of fool would walk out on an audition like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin admits he and Emmerich were intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Heath is that he has the one quality that's
hard to find in most young actors, and that's the quality of being
a man,'' Devlin says. ``Most 21-year-olds still feel like boys.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ledger's role in ``The Patriot'' called for a mixture of
impetuousness and composure, a blend that suits the young actor to
a tee. In the Revolutionary War film, Ledger plays Gabriel,
Gibson's headstrong son, a young man who enlists in the Continental
Army against his father's wishes. For Gabriel, patriotism comes
before family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabriel represents the new generation and has all the idealism
that goes along with that,'' Ledger says.
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind Ledger's own maturity isn't difficult to
pinpoint. After growing up in rough-and-tumble Perth and getting
his feet wet acting in local theater productions, Ledger decided to
hop in a car with his best friend and move to Sydney. He was 16 at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The train of life was just flying by and I had to jump on
it,'' Ledger says. ``I had 69 cents in my bank account and a bit of
cash that my folks gave me. Looking back, I'm amazed that my
parents were lenient and understanding about letting me follow my
dreams. But I was a kid who was going to do it anyway. It was
either going to be the hard way or the easy way and I think they
knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy way turned out to be, well, pretty easy, at least at
first. Ledger won parts on two Australian dramas and a sitcom and
then landed the lead on a short-lived, swashbuckling Fox television
series called ``Roar.'' He moved to Los Angeles when he turned 19,
and landed ``10 Things,'' winning the heart of Julia Stiles (and
young female moviegoers) playing the rogueish Patrick Verona.
</P>
<P>
   So when rejection came (and it came often after ``10 Things''),
Ledger didn't have much experience dealing with failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating, but it's all part of the journey, you
know,'' Ledger says. ``And I don't know how long this journey is
going to last, but I'm having a lot of fun right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That casual attitude trickles down to other areas of Ledger's
life, most notably his grooming and attire, which takes artful
dishevelment to new heights. Ledger's hobbies include photography
and tap dancing, the latter a nod to his movie hero, Gene Kelly.
His dream assignment would be to remake one of Kelly's old films,
with ``The Pirate'' being his top choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly wasn't the greatest actor and he wasn't a great
singer,'' Ledger says. ``But boy could he dance. And he had such a
strong spirit. He could bring light to the screen and just fill it
up. I remind myself of his spirit sometimes when I need to push
through on a particular scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledger may have been thinking of Kelly when he showed up on the
first day of shooting for ``The Patriot.'' He admits he was
initially ``hopeless,'' and needed to grab hold of any inspiration
he could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see he had a reverence for Mel because Mel is so big
in Australia,'' Emmerich says. ``I think Heath went home that first
day a nervous wreck; he was so disappointed in himself. But he was
actually pretty good that day, although you wouldn't be able to
tell him that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, you wouldn't. Ledger calls himself his ``own worst critic,''
but he cuts himself some slack, too, saying that he calmed down
once Gibson put him at ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I just soaked up as much information as I could,''
Ledger says. ``Mel is a lovely, lovely man, and that's surprising
because I know not everyone in his position is as friendly as he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ledger's own position is loftier, he's being courted
for some more high-profile projects, including the ``Spider-Man''
feature film. But Ledger says he's not cut out to be an action
star.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't really interest me,'' Ledger says. ``Too many
action movies are just slapped together and the action always comes
before the story. Look at the last `Star Wars.' It just sucked. It
seemed like it was created just to sell merchandise and video
games. That's not the kind of thing I want to waste my time with.''

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ An overloaded ferry appears to have sunk in
heavy seas Thursday, and officials said they feared the loss of
nearly 500 people, many of whom were fleeing religion-based
killings in the remote Maluku Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Radio contact was lost after the wooden-hulled ship, the Cahaya
Bahari, reported that it was taking on water in heavy seas at about
1 p.m. The officials said that when rescue efforts were called off
at dark, about five hours later, no trace had been found of the
ship or of any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry was lost about 40 miles from land on its route from
Halmahera island, where as many as 200 Christian villagers were
killed a week earlier in continuing fighting between Christians and
Muslims. It was heading for Manado, the capital of the neighboring
province of North Sulawesi, about 1,500 miles northeast of the
capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, which was licensed to carry about 250 passengers, had
492 people aboard, including 290 refugees from the massacre at
Halmahera, said an official with the National Search and Rescue
Agency. He said there were 186 other passengers and 16 crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials reached by telephone told news agencies that they
believed that the ferry had sunk. ``Of course, we are afraid many
people have died,'' said Ering Musa, a local maritime official.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that several vessels had reached the site
where the ship had apparently gone down, but that their search was
hampered by fog and six-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling archipelago of thousands of islands, Indonesia is
linked by a network of ferries, many of which are poorly maintained
and regularly carry far more than their legal load. Disasters are
common.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Cahaya Bahari was particularly overloaded because
of the panic caused by the fighting, which has killed more than
2,500 people over the last 18 months and has driven thousands of
people to flee to neighboring provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In Ambon, the capital of the Maluku Islands, people reported
that the latest surge of terror continued Thursday despite a state
of emergency declared on Monday by President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Although running street battles between Muslim and Christian
gangs appeared to have abated, they said, the continuing sounds of
gunfire and bomb blasts and the threat of sniper fire kept people
locked in their homes or in refugee centers.
</P>
<P>
   The French medical aid agency Doctors Without Borders, which has
been a mainstay of relief operations in Ambon, said seven
truckloads of urgent supplies were stranded at the port because it
was too dangerous to transport them. An official with the group,
Philip Havet, said supplies of food, medicine and drinking water
were running out for refugees and hospital patients.
</P>
<P>
   The situation appears especially desperate because elements of
the military, whose task is to restore order, appear to have taken
sides according to their religious affiliations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The state-run press agency Antara reported Thursday that
military armored cars shot volleys of gunfire at the majority
Christian suburb of Batugantung, forcing people to flee their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maranata Church in a Christian neighborhood, a priest
named Maksianaya said, ``I myself am afraid to go out because there
are still snipers everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the divided city, Malik Selang, an official
at a Muslim emergency center, said the fear of snipers had forced
residents to postpone the removal and burial of a man who had been
killed in an earlier round of shooting.

SENATE VOTES TO CLOSE CAMPAIGN FINANCING LOOPHOLE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a bipartisan bill Thursday that
would require a growing number of secretive, tax-exempt groups that
raise and spend money on political activities to reveal their
donors and spending.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 92-6, with the only votes against the measure cast
by Republicans. The House endorsed the same bill on Wednesday,
385-39. President Clinton said he would sign the measure as soon as
Congress sent it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hailed the outcome as a major victory over Senate and
House Republican leaders who had tried to block the measure, but
they acknowledged that the new law might have only limited impact
on the remaining four months of this campaign cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pretending we don't have other loopholes to close, but
those groups that have found this an easy, painless way to go on
the attack are now going to have to scramble to figure out
different ways,'' said Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., one of the
bill's leading sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shadowy groups formed under Section 527 of the
Internal Revenue Code will probably reorganize to avoid the new
disclosure requirements, tax lawyers said. And many donors may rush
big contributions to the groups, hoping to slip them in under the
wire before the new law takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the phones are ringing over on K Street to get their
money in before the 527's are eliminated,'' said Rep. Michael
Castle, R-Del., who supports the bill, referring to Washington's
center of high-powered lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who heads the Senate
Republican re-election campaign and voted no Thursday, played down
the measure's significance, calling it a ``relatively benign
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell urged fellow Republicans to vote yes, even though he
said the bill was a constitutional infringement on free speech,
``to insulate them against absurd charges that they are in favor of
secret campaign contributions or Chinese money or Mafia money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who championed the Senate bill and
forced Thursday's vote by threatening to single-handedly bottle up
the chamber, said that whatever fallback positions the Section 527
groups take would be less beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will not solve what is wrong with our campaign
finance system,'' McCain said. ``But it will give the public
information regarding one especially pernicious weapon used in
modern campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   A spectrum of political players, including conservative groups
aligned with Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip;
liberal interest groups; and wealthy individuals, have created
Section 527 committees.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations use donations for polling, television and
radio advertising, phone banks and direct-mail appeals, but are not
subject to federal filing or reporting rules so long as they do not
advocate a candidate.

  Health-care professionals training people to save cardiac patients 
(For use after July 3 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ANGELA LEMIRE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can perform basic CPR and push a button when told, you're
qualified to save the life of a co-worker, family member, customer
or even a golfing buddy in cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Once a method reserved for medical professionals, the use of
automatic external defibrillators by laypeople in private and
public workplaces is catching on. This development, touted by
experts as the most important adjunct to cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) within the past few decades, means it is more
likely the life-saving electric shocks can be administered in the
critical first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than laptop computers, programmable in most languages
and simple to use, the AED delivers a shock to the chest powerful
enough to temporarily stop some abnormal heart rhythms that cause
cardiac arrest, giving the heart a chance to return to a beat that
can pump blood again until trained medics arrive.
</P>
<P>
   El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana and Parsons Corporation in
Pasadena are two private business within Los Angeles County that
have formed their own AED response teams recently, according to the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at El Caballero have yet to be called to an actual
cardiac arrest emergency, but the AEDs bring general manager Tom
Bernsen some peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that you hope you never have to
use,'' said Bernsen during a recent training demonstration. ``The
reason we have these defibs here is to stay ahead of the action,
not behind it. We would encourage all businesses to have AEDs. You
just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout California, employees at stadiums, malls, airports,
beaches, restaurants and everyday workplaces also are getting
trained to use AEDs, due largely to legislation passed in January
that protects trained laypeople _ non-medical professionals _ from
getting sued after using AEDs to revive cardiac arrest victims.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Los Angeles plans to pilot AED response teams at
some police stations, Los Angeles Zoo, City Hall and at least one
municipal golf course. Six Flags Magic Mountain, Disneyland, Disney
Studios, San Diego Zoo and Universal Stulf:lreaV/HZX;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Brighter weather will begin across the Northeast on Friday.
While high pressure remains over the Ohio Valley, a drier air flow
will become established over southern New England and the
Mid-Atlantic states. Residual clouds and light showers will persist
across northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between an expanding area of pleasant early summer
weather and sultry conditions will stretch from the Southeast coast
to Texas. Cloudy skies will attend this front and thundershowers
will occur, mainly in the humid air mass.
</P>
<P>
   Hot air building over the Rockies will spread into the western
Plains. Along the advancing edge of warmer air, morning
thunderstorms will occur in parts of the Mississippi Valley. The
Northwest will turn cooler with higher humidity and clouds.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: RISK OF FIRE
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters battling the blaze near the nuclear waste
reservation in Hanford, Wash., will receive help from a change in
the weather Friday. The 100-degree temperatures that have recently
fanned the flames will drop into the '80s in much of interior
Washington as cooler air arrives from the Pacific. With the jet
stream's retreat into Canada, the Northwest often turns quite dry
in the summer, making the area a favored location for wildfires.
This is especially true east of the Cascades, where monthly summer
rainfall is often much less than summer rainfall in the East.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It was a made-for-television story: a cute little boy
survives a nightmare-at-sea, only to come ashore into a maelstrom
of battling sound bites, dueling legal teams, shouting protestors,
an aging but forceful dictator, defiant mayors, crying
grandmothers, a warm-hearted nun and a shocking pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez's story grabbed the imaginations of millions
around the world. Propelled by an avalanche of televised images, it
grew from the story of an improbable, 6-year-old shipwreck survivor
into a fiery international debate that summed up 40 years of bitter
Cuban exile politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally went home to Cuba on Wednesday, the television
networks broke into regular programming and broadcast live pictures
of the motorcade and the jet's taxi and take-off, as if Elian were
a major world figure.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, he was.
</P>
<P>
   Observers disagree over the long-term legacy of Elian's case.
But most agree that the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a story dominated by visuals,'' said Dario Moreno, a
Cuban-American professor of political science at Miami's Florida
International University. ``In a way, there are a lot of
similarities to the O.J. Simpson case. It was a tremendously
dramatic story that captured the interest of a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe more than the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the furious reaction to his story, the impish little
boy is being credited _ partly _ with helping open a crack in the
four-decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba. Congressional leaders
reached a deal to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba just
a day before Elian went home, although the measure has yet to win
final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Elian made the American public more aware than
ever of their country's tortured relationship with Fidel Castro's
communist Cuba. Before Elian, mainstream America knew little about
Cuba. But with the case grabbing headlines and heartstrings, many
Americans were shocked that a father's blood ties to his son might
be sacrificed for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their questions raised the most serious challenge ever to the
power of a small but determined band of Cuban-American lobbyists
who for decades have held great influence over U.S. policy toward
the Caribbean island sitting just 90 miles off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showing that two-thirds of Americans wanted Elian to go
home to Cuba also served as a wake-up call for many of South
Florida's 800,000 Cuban-Americans. After 40 years of exile, they
were accustomed to having their way on the Cuba issue in the
national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the American public was rejecting the heart of their
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't understand us,'' added Josefina Inlimo(CQ),
50, a Cuban-American housewife who fought back tears outside the
home Elian shared with his Miami relatives on the day the boy
returned to Cuba. ``Before Elian, I was proud to be an American.
Now I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's legacy is one of confusion, heartbreak and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the true believers, the reaction is retrenchment,'' said
Damian Fernandez, another Cuban-American academic and author of the
book, Cuba and the Politics of Passion. ``Others feel frustration.
A third group feels apathy and withdrawal, that they don't want to
play the game of politics anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fernandez and Moreno feel the Cuban-American leadership
stumbled badly in their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their error was to say that it was an issue of communism
versus democracy, while the rest of the world saw it as a
father-son issue,'' Fernandez said. ``Now, they've not only lost
Elian, but they've also lost the public relations battle. Their
image is tarnished in the eyes of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Vazquez, a spokesman for the Cuban-American National
Foundation, the most powerful exile lobbying group, dismissed the
criticism, saying the case was a tragedy that will only re-double
the determination of Castro's foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation's obituary has been written so many times and
it's the furthest thing from the truth,'' he said. ``The Elian saga
is a tremendous tragedy, but the mission of the foundation remains
the same: to bring freedom and democracy to the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno agrees that the community suffered losses, but questions
the long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the attention the case got, the political impact was
really minor,'' he said. ``The pressure to loosen the embargo had
been getting stronger every year. And nothing earth-shaking has
happened. We still really haven't seen how it will play out
politically.''
</P>
<P>
   One interesting impact of the case has been its effect on young
Cuban-Americans. Many observers had believed the younger generation
was more moderate than their parents were, and would inevitably
soften the hard line against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian shattered that notion,'' Fernandez said. ``Polls
consistently showed that 90 percent of Cuban-Americans wanted Elian
to stay here, regardless of age. I think Elian embodied something
about the Cuban experience that became a cause for them to define
what it means to be Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Elian case will have a lasting impact on U.S.-Cuba
relations in the long-term remains to be seen. But some longtime
Cuba watchers say the case has already triggered important changes.
</P>
<P>
   John Kavulich(CQ) of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council
believes the Cuban and American governments took an important step
in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, whenever there has been a problem with one facet
of the relationship, all the other facets shut down until the
problem was resolved,'' he said. ``In this case we saw a real
effort by both governments to isolate the Elian problem while they
continued to make progress on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich also credits the boy's saga with educating the American
public about Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became a necessity for the media to present the context in
which the Elian issue was being debated,'' he said. ``The stories
were substantive and went into areas of Cuban life that were not
discussed before. They also provided a picture that many people
were uncomfortable with, of shouting and threats and the separation
of a parent and child.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, those images will stick with many Americans for years
to come: Cuban-American politicians angrily defying the federal
government; protestors burning American flags in the streets of
Miami and the controversial video made by Elian's Miami relatives
showing the boy lecturing his papa.
</P>
<P>
   Also disturbing was the infamous news photo of a gun-wielding
federal agent reaching out for a terrified Elian.
</P>
<P>
   But the unkindest blow for many Cuban-Americans is in the fact
that Fidel Castro comes out once again looking like the victor,
having somehow turned the tables on the exiles and won the public
relations battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro is clearly the big winner, while in many ways, Elian
has left this community shipwrecked,'' Fernandez said. ``It's left
us without a sense of direction. Unfortunately, I don't see any
institutional effort at change. The community is in shock. I'm not
sure what lessons have been learned, and by whom.''

having their way on the Cuba issue in the national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the American public was rejecting the heart of their
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't understand us,'' added Josefina Inlimo(CQ),
50, a Cuban-American housewife who fought back tears outside the
home Elian shared with his Miami relatives on the day the boy
returned to Cuba. ``Before Elian, I was proud to be an American.
Now I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's legacy is one of confusion, heartbreak and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the true believers, the reaction is retrenchment,'' said
Damian Fernandez, another Cuban-American academic anbig winner,
while in many ways, Elian has left this community shipwrecked,''
Fernandez said. ``It's left us without a sense of direction.
Unfortunately, I don't see any institutional effort at change. The
community is in shock. I'm not sure what lessons have been learned,
and by whom.''

UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA STUDY LINKS OBESITY TO BRAIN

<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Can't seem to lose those extra pounds? The
problem may be all in your head, according to one University of
Florida researcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``In normal subjects, the brain reacts to food intake in about
10 minutes,'' said Yijun Liu, a psychiatrist and associate
professor at the University of Florida's College of Medicine. ``In
obese people, the same reaction takes about 14 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu and three researchers from the University of Texas have been
using magnetic resonance imaging to study the human brain and its
reaction to food consumption. They found that the brains of obese
people work differently than the brains of thin people. Part of
their work appeared Thursday in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   In the study featured in Nature, 18 volunteers fasted for 12
hours and were then subjected to a 48-minute brain scan. Ten
minutes into the scan, each subject was fed a sugar-and-water
solution.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that brain activity peaked around 10
minutes after each subject swallowed the solution. The peaks
corresponded with increased levels of glucose in each subject's
blood. The researchers believe that the peaks constitute the
``satiety signal'' that tells people when they've had enough to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   But in an earlier study, Liu and his colleagues found that the
brains of obese people take an average of 14 minutes to respond to
food intake. Four extra minutes might not seem like much, Liu said,
but the delay shows that in the brains of obese people, the
reaction to food intake is significantly diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see that in obese subjects, there is some sort of
abnormal function,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, according to Liu, lies in the hypothalamus, the
part of the brain that regulates body heat and other bodily
functions. When the subjects' brains responded to the intake of
food, Liu said, most of the changes occurred in the hypothalamus _
leading the researchers to believe that the hypothalamus regulates
the levels of glucose in the blood. In obese subjects, the
hypothalamus didn't respond as promptly or as strongly as in
thinner people.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean you can blame those few extra pounds on a
faulty hypothalamus. According to Liu, the delayed reaction may be
a result of obesity, rather than its cause.
</P>
<P>
   Liu intends to use MRI technology in the future to study the
brains of people who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder. He
said he came up with the idea of studying the brain's reaction to
food shortly after he came to the United States from Nanjing
University in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is a very wealthy country, and there is a very large
percentage of heavy people here,'' he said. ``This is a very hot
area for research.''

 &HT;    TEACHERS SEEK MORE MINORITY COLLEAGUES
 &HT;    620&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The gap between the number of minority teachers and
the number of minority students in the public schools is still
growing, officials of the National Education Association reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They called for more use of new programs that have had some
success in attracting and keeping minorities as part of the current
drive to hire 2 million new teachers in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely that in the near future, the proportion of
minority teachers will come anywhere near the growing number of
minority students,'' said Segun Eubanks, the NEA's senior
professional associate for teaching and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, due to the success of some of the recent
efforts at recruiting and retention, the decline in minority
teachers seems to have been stemmed, and has stabilized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government records analyzed by the NEA, which includes more than
half of the nation's public school teachers, show that all but 13.5
percent of public school teachers in 1991 and all but 9.3 percent
in 1996 were white. In 1996, about 4 percent of teachers of all
races were of Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
   Widely quoted projections indicate that before the end of this
decade, 40 percent of all students, but only 5 percent of the
teachers, will be minorities. ``The student projections are holding
up,'' said Eubanks, an African American.
</P>
<P>
   But limited studies indicate that today minorities among
teachers are slightly higher than projected, about 13 percent. He
said he expects that figure to stay steady or rise by a few
percentage points in the decade ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Though its membership reflects the heavily white nature of the
teaching work force, the NEA has long supported outreach to
minorities. Traditionally, 20 percent of the officers and board of
the association are non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of NEA members from across the country attended two
days of workshops here Wednesday and Thursday to discuss various
methods of minority outreach prior to the NEA's annual convention,
known as the ``representative assembly,'' which opens Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The association deplores the current trend'' toward fewer
minority teachers, said NEA President Bob Chase. ``Our policies,
programs and varied activities encourage the development of a
teaching force that reflects the nation's population and changing
demographics. ``
</P>
<P>
   Seven out of 10 school superintendents, and nearly eight out of
10 superintendents in large urban districts, said in surveys this
year that they want to hire more teachers from diverse racial and
ethnic backgrounds because their student bodies are becoming more
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   But too few follow through effectively, according to Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A new edition issued this year of a national NEA directory lists
more than 100 examples of programs sponsored by nonprofit,
educational, business, community or other groups who claimed
success in increasing the number of minority teachers in their city
or region.
</P>
<P>
   Most followed one or more of these strategies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Using extra-curricular efforts like Future Educators of
America or curricular innovations like teaching career academies to
interest middle school and high school students in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stepping up financial aid for potential teachers, especially
those who already work as teaching aides or want to leave the
military and other professions, and conducting more recruiting
efforts in minority communities and schools of education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Offering extra help, such as courses in test-taking skills or
tutoring, to minorities who say they intend to teach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mentoring new teachers so they won't join the one-fifth of
teachers of all races who leave the profession within their first
two years of teach.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But many teachers at the workshops suggested more down-to-earth
methods, such as increasing the salary and prestige of teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the young people get an education, and have a skill that
is marketable, they are going to go where the money is,'' said
Malcolm Bailey, a Sioux who taught art for 29 years in Billings,
Mont., and chairs the NEA's minority affairs committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hope that love of their reservation or neighborhood or
wherever brings them back after they've made big bucks, because we
need role models, particularly for minority males,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those programs all sound fine and good, but if our college
graduates have an opportunity to obtain jobs in other fields that
are much more lucrative, how will we convince them to go into
teaching?'' asked a Filipina, Carmen Periquet of Waukesha, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is just out of college, and he laughs at me, because he
makes $57,000, more than I do after nearly three decades of
teaching,'' said Rose Marie Gonzalez, a bilingual teacher in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make more from my pension as a county employee than my wife
does as a full-time teacher,'' said her husband Mauro. He recently
donated his computer to her first-grade classroom, because the
district didn't replace one stolen in a break-in.

 &HT;    INS STRUGGLES TO DEAL WITH A FLOOD OF IMMIGRANTS
 &HT;    910&AMP;add. With IMMIGRANTS-CITIZENS and IMMIGRANTS-DATA. For
release Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mexican-born Vianey Cano is the kind of
hard-working scholastic star who would make any parent proud. From
humble roots, she immigrated to Los Angeles nine years ago,
perfected English, earned a merit scholarship to college and
graduated last year from Occidental College with honors.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a migrant farm worker, Cano, 25, now has her
sights set on a master's degree, then a doctorate, with the aim of
becoming a college professor.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one hitch in this American success story. Despite
her efforts, Cano is not an American and not likely to become one
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Her life is on hold, just like more than 2 million applicants
for citizenship and legal residency caught in a bureaucratic
backlog of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
   Cano is on a two-year waiting list for an interview for her
application to become a permanent legal resident. Once obtained, by
law it is another five-year wait to apply for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she is unable to continue her studies because student
aid is unavailable until she acquires her legal status. For Cano,
tuition in California would be assessed at an international student
rate, roughly $10,000 a year more than she would pay as a state
resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is a citizen, but I must wait 25 months before I can
be interviewed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of immigrants, America represents the promised
land. That is, if they can survive what one member of Congress has
dubbed ``the agency from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, the INS has been working to reduce a mountainous
backlog of applications from immigrants hoping to become
naturalized as American citizens, amid the biggest wave of
immigration to the United States since the unprecedented surge from
Europe between 1900 and 1920.
</P>
<P>
   On average, waiting times for naturalization cases have been
reduced from 28 months to 12 months, according to the INS. The
agency's goal is to pare the wait to six months by October. The INS
claims to have cut its record backlog of nearly 2 million
naturalization cases in 1998 down to about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't solved its problems. Critics charge that by
diverting resources to draw down the naturalization case load, the
waiting times are increased for immigrants seeking legal permanent
residency, working papers and other status changes. Another backlog
is building, they warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are deep problems with the system and it needs to be
reorganized,'' said Judith Golub of the American Immigration
Lawyers Association. ``After all, what's more important to this
country than helping people become citizens, reuniting families and
helping American businesses who need workers get workers?''
</P>
<P>
   America's foreign-born population has climbed to a record 25.8
million, or about 9.7 percent of the country's total population,
with 9 million naturalized citizens and 16 million noncitizens.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the agency's total budget for enforcement and
immigrant services has tripled, with planned spending for 2001 to
total $4.8 billion. The INS has more than 29,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The INS readily acknowledges its shortcomings and asserts it has
made progress toward reducing the backlog.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said the agency, which still
relies on paper files in this era of computerization, hopes
Congress will finance a three-year plan to automate the agency.
``The institutional machinery simply could not handle the pressure
of the workload,'' she said at a briefing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has opened a toll-free national customer service
center and built a national repository for files in Missouri to
increase its efficiency in handling cases. It is also stressing to
its workers the need to make the agency more responsive. ``That
cultural transformation is arguably the hardest to bring about,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet INS officials also say they are coping with factors beyond
their control, including economic forces that entice immigrants to
America and policy changes enacted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not an easy task. Managers in the field have had the
tough job of balancing all their resources,'' said INS spokeswoman
Elaine Komis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for many immigrants the worst part of the process is
simply not knowing where their applications stand.
</P>
<P>
   It a fit of outrage, New York immigration lawyer Ted Ruthizer
sent the INS a terse letter in April 1998 after the agency informed
him that it was ready to interview his client. The client could not
attend the naturalization interview, Ruthizer wrote back in a
poignant, single-sentence letter, ``as he died waiting for his
(interview) date to be scheduled.''
</P>
<P>
   Such embarrassing examples prompted the INS to put in place a
two-year plan to eradicate the backlog, with the help of
supplemental spending from Congress and a huge hike in the cost of
applying for citizenship, from $95 to $225.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the agency say the INS has gained ground in
recent months simply because the large fee increase has resulted in
fewer applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason things have eased is that there are fewer
applications, particularly among low-income families,'' said Harry
Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a
California-based research group on Hispanic affairs. ``We're
pricing citizenship out of the reach of many immigrants, and that a
disturbing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the agency's management snafus continue.
</P>
<P>
   A government audit recently found that the INS lost files on
about 44,000 applicants in the Los Angeles area and 4,000 in the
Chicago area as it was computerizing its files in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many families are still waiting to hear if they will be
granted citizenship?'' asked Rep. Judy Biggert, R-Ill., who
prompted the Government Accounting Office to investigate the
missing cases. ``We cannot expect people to put their lives on hold
because the INS cannot keep track of their paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are sharp political differences on Capitol Hill over
how and whether to allow more immigrants into America, there is a
bipartisan bad opinion of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing in February, Rep. Lynn Woolsey,
D-Calif., called the INS ``the agency from hell'' in reference to
the case backlog.
</P>
<P>
   In withering comments in April, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas,
chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, suggested that
taxpayers should hire remedial math tutors for the INS after the
agency mistakenly allowed more high-tech workers into the United
States. ``It would cost less than hiring a big-name accounting firm
every time the agency must count past 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee, joined the bandwagon last week, joining
others in proposing to split the INS into two agencies, one to
enforce immigration laws and the other to provide services to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The INS is everyone's favorite punching bag. It has a
difficult job, but it continues to disappoint. It is everybody's
concern,'' said Larry Gonzalez, Washington director of the National
Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. ``When
people out there in the community hear there are attempts on
Capitol Hill to restructure the INS, they say: 'Here's the match.
Where can I light the bomb?' ``
</P>
<P>
   For Cano, the California scholar awaiting her INS interview, it
is a nervous time. Her now-retired father, who came to America in
1978 to pick crops in Georgia, Texas, Florida and California before
landing a factory job in Los Angeles, became a naturalized citizen
last year. But his health is failing and he needs a liver
transplant. Should he die before her scheduled interview, it could
ruin her chances to become a citizen. By law, he must be physically
present at the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the INS's job is not likely to get easier anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   America's high-tech industry continues to clamor for approval to
bring in thousands more tech workers from abroad on temporary visas
to fill skilled jobs that Americans cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Census Bureau predicts a growing need for immigrants to
fill the U.S. work force as baby boomers reach retirement age. The
most pressing need will occur between 2020 and 2030, according to a
recent study, which could return immigration levels to the highs of
the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The projections are not lost on the INS, which offers no
guarantees of future performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've hit the peak and we're coming down in the
number of applications,'' said Komis, the INS spokeswoman. ``It is
such an iffy thing, because our workload depends on so many policy
issues and so much of what's going on in our country. We're making
progress now, but it is difficult to predict. Who knows when the
next avalanche might come?''

 &HT;    FEWER IMMIGRANTS ARE BECOMING CITIZENS
 &HT;    With IMMIGRANTS and IMMIGRANTS-DATA. For release Sunday, July 2.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America has more immigrants, but fewer are becoming
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Only about one-third of the nation's immigrants have obtained
citizenship, the smallest proportion in the past century. The
phenomenon was detailed in a U.S. Census Bureau report released
late last year that sparked a debate over the reasons for the
decline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 35 percent of foreign-born people in the United
States were naturalized citizens, compared to 64 percent in 1970.
During the major wave of immigration in the early 20th century,
about half of all immigrants became citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Immigration and Naturalization Service say the
decline was caused by policy changes that made it more difficult
and more expensive to become a citizen. The huge backlog of
naturalization cases also has discouraged many immigrants from
applying, said Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas(cq) Riviera
Policy Institute, a research group on Hispanic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Other social analysts question whether the numbers indicate an
growing unwillingness among immigrants to assimilate to life in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The large proportion of immigrants from Mexico _ 28 percent of
the foreign-born population in the United States _ could have much
to do with the decline. In 1990, about 22 percent of the
Mexican-born population had become naturalized citizens. By 1997,
the number had fallen to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants from nearby Mexico may be less willing to seek
U.S. citizenship than those from Europe and Asia. Immigrants from
Asia increased their citizenship rate from 40 to 44 percent between
1990 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   People with higher levels of education also are more likely to
seek citizenship than those who have not completed high school, the
report said.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S LEGACY: A SPOTLIGHT ON GOOD, BAD, UGLY OF CUBA POLITICS
 &HT;    With US-CUBA-$ADV02.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., July 2 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It was a made-for-television story: a cute little boy
survives a nightmare-at-sea, only to come ashore into a maelstrom
of battling sound bites, dueling legal teams, shouting protestors,
an aging but forceful dictator, defiant mayors, crying
grandmothers, a warm-hearted nun and a shocking pre-dawn raid.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez's story grabbed the imaginations of millions
around the world. Propelled by an avalanche of televised images, it
grew from the story of an improbable, 6-year-old shipwreck survivor
into a fiery international debate that summed up 40 years of bitter
Cuban exile politics.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally went home to Cuba on Wednesday, the television
networks broke into regular programming and broadcast live pictures
of the motorcade and the jet's taxi and take-off, as if Elian were
a major world figure.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, he was.
</P>
<P>
   Observers disagree over the long-term legacy of Elian's case.
But most agree that the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a story dominated by visuals,'' said Dario Moreno, a
Cuban-American professor of political science at Miami's Florida
International University. ``In a way, there are a lot of
similarities to the O.J. Simpson case. It was a tremendously
dramatic story that captured the interest of a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe more than the images will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the furious reaction to his story, the impish little
boy is being credited _ partly _ with helping open a crack in the
four-decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba. Congressional leaders
reached a deal to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba just
a day before Elian went home, although the measure has yet to win
final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Elian made the American public more aware than
ever of their country's tortured relationship with Fidel Castro's
communist Cuba. Before Elian, mainstream America knew little about
Cuba. But with the case grabbing headlines and heartstrings, many
Americans were shocked that a father's blood ties to his son might
be sacrificed for politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their questions raised the most serious challenge ever to the
power of a small but determined band of Cuban-American lobbyists
who for decades have held great influence over U.S. policy toward
the Caribbean island sitting just 90 miles off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showing that two-thirds of Americans wanted Elian to go
home to Cuba also served as a wake-up call for many of South
Florida's 800,000 Cuban-Americans. After 40 years of exile, they
were accustomed to having their way on the Cuba issue in the
national political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the American public was rejecting the heart of their
argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans don't understand us,'' added Josefina Inlimo(CQ),
50, a Cuban-American housewife who fought back tears outside the
home Elian shared with his Miami relatives on the day the boy
returned to Cuba. ``Before Elian, I was proud to be an American.
Now I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Elian's legacy is one of confusion, heartbreak and
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the true believers, the reaction is retrenchment,'' said
Damian Fernandez, another Cuban-American academic and author of the
book, Cuba and the Politics of Passion. ``Others feel frustration.
A third group feels apathy and withdrawal, that they don't want to
play the game of politics anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Fernandez and Moreno feel the Cuban-American leadership
stumbled badly in their handling of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their error was to say that it was an issue of communism
versus democracy, while the rest of the world saw it as a
father-son issue,'' Fernandez said. ``Now, they've not only lost
Elian, but they've also lost the public relations battle. Their
image is tarnished in the eyes of the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Vazquez, a spokesman for the Cuban-American National
Foundation, the most powerful exile lobbying group, dismissed the
criticism, saying the case was a tragedy that will only re-double
the determination of Castro's foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation's obituary has been written so many times and
it's the furthest thing from the truth,'' he said. ``The Elian saga
is a tremendous tragedy, but the mission of the foundation remains
the same: to bring freedom and democracy to the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno agrees that the community suffered losses, but questions
the long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   age. I think Elian embodied something about the Cuban experience
that became a cause for them to define what it means to be Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Elian case will have a lasting impact on U.S.-Cuba
relations in the long-term remains to be seen. But some longtime
Cuba watchers say the case has already triggered important changes.
</P>
<P>
   John Kavulich(CQ) of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council
believes the Cuban and American governments took an important step
in their handling of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, whenever there has been a problem with one facet
of the relationship, all the other facets shut down until the
problem was resolved,'' he said. ``In this case we saw a real
effort by both governments to isolate the Elian problem while they
continued to make progress on other

&HT;     WAXMAN AND COBURN DEFEND PLAN TO CUT S.F. AIDS FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reps. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., and Tom Coburn,
R-Okla., on Thursday defended their plan to cut San Francisco's
share of federal AIDS funding by 25 percent over five years, saying
the city has been ``overcompensated.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman said bipartisan legislation they introduced Thursday
``slowly gets rid of marked discrepancies'' in AIDS funding to 51
cities ravaged by the epidemic, Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some areas, San Francisco particularly, that will
not be able to maintain the same level of funding that they have
today,'' Waxman told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS program is named after Ryan White, a teenager from
Kokomo, Ind., and a hemophiliac who died of AIDS in 1990 after
contracting the disease through a blood transfusion. The program
pays for care and drugs for people with HIV and AIDS who don't have
private insurance but aren't poor or sick enough to receive
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said per capita Ryan White funding is nearly double in
San Francisco compared to other cities. He cited statistics from
the General Accounting Office, the research arm of Congress,
showing Ryan White funding for each AIDS case in San Francisco last
year was $5,958, compared to $2,509 in San Antonio, $2,892 in
Houston, $3,068 in Los Angeles and $3,090 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else feels that (San Francisco) is
overcompensated,'' Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who represents a Northern California
district, vowed to fight the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should know better than to be slicing up a community where
there is great need,'' Eshoo said.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman, the original sponsor of the Ryan White Care Act in 1991,
said lawmakers in both the House and Senate recognize
``inequities'' in the funding formula and want to reduce San
Francisco's share.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Waxman-Coburn plan, San Francisco's share of the AIDS
money couldn't drop below 75 percent of its current level, with
annual cuts of 2 percent, 2.3 percent, 4.6 percent, 6.9 percent and
9.2 percent. The House Commerce Committee, which oversees the Ryan
White care program, has scheduled a July 11th hearing on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate-passed version of the Ryan White program is less tough
on San Francisco and would freeze San Francisco's share of the
money at no less than 98 percent of the current $35.3 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House passes its version of the Ryan White program, the
House and Senate bills will go to a joint House-Senate conference
committee where negotiators will come up with a compromise. The
House bill would decrease San Francisco's current share of Ryan
White money by $5 million over five years, compared to $1.7 million
for the Senate version, according to staffers for Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   When the federal program began in 1991, San Francisco's share of
the money was relatively large because the funding formula was
based on the density of AIDS cases in a city as well as its
cumulative number of AIDS cases, both living and dead. When
Congress in 1996 changed the formula to be based on the estimated
number of people living with AIDS in a city, San Francisco's share
would have been diminished because many people with AIDS had
already died. But Congress decided to limit any cuts to San
Francisco to avoid harming existing AIDS programs there.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers set about to update the five-year Ryan White
legislation this year, health officials in Los Angeles and other
cities complained that San Francisco was getting an unfair share.
The Waxman-Coburn bill would remove that special provision.
</P>
<P>
   Waxman and Coburn also said their bill focuses on reaching HIV
positive people who are not now receiving help under the Ryan White
program. By 2007, Ryan White money would be distributed to cities
based on the number of people with HIV, instead of the number of
people with AIDS, as is now the case.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said the HIV is now spreading fastest among minority
women and children, adding that formula changes are needed ``to
make sure the dollars go where the disease is.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Waxman: ``What was once seen as a disease of gay white men
or of injection drug users is more than ever a terrible threat to
our communities of color, to women and adolescents, in short to all
of us.''

&HT;     GORE SAYS GAS PRICES PROVE NEED FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore sought Thursday to convert
public ire about high gasoline prices into support for an ambitious
10-year $25 billion package of federal tax breaks to encourage
cities to expand their public transit systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, portrayed
his proposal as an effort to offer Americans new choices for
commuting, rather than a federally mandated bid to oust commuters
from their cars and into crowded rail cars or urban buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be realistic: People want to drive their own cars and
they should have the right always to drive their own cars,'' Gore
told several hundred people gathered on a terrace of Chicago's Navy
Pier. ``Don't tell me that there's a great groundswell to get rid
of cars and push people into mass transit whether they want it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``You deserve the independence to get in your car
and drive anywhere you want to go on your own schedule without
having to empty your wallet at every filling station. You should
also have the choice _ if you want it _ to park your car at the
light rail and be moved swiftly into the newly thriving downtown
without having to worry about gridlock or a parking lot or rush
hour traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore dubbed it an ``old, timid way of thinking'' for Americans
to believe that enhancing environmental protection means ``that to
help the earth you have to give up your own car for a crowded
subway car or turn down your air conditioning or swelter indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices in the Midwest are the highest in the lower 48
states, nation,
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to focus Midwest consumers' ire over skyrocketing
gasoline prices at large oil companies rather that Clinton-Gore
administration policies. He called for a Federal Trade Commission
inquiry into gasoline pricing to conduct public hearings to enable
Americans to hear first hand the explanations of oil executives for
the $2 a gallon cost of the reformulated low-pollution gasoline
that was required in 15 Midwestern urban areas including Chicago
beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
   FTC spokesman Mitchell Katz said the FTC was conducting a
private investigation and would reports its results to Congress by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here?'' Gore wondered aloud after citing
soaring profits for oil companies at the outset of this year
despite higher costs for crude oil. The vice president called
gasoline prices ``no less than outrageous,'' adding that the
federal government's quasi-independent FTC ought to ``pursue that
investigation vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said oil companies already are reducing the costs of
gasoline in the hard-hit Midwest now that the industry is faced
with the onslaught of the FTC's subpoena powers, its investigative
staff and the agency's ability to shine the public spotlight into
corporate decision-making at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposal would encourage urban centers to convert
bus fleets to more energy efficient, cleaner engines; create new
light rail systems linking cities to suburbs; and encourage
creation of safe residential and retail communities adjacent to
transit stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there nothing as efficient as a steel wheel on a steel
rail,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Once consumers have alternative ways to commute to work, it will
reduce the oil industry's stranglehold on American commuters, Gore
said. With more rail links available, if ``big oil tries to take
advantage of whatever ability they have to manipulate the prices
and a lot of people say, `I'm not driving this week, I'm going to
make another choice,' then you'll see them start feeling the
pressure from consumers in a new way and they won't be as able to
get away with it.''

 Includes black-and-white photos of jazz musician Louis Armstrong. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Some parties take a whole year to do them justice.
 &HT;    Louis ``Satchmo'' Armstrong, jazz trumpeter, singer and the man
Bing Crosby called ``the beginning and the end of music in
America,'' would have been 100 years old in August 2001. Or so it
is believed, at any rate, although this _ like many other aspects
of his life _ is in some dispute.
 &HT;    What is not contested is that Armstrong, who died on July 7,
1971, at his home in Queens, N.Y., was the most popular figure in
the history of jazz. The Los Angeles Times ran a memorial cartoon
depicting him in heaven, facing the angel Gabriel in a trumpet
contest _ and winning.
 &HT;    For such a larger-than-life figure, no ordinary birthday party
would suffice. A full year early, the festivities have already
begun, with the first glass being hoisted in New Orleans, city of
Armstrong's birth, and one with which he had a lifelong love-hate
relationship.
 &HT;    ``He had very ambivalent feelings about New Orleans,'' admits
Sean Cummings, owner of the city's chic International House hotel.
``He came back here only a very few times. But any black man who
grew up in the notorious Storyville district of this city would
have had difficulties with the past. We love him, and this will be
the biggest party we've ever thrown.''
 &HT;    It begins in the hotel's high-ceilinged lobby with a display by
veteran photographer Herman Leonard, who met Armstrong in Paris in
1950 and has recently published his photographs of Armstrong and
other jazz legends in a beautiful black-and-white coffee table
book, ``Jazz Memories,'' published in France.
 &HT;    ``Over 20 years I never saw him with a sober look on his face,''
Leonard recalls. ``He was always affable. He was always so
ebullient, an extraordinary human being.''
 &HT;    Further in the future, in fall 2002 the Louis Armstrong House
and Archives, housed in the Rosenthal Library on the campus of
Queens College in Flushing, N.Y., will open Armstrong's old home at
34-56 107th Street, where he lived with his fourth wife, Lucille,
from l943 until his death.
 &HT;    The house, a National Historic Landmark, has been completely
refurbished.
 &HT;    ``Not an ashtray has been moved,'' says archives director
Michael Cogswell. ``Nobody has lived there since the Armstrongs. It
will be like going to visit Louis and Lucille.''
 &HT;    Internet travelers can get a preview peek by logging onto
www.satchmo.com.
 &HT;    Last year 650 reels of tape-recorded conversations were made
available for the first time, capturing Armstrong and his cronies
in late-night, after-the-show bull sessions at home in Queens.
 &HT;    ``Anyone can listen to them,'' Cogswell says. ``You don't have
to be a professor or writing a book.''
 &HT;    But you do need a tolerance for the scatological. Armstrong had
an earthy sense of humor, and didn't hesitate to express it in
private _ as Cogswell realized when First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton visited the archives in 1998 and asked to hear some of the
recordings.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to play them for her,'' he recalls, ``but we had the
damnedest time finding clean ones.''
 &HT;    Armstrong comes across as a cheerful, down-to-earth man,
regardless of who he was with. On the tapes, he recalls a visit
with Princess Margaret, the Duke of Kent and other members of the
British royal family _ ``the royalty cats,'' he calls them.
 &HT;    ``They come over to Paris to catch us when we was at the Olympic
Theater,'' the musician says on the recording, ``and after the show
they wanted to take me to the big restaurants. I say, `I was just
on my way to scarf, man.'''
 &HT;    Dining with royalty was just another meal for Armstrong, who had
grown up in New Orleans surrounded by run-down tenements, brothels,
honkytonks, dance halls and churches. He was raised in a household
of women headed by his mother, his father having walked out on the
family when Armstrong was a baby, and got into his fair share of
trouble.
 &HT;    Music was his salvation, however. He sang for tips with three
other kids on the street corners of Storyville until a brush with
the law got him shipped off to the Colored Waifs Home. It might
have been a dead end, but there the young boy encountered
instrumental music and got his hands on his first trumpet. The rest
is literally history.
 &HT;    I met Armstrong only once, not long before his death. It was in
l969, on the set of the movie ``Hello Dolly'' at the Twentieth
Century Fox studios in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As a foreign correspondent for the London Daily Express, I had
gone to interview a young British actor named Michael Crawford, who
was over the moon at having landed a key role in a lavish Hollywood
musical. Needless to say, he was still decades away from his
definitive performance as Broadway's ``Phantom of the Opera.''
 &HT;    Gene Kelly, as always preternaturally cheerful no matter how
frantic things got on the set, was directing the biggest scene in
the movie, the one in which Dolly Levi (Barbra Streisand), in a
dazzling outfit, marches into a nightclub as Armstrong leads
everyone in the movie's title song, his signature tune, ``Hello
Dolly.''
 &HT;    Afterward I was chatting with Crawford when, much to our
delight, Armstrong ambled over and introduced himself _ as if he
needed to _ and stopped to talk.
 &HT;    We discussed London, a city he said he had loved since his first
visit, way back in l932. He was given a new trumpet, which he used
onstage at the London Palladium. The critics raved and the
audiences cheered.
 &HT;    Later, however, a columnist for a London newspaper published a
particularly vicious, virulently racist attack on the great
musician, using terms that today would not be tolerated anywhere.
Nevertheless, Armstrong said, he could never wait to return to the
British capital, which he had grown to love almost as much as he
loved Paris.
 &HT;    I gave him my business card, and later he sent me a photo of
himself _ one which was somewhat unusual, to say the least. It
depicted Armstrong, pants over ankles, sitting on a toilet over the
slogan, ``Leave it all behind.''
 &HT;    It was his calling card _ a commercial, I later learned, for a
famous laxative to which he was devoted.
 &HT;    Alas, I lost track of that picture, which singer Tony Bennett
told me Armstrong had also passed out to members of the Royal
Family at a black-tie dinner following a royal command performance
in London.
 &HT;    ``That's Louis,'' someone at the studio told me. ``He's a
no-B.S. guy.''
 &HT;    He would have been equally frank, I was told, in discussing his
sex life or his firm belief in the salutary effects of marijuana.
 &HT;    Now, though he has been dead for almost three decades, and
though countless biographies have exhaustively documented his life,
there are those 650 reels of candid tape recordings to preserve his
conversational style.
 &HT;    In the end, however, the best way to get to know Louis Armstrong
is through his music, hundreds of recordings which constitute a
virtual panoramic history of jazz in the 20th century.
 &HT;    Through them emerges an American legend who will be with us well
into the next millennium.

ALIEN RESURRECTION: MAJANDRA DELFINO CELEBRATES THE RETURN OF
`ROSWELL' 
</HEADLINE>

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Majandra
Delfino with Brendan Fehr in a scene from ``Roswell.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    They said that ``Roswell'' was hanging by a thread, that the
powers that be at the WB network had the show ``on the bubble''
between renewal and cancellation.
 &HT;    Millions of fans worried, but somehow _ call it intuition, gut
instinct or simply wishful thinking _ Majandra Delfino wasn't one
of them. The actress, who stars in the show, says she wasn't all
that surprised when creator/producer/writer Jason Katims called
with the news that the network had renewed ``Roswell'' for a second
season.
 &HT;    ``I hoped. I knew,'' says Delfino, who plays Maria DeLuca on the
low-rated but critically lauded sci-fi series. ``I felt the WB was
saying, `Yeah, it might not' just to get us scared, to motivate us.
 &HT;    ``I just felt that we did so well once they changed our night,''
she adds, speaking of the show's shift from Wednesdays to Mondays.
``I thought, `How could they not pick us up?'
 &HT;    ``I was celebrating my best friend's birthday in Miami, and
Jason Katims called me from Jamaica to tell me the news. I was
like, `Oh, OK, so my suspicions were right.'''
 &HT;    Suspicions are the lifeblood of ``Roswell,'' of course. Who are
the benevolent aliens? Who are the rotten ones? Can our hero aliens
_ Max (Jason Behr), Isabel (Katherine Heigl) and Michael (Brendan
Fehr), who grew up on Earth in human form _ trust their human pals
Maria and Alex (Colin Hanks) to keep their secret?
 &HT;    Oh, and is shifty Sheriff Valenti (William Sadler) really a good
guy now?
 &HT;    As the first season unfolded, Maria evolved from a jittery ditz
into a formidable young woman. She stood up to her mother, devised
impromptu action plans to help her alien friends dodge the FBI and
threw herself hard into a volatile relationship with the often
emotionally remote Michael.
 &HT;    ``I liked that they explored all of that and didn't just make
her the dumb blond,'' Delfino says by cellular telephone,
breathless as she wends her way across Los Angeles to a dentist
appointment. ``They made Maria a free spirit with a brain.''
 &HT;    No dumb bunny herself, Delfino _ who plays piano, writes music
and is something of a mathematics wiz _ spent part of her
``Roswell'' hiatus in Cincinnati, acting in director Steven
Soderbergh's buzzed-about drama, ``Traffic.'' She plays a
drug-abusing high-schooler who's a bad influence on Michael
Douglas' daughter.
 &HT;    In only a couple of weeks, however, Delfino will be back on the
``Roswell'' set. The WB greenlit 13 new episodes, and the network
will decide whether or not to produce another nine soon after the
first few shows air.
 &HT;    Delfino reveals that season two will continue the sci-fi
emphasis that dominated last year's latter episodes. And, despite
unmistakable intimations that Isabel and Michael were meant to be
together, the actress believes fans will see more of Maria and
Michael.
 &HT;    ``Listen, that's all my fan mail is about,'' the actress says of
the fiery Maria-Michael relationship, which contrasts sharply with
the lovey-dovey, Romeo-and-Juliet bond between Liz and Max.
``Everyone was dying because Michael kissed Isabel. They were so
afraid that meant Michael and Isabel had to be together.
 &HT;    ``It was all, `Let's please keep Maria and Michael together,'''
she says, laughing. ``As if I write the stories. So there are some
really diehard fans of Michael and Maria.
 &HT;    ``But I'm sure they won't be separating us,'' she concludes.
``The fans need to relax.''
 &HT;    Delfino, however, can't relax. As she drives past a parking-lot
attendant and hurries into her dentist's office, the 19-year-old
can only marvel at her good fortune.
 &HT;    Beyond ``Roswell'' and ``Traffic,'' she has the independent
feature ``Learning Curve,'' which currently is navigating the
film-festival circuit in search of a distributor. Later this year,
she'll send up Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the horror
spoof ``I Know What You Screamed Last Summer.''
 &HT;    ``My whole acting career _ the whole three years of it _ I've
never been out of work,'' Delfino says, cracking up. ``And the work
I've done I've been so happy with. I thought `Roswell' was such a
great thing _ and then I booked a Steven Soderbergh film on my time
off. I couldn't believe it _ I didn't do some cheesy teen movie,
but a quality, high-budget film where you read the script and go,
`Damn.'
 &HT;    ``It's a little too much,'' she says. ``It's all happening too
quickly. Pretty soon I'm expecting to get married and have kids!''

   Chicken Run
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Miranda
Richardson, Benjamin Whitrow, Tony Haygarth, Phil Daniels
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park
</P>
<P>
   G 86 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Times are desperate for several dozen English hens at the Tweedy
farm. ``We lay day in and day out, and when we don't lay enough,
they kill us,'' one of them explains. Farmer Tweedy swings the
hatchet, but policy is set by his production-obsessed wife, who
runs the barnyard like a concentration camp, with barbed wire along
the fences and the number 17, as in Stalag 17, painted on one of
the barrackslike henhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The sole holiday is a stretch of solitary confinement in a coal
bin. If only the hens could escape. Led by the determined Ginger
(Sawalha), they dig and drill with an eggbeater. That gets them
nowhere. ``We haven't tried not trying to escape; that might
work,'' a hen suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger dreams of an air route, whether by wing, slingshot or
catapult. Then, literally out of the blue, comes Rocky, an actual
flying rooster, or so it would appear. Rocky (Gibson) says he is a
professionial. He is also an American, which draws some skepticism.
``Overpaid, oversexed and over here,'' one hen comments.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ginger hails him as their one last hope and
persuades him to teach the hens to fly. Calisthenics ensue, but
early flight tests prove unpromising. Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy has
hit on a better way to make money: Grind up the birds for chicken
potpies.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Tweedy puts together a ghastly portable potpie maker. The
hens' feed is increased, adding avoirdupois and taxing already
questionable aerodynamics. Would this have stopped the Wright
Brothers?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ A hen's head is removed with a quiet chop, heard but
not seen. The pie-making machine graphically dismembers and
squashes all ingredients, and though no hens are caught in the
thing, the process could be mildly unsettling to very small
children. Otherwise the mishaps are plainly cartoon slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ All the hens volunteer to share their nests with Rocky.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ None.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE _ In a process called Claymation, the figures are
modeled out of latex, not drawn. Generally, this gives them a more
lifelike appearance and movement.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6 _ Park, a British animator, is known for his Wallace
and Gromit films, which are a good deal grittier than most animated
movies. Here, any lasting harm is carefully avoided, but the mood
is still a little darker than Disney.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7 AND UP _ Fine.
</P>
<P>
   Me, Myself and Irene
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey, Renee Zellweger, Anthony Anderson, Mongo Brownlee,
Jerod Mixon, Michael Bowman, Robert Forster
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   R 100 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Behind those reflector sunglasses, Charlie Baileygates (Carrey),
a Rhode Island State Police motorcycle officer, looks like a
speeder's worst nightmare. But on patrol and especially at home,
Charlie is milquetoast. ``I get the feeling the whole town is
laughing at me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The victim of a truly spectacular marital disaster, Charlie is
the father of three black sons who were but babes in the backyard
wading pool when their mother, a genius and Mensa chapter head,
took off with their biological father. Left to raise the children,
Charlie has three big, very bright and very obscene teen-agers on
his hands. ``A 1430 on the SATs? Must have an aneurysm,'' says
Shonte Jr. (Mixon).
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor regularly lets his dog defecate on Charlie's lawn.
While he is on the beat, a little girl screams him into submission.
But then something snaps. Suddenly, Charlie has another
personality, named Hank. As aggressive as Charlie is passive, Hank
picks fights with little children and anybody else. Hank himself,
not his dog, defecates on his neighbor's lawn. And those sons had
better get in line or Dad will have to ``bust a cap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Advanced hallucinatory schizophrenia,'' goes the diagnosis,
enlivened by ``involuntarily narcissistic rage.'' It's all very
confusing to Irene (Zellweger), the attractive golf course
groundskeeper who has befriended Charlie and might take up with him
romantically if the belligerent Hank didn't keep assaulting people.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Some men are shot. So is a cow, which refuses to die
and then is strangled by Charlie, who thinks he's doing the animal
a good turn.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ An oversized sex appliance plays a prominent role, as does
a chicken.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ A deep supply of the strongest obscenities and
expressions relating to the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE _ To attract the target audience (teen and young adult,
mostly male), the Farrelly brothers' movies (``There's Something
About Mary'') make all possible use of sexual crudity and bodily
fluids from wherever they may emanate. Deal with it _ or don't.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 12 _ Some will howl in protest, but no.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 _ Are they ready for the Farrellys?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP _ Don't be silly.

   Titan A.E.
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Matt Damon, Bill Pullman, John Leguizamo,
Nathan Lane, Janeane Garofalo, Drew Barrymore
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman
</P>
<P>
   PG 90 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In the 31st century our trusty little planet has been blown up
by an electrostatic force called the Drej, and the few survivors
are hiding out on drifter colonies sailing around the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Out on Salvage Station Tau 14, the short-order cooks are
roaches, and a rocket jockey named Korso (Pullman) is on the
lookout for a 20-something slacker named Cale (Damon). Back when
Earth was destroyed, Cale's father, a professor, gave the boy a
ring that reveals the whereabouts of the Titan A.E. (``after
Earth''), a giant space station that contains all the basics to
help humans get going again on another planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Titan is a hot item. ``Position to destroy,'' wheezes a
Drej, which talks like a disconnected air hose. Korso wants the
Earth capsule to preserve the species, or so he says. Cale still
resents his father for leaving him at the time of the attack (duty
called), but overcomes some attitude problems to contribute plenty
of ``Star Wars''-style heroics. A new planet is found. They call it
Bob.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE _ Plenty of space pyrotechnics and annihilation,
usually viewed at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   SEX _ Cale takes to a good-looking fellow drifter named Akima
(Barrymore). No time at the moment, but maybe later.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY _ None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6 _ This is no simple, sunny animation for the littlest
ones. The theme and characters are too intense and complicated, and
some situations could be upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-10 _ Probably the best age for this film. The space war
razzle-dazzle will appeal, and youngsters won't be turned off by
simplistic characters who, for all the movie's visual
accomplishments, act and talk as if they belong in Saturday morning
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11 AND UP _ Generally too sophisticated (the viewers, that
is).

the call for an independent counsel to investigate his fundraising.
How are both responding to their tests? What does it tell us about

</P>
<P>
   SECRETMONEY _ Congress sent President Clinton legislation
forcing secretive groups to say who is paying for campaign-style TV
ads, radio spots and phone calls that are being used to influence
elections across the country. The legislation would affect groups
that have seized on a once-obscure section of the tax code to
conduct unlimited political activity without reporting anything
about themselves to the public. It would require these newly
popular, tax-exempt groups to report most donors and spending to
the Internal Revenue Service. (Heath, Austin American-Statesman)

that smaller groupings of students produce better conditions,
whether in a classroom or in a student body. That coin has two

&HT;     INSURANCE REGULATOR FACED TOUGH CHOICE: RESIGN OR BE
IMPEACHED

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Behind the sudden resignation of California
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush is the central dilemma of
every elected official: how to legally separate politics from
public work.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has become a master of the
so-called ``perpetual campaign,'' Quackenbush utterly failed to
keep the two rivers divided.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned Wednesday, a day before he was expected to
appear before the Assembly Insurance Committee, where he would have
faced, under oath, tough questions. The measured, relentless
committee had uncovered startling evidence that Quackenbush had
ordered his staff to fine a title insurance company $4 million
because he needed that precise amount to buy television and radio
time.
</P>
<P>
   This evidence convinced the Assembly it had no choice but to
impeach the two-term Republican commissioner for abuse of power.
Even members of his own party were eager to call for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, where numerous insurance
companies were accused of bilking victims and low-balling claims,
Quackenbush began a ``deliberate effort to use those circumstances
to assemble and implement a perpetual political campaign,'' said
Assemblyman Fred Keeley, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fine the insurance companies tens of millions of
dollars, Quackenbush is accused of coercing them into donating $19
million to nonprofit foundations controlled by his closest aides
and political operatives.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using the money to help Northridge earthquake
victims, Quackenbush's consultants moved in. They produced
``consumer outreach'' television advertising featuring Quackenbush.
Money was donated to other groups that had nothing to do with
Northridge, like $500,000 to the Sacramento Urban League and
$246,000 to a football camp attended by Quackenbush's children.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers ultimately were appalled that Quackenbush had used the
power of his office to compel the companies he regulated to help
him and his political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the commissioner was in a unique position to have
those two worlds collide because he was a regulator, and he could
impose fines,'' said Assembly Republican leader Scott Baugh.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh disagreed, however, with the assessment that Quackenbush
had tried to establish a perpetual campaign by directing money to
the nonprofit foundations. Not all of the money, Baugh said, went
to benefit Quackenbush politically, although his GOP political
consultants enriched themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a system set up by a bunch of folks who stood to
profit,'' Baugh said. ``He was ill-served by his advisers and his
consultants, and they walked him down into a trap that he could not
escape from.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Quackenbush admitted mistakes had been made, he denied
any wrongdoing. By Wednesday, however, he was exhausted and still
under pursuit by two legislative committees, Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, the Fair Political Practices Commission, consumer groups,
the media and the Sacramento County district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's attorney, former federal prosecutor Donald Heller,
heard in a telephone call with Keeley late Tuesday that Quackenbush
was in an untenable position no matter which way he moved: testify
truthfully at a hearing Thursday, and face impeachment. Refuse to
testify, and face impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours later, Quackenbush sent a two-line letter to
Secretary of State Bill Jones, now the last Republican in statewide
office, offering his resignation effective July 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly offered nothing in return, except to cancel its
Thursday hearing where a subpoenaed Quackenbush was scheduled to
testify under oath. In previous appearances before the Legislature,
Quackenbush could go from conciliatory to defiant to defeated in a
single sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has become such an emotional trauma for him that
he could no longer serve effectively as insurance commissioner,''
Heller said. ``I am satisfied he has done nothing illegal or
criminal or improper in any way. He made mistakes, which he readily
admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first resignation of a statewide elected official
since Bill Honig resigned as superintendent of public instruction
in 1993. The situation was somewhat similar: Honig was convicted of
illegally directing public money to benefit a nonprofit education
group his wife founded and ran out of their Pacific Heights home.
</P>
<P>
   Davis must find a replacement to serve out the remainder of
Quackenbush's term, which ends in late 2002. The law requires the
Legislature to confirm the appointment, but both houses leave for a
summer recess July 7.

`BURLESK KING': A SLICE OF LIFE FROM THE PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Burlesk King,'' a film by the Filipino director Mel Chionglo,
which opens Friday in New York after making the rounds on the
international festival circuit, is best described as a curious
blend of Italian neo-realism and soft-core pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's grim, melodramatic slice-of-life view of Manila's
sexual demimonde is intercut with dreamy, slow-motion shots of
undulating, nearly naked male go-go dancers and with squirming,
heavy-breathing sex scenes in which various permutations of gender
and number are represented.
</P>
<P>
   Even more curiously, ``Burlesk King'' isn't especially tawdry or
prurient. Rather, Chionglo's attitude toward his characters, their
bodies and what they do with those bodies for love and money is
tolerant and affectionate.
</P>
<P>
   His hero, Harry (Rodel Velayo), is a pouty young hustler who
leaves his hometown, Olongapo, along with his best friend, James
(Leonardo Litton), for the seedy bustle of Manila, where he finds
work as a so-called macho dancer in a nightclub. He also moonlights
as a gigolo catering to clients of both sexes. He befriends a
lonely romance-novel writer (Raymond Bagatsing) and an upbeat
prostitute named Brenda (Nini Jacinto), who dispenses alms and
big-sisterly advice to the local street urchins.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything goes happily. Harry gets involved in drugs and
offends Brenda's sensitivities by proposing to pimp for her. For
reasons that are not very clear, Harry and James fall afoul of a
local harmonica-playing gangster, which leads to some pseudo-Hong
Kong fight scenes; really this is a movie with something for every
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these sequences are as haphazardly shot and
edited as the sex scenes, and the various plot lines are so
disjointed that the film never generates much emotional momentum.
Its central dramatic crisis involves Harry's memories of his
abusive American father, whose cruelty has soured the young man on
Americans altogether, and may, for all I know, be a metaphor for
the way the United States has treated the Philippines over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are the last thing on this movie's mind. Lithe
young bodies are its main concern. If all of the gyrations were
edited out, ``Burlesk King'' might just eke out an hour of
television melodrama. The story might even be easier to follow. But
of course no one would bother to watch.

   UNDATED _ The storm sequence in ``The Perfect Storm,'' which
lasts a good 40 minutes or so, is the most bludgeoning,
mind-shattering, teeth-rattling, nerve-racking set piece since the
D-Day battle in ``Saving Private Ryan.'' It has glitches, but it

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Fort Worth Museum of Science and

go there to see films about butterflies and dolphins, earthquakes
and volcanoes. You don't go there expecting to celebrate sports
heroes to a jock-jams pop music beat. So the museum's newest IMAX
film, ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' _ added to a film rotation that
includes ``Dolphins'' and ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' _ is an
unusual choice. But the 45-minute portrait of the basketball
superstar is also a good choice. Though not specifically

something extraordinary. All it takes is a movie like ``Extreme''
to wipe those notions away. The IMAX film features world-class
athletes who have conquered extreme sports _ surfing, windsurfing,
skiing, snowboarding, rock climbing and ice climbing. They're

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Both Wimbledon singles champions were in sickly
condition Thursday. Pete Sampras was nursing acute tendinitis of
the left foot. Lindsay Davenport was suffering a severe case of
Elena Likhovtseva.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras used ice, electrical stimulation, and anti-inflammatory
medication to recuperate.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport followed a strict regimen of dynamic serves, radar
volleys, and relentless determination during a crisis to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras received his diagnosis late Wednesday night after the
tendon running from his shin to his foot became inflamed while he
was warming up for a second-round match against Karol Kucera, a
victory that required four sets and one tape job by the trainer.
The top men's seed was in seclusion being treated, but his coach,
Paul Annacone, promised that his star client will take the court
Friday for his third-round match against American compatriot Justin
Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport received her reprieve when she revived herself by
winning the last six games from Likhovtseva for a 3-6, 6-3, 6-3
escape. Davenport will be hoping her game is in more robust shape
Saturday, when she takes the court against Paola Suarez.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is a mellow California girl who inconspicuously has
ascended to the tennis penthouse, but when she is cornered, she'll
respond with a bulldog's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   And that was her situation after she fell into an 0-3 chasm in
the deciding set, having looked alternately gassed and aghast in
splitting the first two. She readily recognized her peril _ and
shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I knew it was going to be tough,'' she said. ``But even
though it's two breaks, she still has to win three more games,
which is kind of a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But not as long as Davenport's route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it wasn't on the tip of my racket, the victory,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of the day, most of Davenport's shots were
beyond the grasp of Likhovtseva. Davenport was a model of menace as
she broke Likhovtseva to 3-1, 3-3, and 5-3. The Russian, ranked 23d
in the world, realized early in Davenport's surge that she wasn't
going to dethrone the queen. She shook her head in resignation when
Davenport, the No. 2 seed, drilled an ace that put her up, 40-0, in
the tying game. Likhovtseva's surrender was complete when she sent
a two-hand backhand of a Davenport service blast into the doubles
alley at 5-3, 40-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six games, I thought I hit the ball great,'' said
Davenport. ``That's what I'm going to try and remember through the
next two days, just remember how I was hitting the ball at the end,
try to start my next match, try to get off to a quicker start, try
and win some games in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this match, she hardly looked ready to put
this title in her trophy case alongside her 1998 US Open, 1999
Wimbledon, and 2000 Australian Open mementos. Likhovtseva reeled
off the first four games, dropped the next three, then easily
wrapped up the opening set. Davenport, hampered by a bad back that
contributed to her first-round exit from the French Open, wore an
expression that was part wince, part scowl even as she was
rebounding in the second set. But it had nothing to with her
health, just that of her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I've been feeling really good again,'' she said.
``I just started off the match so poorly. I found that happening in
Eastbourne (a Wimbledon tuneup) also. For some reason, (I'm)
getting off to really slow starts.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least she averted a fast finish to her title defense.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, meanwhile, was a human ice pack as he tried to prolong
his defense, which, if successful, would provide him with a couple
of bonuses he covets _ a piece of the record for most Wimbledon
men's singles crowns (7), owned by Willie Renshaw; and sole
possession of the standard for most Grand Slam men's singles crowns
(12) he shares with Roy Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, who dubbed himself ``Dr. Paul Annacone'' when he met
the press as Sampras's proxy, said the injury was ``strange, just
kind of came on yesterday out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes well with Sampras's prevailing body colors _ black and
blue. He, too, was victimized by back problems in Paris, where he
lasted one round, and he pulled a back muscle while hitting with
Tim Henman during a pre-Wimbledon warmup at the All England Lawn
Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rough go for a while with Pete with injuries,''
said Annacone, ``so I think, you know, this is just kind of another
injury thrown in front of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropped on him, actually. Sampras had no warning about this
latest malady, which Annacone said developed ``at 5 minutes to 3
yesterday when he walked on the practice court. Can't figure it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Sampras grimaced throughout his gallant performance
against Kucera, Annacone doesn't think it will keep him out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Sampras could have played, Annacone looked incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Wimbledon?'' he said. ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   So of course, he'll be back on public view Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the plan,'' said Annacone. ``As far as I know, he's
going to play, unless he tells me otherwise later.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the elixir for Sampras will be his cushy half of the
draw, which includes only one other seed _ No. 9 Thomas Enqvist,
who hardly is considered a viable threat.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as Sampras and Davenport know, champions have to be
wary of every little thing.

 &HT;    FOR RALPH NADER, PRESIDENTIAL QUEST IS ONE STEP IN A LONG
JOURNEY
 &HT;    820&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader understands that he is not going to be
elected president of the United States this year. But then, winning
the White House is not exactly what his campaign for the presidency
is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory is defined in many ways,'' Nader insisted Thursday at
a breakfast with political reporters from nearly every major
newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
   What he wants, as the nominee of the Green Party, is to do for
the fledgling political organization what Ross Perot did for the
Reform Party: win 5 percent of the vote in November to earn a share
of federal funding this year and in the 2004 election. That would
give the Greens a toehold in the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we want to have a significant third
party that will draw thousands of local, state and national
candidacies in the coming years,'' said Nader, a legendary consumer
advocate and anti-corporate crusader.
</P>
<P>
   If that means siphoning off liberal-leaning voters who might
otherwise vote for Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, well, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Nader wants to see Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
likely GOP nominee, in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with George W. Bush is he's beyond satire,'' Nader
said. ``The challenge for me is: how do you satirize satire? This
guy is straight out of central casting.''
</P>
<P>
   He also described Bush as the ``corporate welfare king of all
presidential candidates,'' a reference to the governor's $14
million profit from the sale of the Texas Rangers after securing a
taxpayer-financed stadium for the professional baseball franchise.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Gore is the more infuriating, because he's such a
hypocrite,'' Nader added. ``He doesn't know who he is any more.
He's a plastic person.'' He also called Gore an ``environmental
imposter'' who supports trade treaties that subordinate the
environment and a ``gee-whiz techno-twit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's disdains Gore and Bush equally as ``indentured'' to the
corporate interests that hold sway over the political process in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader is positioned to hurt Gore more in the fall election.
A favorite of liberal activists and union members, he is polling
between 5 and 9 percent in some states that are crucial to the vice
president's campaign. He is strongest in California, the linchpin
of Gore's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign is somewhat dismissive of Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The undeniable likelihood is one of two people is going to be
president, Al Gore or George W. Bush,'' said Gore spokesman Chris
Lehane. ``And if you care about progressive causes, you would be
supporting Al Gore. A vote for anyone else is tantamount to a vote
against progressive causes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while trailing Bush and Gore by 40 points or more,
Nader is running third in most polls, ahead of staunch conservative
Pat Buchanan, who as the Reform Party nominee was expected to be
the wild card in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader does not see himself as a ``spoiler'' in this year's
election. He sees himself as a reformer in the mold of movements
that challenged the corrupt political machines in the country's
major cities in the early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they viewed themselves as spoilers,'' he said.
``They viewed themselves as reformers. You can't spoil a system
that's spoiled to the core.''
</P>
<P>
   The political system, he said, has moved from ``legalized
bribery'' of public officials to ``legalized extortion'' by
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party in the United States was organized in Minnesota
in 1984. It is an offshoot of the European Greens, which sprouted
in 1978 in West Germany as a pro-environmental, anti-nuclear
movement. Currently, 79 Greens hold elected offices in 18 states
and Washington, D.C. This year, 177 are running for state, local
and federal offices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their political differences, Nader and Buchanan are
allies in trying to secure a place for themselves in the
presidential debates this fall. They have filed suit together
challenging the legality of the corporate-funded Commission on
Presidential Debates, which has set standards for inclusion in the
debates that could bar Nader and Buchanan _ specifically, a minimum
15 percent standing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Nader has run for president, but it
is the most serious effort by the 66-year-old public interest
lawyer. In 1992, he briefly promoted a ``none-of-the-above''
candidacy in New Hampshire. And in 1996, he allowed his name to be
placed on the ballot in several states, but did not campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, he has already visited all 50 states and is
trying to get on the ballots of at least 45. Since accepting the
Green Party's nomination last Sunday, he has begun assembling a
campaign headquarters staff of 21 people and a field staff of at
least 30 organizers.
</P>
<P>
   He also has set a fund-raising goal of $5 million. ``We get a
lot more out of $5 million than the other candidates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Nader's name recognition is helpful in some parts of the
country, he admitted. While he mostly depends on news coverage of
rallies and ``word of mouth'' for exposure, he also said he will
try to ``push the frontier'' with his campaign Web site, conducting
some live events on it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he will try to advertise some this fall. He already
has hired Bill Hillsman, the advertising whiz whose television
spots helped put former pro wrestler Jesse Ventura in the
governor's mansion in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Nader's chief issues arise from his distrust
of corporations. He wants to end ``corporate welfare'' tax
loopholes, institute a system of public financing of political
campaigns, renegotiate international trade agreements and
strengthen labor laws and environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But most of his campaign rhetoric flows from his advocacy of an
all-out effort by the federal government to end child poverty in
the United States. His solution involves universal health care and
a ``national minimum income'' for poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't abolish child poverty now, we will never abolish
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a 66-year-old bachelor, came to national prominence in
1965 with the publication of the book ``Unsafe at Any Speed,''
which criticized the safety standards of the auto industry. Since
then, he has established a number of public interest organizations,
helping to finance them by donating about 80 percent of his
earnings from royalties and fees.
</P>
<P>
   He lives austerely on $25,000 a year in a rented apartment in
Washington. But his anti-corporate image took a hit recently when
he disclosed that he has personal assets total close to $4 million,
much of it earned through investments.

   LIGHT FARE FOR THE FALL
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it was the prospect of the long holiday weekend
or just the summer heat, but this has been a sizzling week for deal
makers on and off Broadway, giving shape to the coming season and a
sense of security to newly hired actors, playwrights and myriad
theater populi.
</P>
<P>
   First, some trend spotting. After several seasons packed with
serious fare, the fall is looking considerably lighter. The latest
indication is Neil Simon's ``Dinner Party,'' which opened last week
at the Kennedy Center in Washington. The Washington Post called the
play, which stars Henry Winkler, John Ritter and Len Cariou,
``laugh out-loud funny,'' adding that it was Simon's ``emotionally
richest play.''
</P>
<P>
   With reviews like that, producers don't have to be told twice.
Emanuel Azenberg, Simon's longtime producer, said he would bring
the play to Broadway in October, in association with Ira Pittelman
and Gordon Davidson, artistic director of Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles, where the play had its premiere last year.
</P>
<P>
   Industry gossip suggests that ``The Dinner Party'' will land at
the Walter Kerr Theater. That house, however, has also been
mentioned for ``Proof,'' David Auburn's drama, now at the Manhattan
Theater Club. There's no definite word on that play's future, but
this week brought word that Mary-Louise Parker, the star of
``Proof,'' has apparently opted out of the Roundabout Theater
Company's fall production of ``Desire Under the Elms.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Dinner Party,'' it joins another comedy, ``The Tale of
the Allergist's Wife'' by Charles Busch and a couple of revivals
that mix sugar and salt: Jane Wagner's ``Search for Signs of
Intelligent Life in the Universe'' from 1985 and Gore Vidal's 1960
political satire ``The Best Man.'' (More on that guy later.)
</P>
<P>
   Other transfers were in the works. From London via California is
``Lifegame,'' an improvisational piece from the Improbable Theater,
the British troupe behind mind-bending works like ``70 Hill Lane''
(a metaphysical magic show) and ``Shockheaded Peter'' (a morbidly
hilarious children's operetta).
</P>
<P>
   This time the work is even less predictable: Each night, an
audience member is picked at random (and in advance) to share his
or her life story, portions of which are then re-enacted by the
cast of eight.
</P>
<P>
   The show is currently at the La Jolla Playhouse in California.
David Stone, who has done very nicely with two unconventional
pieces, ``The Vagina Monologues'' and ``Fully Committed,'' heads a
four-member New York producing team.
</P>
<P>
   And after a brief run at Dance Theater Workshop in Chelsea,
producers of the Foundry Theater's ``And God Created Great Whales''
confirmed that that they would move even farther downtown. This
surreal exploration of ``Moby-Dick'' begins a monthlong run at the
Salon at 45 Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   SOMETHING NEW
</P>
<P>
   There was also action in the nonprofit realm, where the trend is
running headlong toward new plays. At the Drama Department the new
season will include three New York premieres: ``The Dazzle,'' a
play by Richard Greenberg; an untitled play ``about racism and
sweet potatoes,'' written by and starring the quirky comic siblings
Amy and David Sedaris; and ``The Big Time,'' the first musical by
the company's artistic director, Douglas Carter Beane.
</P>
<P>
   At the Signature Company, meanwhile, the next two seasons will
be filled by new works, each by one of the company's guest
playwrights from the last decade. (The company devotes each season
to a single playwright, often choosing lesser-known works from the
writer's canon.)
</P>
<P>
   For the fall the Signature plans to present ``A Lesson Before
Dying,'' a new adaptation of the Ernest Gaines novel by Romulus
Linney (1991-92 season), as well as the ``The Last of the
Thorntons,'' a premiere from Horton Foote (1994-95) that is already
cast with Mason Adams, Estelle Parsons and Hallie Foote, the
playwright's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The final entry of the season, ``Urban Zulu Mambo,'' is a
tribute to Adrienne Kennedy, who was the Signature's writer in
residence in 1995-96. ``Mambo'' was written by a quartet of
African-American women _ Regina Taylor, Ntozake Shange, Kia
Corthron and Suzan-Lori Parks _ and is performed by Taylor. Two of
the ``Mambo'' writers will also be represented elsewhere. Parks'
new play, ``Topdog/Underdog,'' is on next season's roster at the
Public Theater, along with ``Kit Marlowe,'' a new play by David
Grimm; ``Book of the Dead,'' a music theater piece by John Moran;
and ``Dog-eaters,'' a play about 1980s Manila by Jessica Hagedorn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile a new play by Corthron, ``Force Continuum,'' is part
of the Atlantic Theater Company's 2000-01 season, along with Tom
Donaghy's ``Beginning of August,'' directed by Neil Pepe.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARY CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best Man'' has found its best man, and it's Mr. Big.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Chris Noth, best known for playing Mr. Big, Sarah
Jessica Parker's elusive paramour on HBO's ``Sex in the City,''
will be making his Broadway debut in September in ``The Best Man.''
Noth will play Joe Cantwell, a consummate politician (think RFK) in
the revival, which opens on Sept. 17 at the Virginia Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Noth, a Yale Drama graduate and a veteran of NBC's ``Law and
Order,'' said he was yearning to be back onstage but was surprised
by the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked that they're actually doing drama on Broadway,''
he said on the set of ``Sex and the City.'' ``I thought: `Wow,
they're doing this? I gotta be there.'''
</P>
<P>
   ALONG THE WAY
</P>
<P>
   _ Few details yet, but it looks as if the master magician Ricky
Jay will return to Broadway next spring in a new show directed by
David Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' with Gabriel Byrne, Roy
Dotrice and Cherry Jones, closes on Broadway on Sunday, but there
is talk of a London run in late winter. There are a couple of
potential snags, however. Byrne and Dotrice have a new ABC series
in the works, ``Madigan Men.'' Byrne has also been entertaining
another Broadway engagement, for spring 2001.

&HT;     HMOS IN SHOWDOWN WITH CONGRESS OVER MEDICARE FUNDING

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The association representing managed-care health
plans warned Thursday that its members are likely to drop coverage
of more than 700,000 people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, the group said, is that the government pays the
plans too little per patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are staggering and tragic,'' said Karen Ignagni,
president of American Association of Health Plans, at a news
conference. ``For hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries,
today is the day Washington has failed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignagni released a survey conducted by the Washington-based
polling firm, Peter D. Hart Research Associates Inc. The study
showed that 18 of 37 health plans responding to the survey said
they will drop coverage of Medicare patients in at least one area
or region they serve. The 37 plans represent about 85 percent of
all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 711,055 beneficiaries will be affected, Ignagni said.
That's 11 percent of the 6.2 million Medicare beneficiaries who
have signed up with managed-care plans, or health maintenance
organizations (HMOs), and 1.8 percent of all 39 million people in
Medicare, the government's health system for the elderly and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the survey was the latest salvo in the HMOs'
battle to get Congress to approve more Medicare funds for them. The
fight is likely to last until Congress adjourns this fall for the
November elections.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the HMOs' threat shows how pressure politics
works in Washington, with millions of dollars and health-care
options for thousands of senior citizens riding on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, the Clinton administration downplayed the managed
care industry's dire predictions. ``Medicare beneficiaries who are
affected by plans leaving Medicare should remember that no matter
what, they are still covered by a strong Medicare program,'' said
Nancy-Ann DeParle, administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which runs Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Although managed care has been available through Medicare since
the mid-1980s, Congress in 1997 set up a national payment structure
for reimbursing HMOs for covering Medicare patients. Congress named
it Medicare-Plus-Choice.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people now receiving health care through managed
care plans has doubled since the end of 1995. Managed care under
Medicare is similar to managed care in the private sector. Patients
are limited in terms of selecting doctors and hospitals but receive
treatment at a reduced cost.
</P>
<P>
   Senior citizens may select Medicare-Plus-Choice or retain
Medicare's traditional fee-for-service coverage. Under
fee-for-service, patients may choose the doctor or hospital they
want and Medicare pays a set rate. Patients pick up the balance
either through extra ``Medigap'' insurance or out of their own
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   For Medicare beneficiaries, the main attraction of
Medicare-Plus-Choice is drug coverage _ a benefit that greatly
reduces the skyrocketing cost of prescription medicines. About 63
percent of beneficiaries have such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ignagni vowed to press Congress for
higher payment formulas. Under Medicare, plans are ``overregulated
and underfunded,'' she said. ``This day did not have to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount the government pays each plan for Medicare service
depends largely on geography. This year, in some sections of New
York (with a lot of wealth and competition between doctors and
hospitals), Medicare pays plans as much as $814 per patient per
month.
</P>
<P>
   But some rural areas of Minnesota receive the minimum _ $401 per
patient per month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the plans succeeded in getting an extra $1.3 billion
from Congress for their Medicare services. HMOs now get about $45
billion a year from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Ignagni said health plans need an extra $13 billion to $15
billion over five years to keep their Medicare patient programs
economically viable. The Republican Medicare prescription drug plan
that passed the House Wednesday contains $3.5 billion for health
plans serving Medicare patients. Ignagni said this drug funding
would not allow any boosts in the overall payment formula.
</P>
<P>
   Some major plans have already announced they are dropping
Medicare coverage. Cigna Corp. has said it will end its program
covering 104,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 states. Among the
areas hit are Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York City, Houston and
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare announced Thursday that it will drop
Medicare HMO coverage in 11 states: Connecticut, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Ohio, Texas and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Aetna said it will drop Medicare participants in
five counties north and east of New York City _ Nassau, Suffolk,
Orange, Putnam and Dutchess _ and seven counties in Northern
California _ Alameda, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Sacramento, San
Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara. In all, the Aetna withdrawals
will affect 355,000 Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Providence Health Plans of Portland, Ore.
announced it will discontinue its Medicare coverage in eight
counties in Oregon and southern Washington, affecting 6,000 of its
53,000 Medicare enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   But not all plans are abandoning Medicare. PacifiCare Health
Systems Inc. of Santa Ana, Calif. will announce next Wednesday only
``minimal changes'' in its coverage of nearly a million Medicare
patients in eight states _ Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,
Oregon, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington, according to spokeswoman
Cheryl Brady.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already decided it will not drop any of its
575,000 Medicare enrollees in California, its biggest market.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, health plans announced coverage cuts
that affected 327,000 Medicare beneficiaries. And in 1998, similar
cuts ended managed care for 407,000 beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   However, only 24 percent of the 327,000 and 12.5 percent of the
407,000 were left with no other Medicare managed care plan in their
area, according to the government's HCFA.

AFTER 3,000-MILE JOURNEY, CAT'S NUMBER JUST WASN'T UP

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Perhaps it was tragedy that caused Lapis to roam.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the black-and-white cat vanished from her home in
Boulder, Colo., Lapis's brother, Hoki, had been put down by a
veterinarian's needle because of an incurable kidney ailment. That
was April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the sweet-natured shorthair on top of the
other cat's death was devastating to owner Jennifer Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried and cried. I loved her so much,'' said Hill, 33, a
graduate student of social work at the University of Denver. ``I
posted signs, I placed ads, I called the animal shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs yielded nothing but false leads, ditto the
classifieds. Animal shelter workers could offer only sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But this kitty's tale has a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Lapis the cat is back purring on the lap of her owner, returned
earlier this week after an epic feline journey of nearly 3,000
miles to Canada's Far North _ all the way to Champagne Landing,
Yukon Territory, pop. 15, located nearer the Arctic Circle than the
United States border.
</P>
<P>
   How the pink-nosed wayfarer could wander so far is a mystery.
The best guess is she hopped into the back of a truck or camper,
and either leaped to freedom during a pit stop near Champagne
Landing _ or was pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the discovery of Lapis is the biggest thing to happen
around Champagne Landing since the Alaska Highway was built through
in 1942. The former gold rush trading post and Indian burial site
hasn't lately even rated a place on the map _ it's too tiny to
qualify as a hamlet by Canadian government definition, so most
cartographers don't bother with it.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone noticed the five-pound furry stranger who
sashayed into the settlement last month, while Hill was still
futilely seeking kitty far, far to the south.
</P>
<P>
   There was Edward Chambers, 65, whose mutt, B.V., chased the
newcomer up a tree. ``Dog wouldn't stop barking, but I thought
nothing of it,'' said the retired businessman. ``Sure I figured the
cat was from away _ Whitehorse, maybe. Not the other side of the
Rockies.''
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, the errant cat was spied again rooting after
field mice near the home of Chambers' mother-in-law. Then spotted
prowling the Indian burial ground. Chambers' son-in-law, David
Grant, remarked that it seemed odd a stray cat should have such a
pretty blue collar. Odder still that it hadn't been gobbled by
coyotes, wolves or other predators that make a cat's life in the
wild country a perilous one. Finally Grant's niece, Susan, checked
out the tag _ puzzling at the phone number with the unfamiliar area
code.
</P>
<P>
   Grant called Hill. The Colorado woman was incredulous,
wondering, just for starters, where the heck the Yukon was? But she
was delighted to learn that her runaway appeared to be faring just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She survived up there because she's a real good mouser,'' Hill
said. ``She may be a little kitty, but she's tough and
resourceful.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughie's trials and travels weren't over. Grant drove the
cat to Whitehorse, the territorial capital, buying a cat cage at
the Canadian Tire store and trying to check her aboard the most
direct flight south. But because of a heat wave in Colorado, the
airline refused to carry an unaccompanied cat to Denver
International.
</P>
<P>
   So Lapis was flown to Hill's sister, Elizabeth, in San
Francisco. From where Hill retrieved her on Wednesday, 70 days
after the cat went missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got home, she ate a can of tuna, then played with her
toys,'' Hill said. ``Then went to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Lapis, for shuteye is something that Hill and the folk in
Champagne Landing are finding hard to come by these days, as the
phones ring and ring from media around the world. BBC calling.
People Magazine here. Australian radio on the line, mate. The New
York Post. Fox Network. Everyone loves a cat yarn.
</P>
<P>
   But is there a moral to it all? Any deeper lesson for us all?
</P>
<P>
   You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always put your cat's number on the collar,'' Hill advised.
``Because you just never know where she'll turn up.''

UGANDANS VOTE ON HOW THEY WISH TO BE GOVERNED 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABALE, Uganda _ Ugandans voted Thursday in an unusual
referendum on how they want to be governed, a question tied deeply
to the violence of the nation's past and the popularity of
President Yoweri Museveni, the man who has, in large measure, ended
that violence.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout among Uganda's 9.6 million voters appeared relatively
light _ which Museveni's opponents said showed the success of their
call for a boycott. But apart from trying to avoid the rain in many
parts of Uganda, voters also may have stayed home because the
election's result, in Museveni's favor, never seemed in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Museveni very much,'' said Sugra Khan, 69, after
casting her vote in a drizzle at a near-empty soccer field in this
southwestern town early Thursday morning. ``Now we have no
problems. I am sleeping well.''
</P>
<P>
   Khan said she cast her vote from her life: In the 1970s the
dictator Idi Amin _ responsible for as many as 500,000 deaths _
expelled some 70,000 Ugandans of Asian descent, among them her own
family.
</P>
<P>
   The choice in the referendum was whether to return to a
multi-party system or to continue the so-called ``Movement'' system
favored by Museveni, president since he won a five-year guerrilla
war in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Movement, political parties are permitted in name
only. Museveni's argument is that political parties have divided
Ugandans by tribe and religion, allowing men like Amin and Milton
Obote, whom Museveni overthrew, to take power.
</P>
<P>
   The question echoes the debate about whether African nations _
lacking a middle class that votes its economic interests rather
than its tribal or religious ties _ are politically mature enough
for the same kind of democracy practiced by rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni's opponents _ supporters of a multi-party system _
depict the Movement as a one-party state that he manipulates to
stay in power. The Movement bans party conventions and rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of dictatorship,'' said Nasser Sebaggala, the
former mayor of the capital, Kampala, who plans to run for
president next year against Museveni. ``People want a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, opponents of Museveni called for a boycott of the
election: They have mounted a legal challenge against the
parliamentary vote that established the referendum and say that, at
any rate, the process is stacked against them. Proponents of many
parties were not permitted to appear on the ballot as separate
parties or personalities but rather as an idea, while Museveni has
been able to campaign as the public face of the Movement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Sebaggala said people boycotted the
vote in huge numbers, though it was impossible to tell because the
results will not be known until Saturday at the earliest. By law,
results must be released within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on all sides say the results will be significant
nonetheless, as an early indication for the more important
elections next year for both the parliament and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential elections, in 1996, Museveni won
three-quarters of the vote, with about three-quarters of the
electorate going to the polls. A similar result would give Museveni
a boost into next year's elections, while his opponents are certain
to capitalize on any weakening in his past high levels of support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Movement officials have been bracing for a low turnout, saying
that Ugandans have voted often enough that they have begun to take
that right for granted. That explanation was echoed Thursday by the
assistant town clerk in Mbabara, who was also a local election
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are educated are starting to talk about why
should they be bothered,'' he said. ``There is fatigue. I don't see
people getting excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Museveni has campaigned on his record _ what he says are huge
strides in economic growth, education and infrastructure, as well
as much more peace and stability than in the past. His opponents
say Ugandans are still poor, that 700,000 people have been
displaced by two rebellions and most Ugandans oppose Museveni's
involvement in the rebellion in neighboring Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But some voters are separating the candidates from the issues,
and in particular Museveni from the Movement. Allen Kyomugasho, a
65-year-old shopkeeper in Mbabara, said she likes Museveni but
voted Thursday to bring back political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Museveni,'' said Kyomugasho. ``I just want a
change.''

 &HT;    JUSTICE: STRICTER SUPERVISION OF RELIGIOUS VISAS NEEDED
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing reports where people fraudulently obtained
religious worker visas, the Justice Department told a House
committee Thursday that stricter supervision of the program is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the House Judiciary Committee on Immigration and
Claims, however, said changes to the non-minister religious worker
immigrant visa program would violate the ethics of certain
religious sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The INS and the State Department identified several fraud
schemes where applicants lied to obtain visas and never worked for
a religious organization in the United States. The Justice
Department recommended toughening requirements for religious visas,
including requiring proof of previous religious experience and
documenting full-time, paid employment in a religious organization
upon arrival here.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 5,000 immigrants obtain visas every year to work
for U.S. religious groups, according to a March 1999 General
Accounting Office report. An INS investigation found a pastor who
filed 450 visa petitions that covered more than 900 people
falsified the number of years applicants were members of the
church. Another case involved 30 Fiji citizens living in the U.S.
who applied for religious worker visas because their visitors visas
had expired. As a result, INS now requires the sponsoring
organization to submit evidence regarding their ability to
financially support the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The visa program) was not intended to provide religious
denominations with the ability to obtain green cards for members of
their congregation, particularly on a revolving-door basis, without
a bona fide intention to employ them for religious work,'' said
Jess Ford who testified on behalf of the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the visa applications do not specify what type of
religious work is necessary to qualify. John Brennan, director for
visa services for the State Department, said sponsoring
organizations use that to their advantage and sometimes file
hundreds of petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consular officers are presented with claims that a variety of
seemingly mundane jobs with no clear traditional religious function
are religious occupations because they are somehow related to the
overall work of a religious organization,'' Brennan said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department recommendation would discriminate
against religious groups like the Sisters of Charity, a
congregation of Catholic nuns started by Mother Teresa, said Rep.
Zoe Lofgren D-Calif. She cited a letter written by Mother Teresa
asking Congress to continue issuing visas to religious workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sisters of Charity are not paid, they serve the poor
without compensation,'' Zoe said. ``To request a pay stub would be
counterintuitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., echoed Zoe's concern and said, ``We
would end up excluding some religious groups because of their
religious beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although fraud cases have been identified, ``much more serious''
cases exist in other segments of immigration applications, said
Mildred Patterson, the State Department's managing director. The
GAO report does not provide the number of fraud cases, but
Patterson said they are low.

KOHL CRITICIZES HIS TREATMENT DURING INVESTIGATION OF PARTY
FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating to correct slug. Moved earlier as GERMANY-POLITICS)   By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ With a swaggering contempt for his accusers, former
chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared Thursday before a parliamentary
committee investigating financial misdeeds under his rule and said
he was a victim of slander.
</P>
<P>
   In hours of rambling testimony and subsequent exchanges with
journalists, Kohl, who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998, said the
parliamentary investigation amounted to ``an attempt to drag 16
good years through the mud'' and an ``act of unprecedented
defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   His stance was consistent with the defiance he has shown since
his admission last December that he had taken about $1 million in
undeclared, and so illicit, payments from donors and used the money
to bolster his Christian Democratic party in the formerly communist
eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who took the money between 1993 and 1998, has refused to
name the donors, and on Thursday he said that he had ``no intention
of naming them.'' Just as he had given his word that Germany would
give up the mark for the euro, so he had promised that the donors
would remain anonymous, he added.
</P>
<P>
   His attempt to draw an analogy between a promise that Germany
would adopt Europe's common currency and a promise that illegal
donations would remain secret was the latest of a series of odd
declarations from Kohl. Last week, he compared the ostracism he
believes he is suffering to that of the Jews under Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned about that much-criticized reference to the
persecution of Jews, Kohl, 70, shot back: ``I do not need any
private tuition on history. As far as the relationship with the
Jews is concerned, I suggest you go to Jerusalem or Tel Aviv. There
you will find out who among living German politicians is held in
highest regard.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unquestionable that Kohl's international reputation
remains high, a tribute above all to his deft handling of German
unification in 1990. But the hubris he has shown as his party has
reeled from a scandal involving the revelation that millions of
dollars were paid in secret to the Christian Democrats has hurt his
domestic standing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This had been an unprecedented attempt to defame me through
inaccurate reports, insinuations and twisting of the facts to
criminalize me,'' Kohl told the parliamentary committee. He singled
out reports in the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and ``on that
e-mail thing _ whatever it's called _ I mean, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Kohl veered between anger and jocularity.
When the proceedings began a little late, the former chancellor
shouted: ``Mr. Chairman, when may we commence this zoological
event?''
</P>
<P>
   His testimony came the day after Burkhard Hirsch, a former vice
president of the parliament, told the committee that in the days
after Kohl's electoral defeat in September 1998, most of the files
in the chancellery were destroyed. ``This massive erasure of data
had no legal basis,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl dismissed as ``stupid'' anyone who could believe that
millions of files had been destroyed, insisting that all the people
around him were ``honorable'' and that there was no motive for such
an act of destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said Wednesday that computer experts had managed to
retrieve one file showing that letters ostensibly written by four
state premiers calling on the government not to investigate
privatizations in the former East Germany had in fact been prepared
in the chancellery.
</P>
<P>
   One of these privatizations, that of the Leuna oil refinery, has
been the object of particular scrutiny because of the apparently
inflated price paid for it by Elf Aquitaine of France and because
of evidence that kickbacks were paid to several agents.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl said accusations that the sale was corrupt and that his
party may have benefited from the kickbacks were ``a scandalous
distortion of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``It became clear that it was going to be hard to
find an investor for Leuna. In the end, only Elf showed the
necessary commitment. I spoke to President Mitterrand and he agreed
that the involvement of a large French company in Leuna would have
great psychological significance in the former East Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement appeared to be the first time that Kohl had
acknowledged speaking to Mitterrand about the sale before it went
through. The French president had been wary of German unification;
the transaction became a symbol of restored political trust between
Europe's central allies.
</P>
<P>
   As for another suspect sale _ that of 36 German tanks to Saudi
Arabia in 1991 _ Kohl said it was made with the express blessing of
former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker after the United States
criticized Germany for not sending troops to help the Allied effort
to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no knowledge of bribery in this deal,'' Kohl said. ``It
did not happen. I have never been corrupt.'' The former
second-ranking military official in his government, Ludwig-Holger
Pfahls, has disappeared after being accused of receiving $2 million
in a Swiss bank account for his role in facilitating the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The former chancellor, who has raised over $3 million to pay
back a fine imposed on the party for its actions under his rule,
said more than once that he had ``made mistakes.'' But he also said
more than once that he was not and had never been ``for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary investigation is expected to end later this
year. It will make recommendations on campaign financing and give a
detailed account of Kohl's actions. But the former chancellor is
very unlikely to face any formal sanction.

 &HT;    Senate passes bill restricting political groupsBy Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett scored a major victory
Thursday when the Senate approved a measure to limit the power of
secretive political groups like the one that bankrolled attack ads
against Arizona Sen. John McCain during his bruising Republican
presidential primary with Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would force the non-profit groups created under
section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code to tell the IRS when they
are formed and to file reports listing major contributors and
expenditures. The measure _ a compromise based on initiatives
pushed by Doggett and McCain _ passed the House earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton applauded the bill's passage and said he looks
forward to signing it, ``as a first step toward meaningful campaign
finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   That was good news for Doggett, who had hoped to make the
measure retroactive to the beginning of the tax year. The bill
becomes effective when Clinton signs it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This quick Senate action on modest reform is important, since
every day the bill goes without the president's signature is one
more day for disclosure opponents to fill their war chests with
secret money . . .,'' said Doggett, who also called the compromise
measure, ``far from perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Democrat emerged as one of the chief proponents for
shining the light on so-called Stealth PACS. And though the measure
is narrower than some lawmakers had wanted, winning approval for
any campaign reform is difficult on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Frances R. Hill, a University of Miami law professor, said the
measure is, ``an enormous step forward.'' But she also said it is
too vague about when the IRS must make information from the groups
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should say that they really mean to implement this and
there will be public disclosure before the 2000 elections,'' Hill
said. ``I don't think the American people should be deprived of
this information now that Congress has enacted this bill simply
because it would be a little inconvenient to the Internal Revenue
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups of all political stripes have formed so-called 527s. The
Sierra Club formed one in 1996 and Scott Reed, manager of former
senator Bob Dole's 1996 White House bid, created one to help the
GOP reach out to Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, touts the Republican Majority
Issues Committee, whose mission is to keep the House in GOP hands.
DeLay was the sole member of the House Republican leadership to
oppose the measure. Republican Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Phil Gramm voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   It was a $2.5 million ad campaign, paid for by a longtime Bush
backer, that sparked outcry on Capitol Hill. The group, Republicans
for Clean Air, launched the campaign slamming McCain's
environmental record in three critical states before the May 7
primaries. Media reports revealed that Sam Wyly and his brother,
Charles, were behind the group.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy has been the hallmark of the non-profit groups formed
under section 527. They do not have to tell the IRS when they
organize or file tax returns or make public any information about
their contributors, spending or how they operate. Nonprofit groups
formed under other sections of the tax code are required to
disclose such information.
</P>
<P>
   The 527 groups run television and radio ads, send mailings and
make telephone calls to voters _ all legal so long as they do not
explicitly call for the election or defeat of a particular
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure that cleared Congress, section 527 groups that
``reasonably anticipate'' annual gross receipts of $25,000 or more
would be subject to federal campaign law. They would have to file
tax returns and identify contributors of $200 or more and
expenditures of $500 or more. They also would have to report
contributors and expenditures to the Internal Revenue Service every
three months during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Violators could be subject to a 35 percent tax on contributions
and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger applauded Doggett,
``for his persistence and determination in bringing this important
reform to the floor.''

FOR $6.9 BILLION, FORD WINS RIGHT TO BID FOR DAEWOO MOTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Ford Motor Co. on Thursday won exclusive
rights to negotiate the purchase of South Korea's ailing Daewoo
Motor Co. with a $6.9 billion offer that, if successful, would be
Ford's largest foreign acquisition and could significantly
strengthen its operations in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, the world's second largest automaker, outbid rivals
including No. 1 General Motors Corp. for the right to negotiate a
purchase of Daewoo from its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating price, which was higher than had been expected,
does not include the assumption of any of Daewoo's estimated $18
billion in debt. Ford now has six weeks to conduct a so-called due
diligence review of Daewoo, and could conceivably decide to adjust
its offering price or withdraw from negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Yong-keun, chairman of South Korea's Financial Supervisory
Commission, which has been overseeing the auction process for
Daewoo Motor, said Ford ``offered the best terms and the Daewoo
Restructuring Committee and creditors chose it as the exclusive
negotiator after what I heard was a difficult selection process.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Ford seemed to be the weakest candidate, as it
competed against an alliance of GM and Fiat SpA and an alliance of
DaimlerChrysler AG and Hyundai Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   On top of its Mazda Corp. unit in Japan, Ford could use the
acquisition of Daewoo to make South Korea a new production base in
Asia, a region that is expected to lead the world incar sales over
the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition of Daewoo Motor would be just the latest in a
string of purchases for Ford. Earlier this year, Ford agreed to buy
the Land Rover sport-utility-vehicle unit from BMW AG for $3
billion, and last year it purchased Sweden's Volvo Car Corp. from
Volvo AB for more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the announcement, David Snyder, head
of Ford's Asia-Pacific operation, sought to appease concerns by
South Koreans that there would be widespread layoffs at Daewoo
Motor factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek the best way for all concerned-the employees, the
suppliers and the creditors and customers _ to normalize operations
at Daewoo at the earliest possible date,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor is capable of producing 2 million vehicles annually
at plants in South Korea and abroad. But the carmaker, a showcase
subsidiary of the financially ailing Daewoo conglomerate, has
struggled with heavy debts and losses. Last year it lost $3.9
billion on revenue of $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Ford was a disappointment for GM, which had long
been considered the favored contender for Daewoo Motor. John
Mueller, a GM spokesman, declined to disclose what the GM-Fiat
alliance had bid for the company and did not rule out further
efforts to buy Daewoo Motor should Ford's negotiations falter.
</P>
<P>
   Although creditors and Daewoo officials said they did not expect
obstacles in the Ford negotiations, Oh Hogen, head of the Daewoo
Restructuring Committee, conceded that talks could be held again
with the DaimlerChrysler-Hyundai and GM-Fiat bidders if no
agreement were reached with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Although DaimlerChrysler said it was not disappointed, its
partner, Hyundai Motor, could face a significant threat from a Ford
purchase of Daewoo. Hyundai Motor would face increasing competition
in a market where it holds a 65.7 percent stake. Daewoo's market
share is estimated at around 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means Hyundai Motor would have to expand its relationship
with DaimlerChrysler,'' said Joe Lee, an automotive industry
analyst at Daiwa Securities.

<P>
   HAMADAN, Iran _ In his spare time, Nejad Rassad, one of only 35
Jews left in this ancient city, tends a building believed to be the
mausoleum of Esther, the Jewish queen of Persia who saved her
people from annihilation 2,400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He is happy to unlock the thick granite door, bend low to enter
the dim vaulted crypt, translate the Hebrew words carved on the
queen's ebony tomb and then recount in colorful detail the biblical
story of Esther and the endangered Jewish community redeemed long
ago by royal intervention. But Rassad, a gaunt 52-year-old teacher
impeccably turned out in a summer business suit, became abruptly
silent this week when the drama of modern Iran's Jews was
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that,'' he said when asked about
spy charges brought by an Iranian revolutionary court against 13
Jewish men from the Iranian cities of Esfahan and Shiraz. ``Life is
good here,'' he added. ``Don't ask me anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, which took place in a closed courtroom in Shiraz the
past two months, has deeply shaken many of the 30,000 Jews in Iran,
with some moved to willful silence and others to thoughts of
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   A verdict is to be announced on Saturday. While the chief
justice in Shiraz has said no defendant faces the death penalty,
some diplomats in Tehran say at least some will be convicted and
spend time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 men _ most of them shop clerks or teachers and the
youngest a student of 18 _ are accused of spying for Israel. After
nearly 15 months in prison, several confessed to giving information
to Israelis during secret trips to visit relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But their lawyers have argued that the confessions are invalid
and that no evidence shows that the information they are supposed
to have passed was classified.
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn intense international interest, with Jewish
and human rights groups criticizing the secret proceedings and the
treatment of the accused, especially those paraded on state
television to repeat their confessions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, France, Russia and other nations have made it
an issue in their dealings with Iran, calling on President Mohammad
Khatami to ensure that the Jews' trial is conducted fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats in Tehran have seen a political motivation behind
the case, suggesting it was a cynical move by Islamic conservatives
to scuttle Khatami's fledgling rapprochement with the west. For
their part, many Iranian officials in the judiciary and in the
Khatami government, have bridled at the attention from outside,
calling it unwarranted interference in Iran's internal affairs
</P>
<P>
   But behind the political debate the case has had more
ramifications for the Jews of Iran who are trying to assess its
meaning in the context of their own personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   In private, many said the spy case was a reminder of how
capricious the Iranian system could be and how easily suspicions
raised against a few Jews could affect the lives of all Jews in a
country that regards Israel as its archenemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Jews leaving the country now,'' said Morris
Mottamed, a Tehran engineer who represents the country's Jews in
the Iranian Parliament, where religious minorities are each
allotted one seat. ``And I would say that about 40 to 50 percent of
the Jews are thinking of leaving Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   While an exodus that large has not materialized, private groups
in Europe and the United States that assist Jewish immigration
acknowledged that the numbers of Iranian Jews seeking their help
has increased sharply in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from some of those groups would only say that the
numbers are still relatively small, but that the spy case has them
concerned about a potential rush of Jews seeking to leave Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In Shiraz, where most of the espionage case defendants and their
families live, anxiety spills out in private conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have made up their minds _ they're leaving,'' said a
Jewish shopkeeper who agreed to a furtive chat. ``The TV is saying
that Jews are spies.''
</P>
<P>
   He was panicked and fearful of starting a new life. ``If I sell
my business and convert the money into dollars, I won't get much,''
the man said. ``What can I do? What am I going to do with my
father? His generation worked and worked and now it's for nothing.
He loves this country. I love this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, if the Islamic Republic said to us, `don't walk on
the sidewalk,' we wouldn't walk on the sidewalk,'' the shopkeeper
added. ``But now, watch, in a year, half of the Jews here will be
gone.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Jews of Iran trace their origins to sixth century B.C., when
Cyrus, the Persian empire-builder, conquered Babylon and freed the
Jewish slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Cities like Shiraz and Hamadan, once the summer retreat for
Persian rulers, developed vibrant Jewish minorities and well-tended
shrines, like that of the prophet Daniel in Shush and that of Queen
Esther.
</P>
<P>
   But since the creation of Israel in 1948, and then after the
1979 Islamic revolution that transformed Iran into a theocratic
state, much of Iran's Jewish population emigrated to other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remained said they simply learned to adjust to the new
Islamic regime's requirements, like the obligatory headscarf and
cloak for women and the prohibition of many books, films and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any restrictions on the Jews after the
revolution that weren't imposed on all Iranians,'' said Dr. Simon
Shabani, a Jewish physician in Hamadan. ``Some people could put up
with it better than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Shabani might move, but only to Tehran, so that his three
children could go to Hebrew school and his wife could be close to a
larger Jewish community. But he, for one, said he feels untouched
by the tensions around the spy case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want a nice peaceful life,'' he said. ``These 13
couldn't have been ordinary people. There must have been
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran recognizes its Jews as an officially accepted religious
minority, letting them observe their religious ceremonies and
services, teach Hebrew to their children and operate Jewish
community centers and youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   Still, although some like Shabani said they feel comfortable, a
degree of watchfulness often runs through their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Shiraz, some of the 5,000 Jews who still live in the city
sometimes gather for weekend picnics in the summer. But they always
ask for government permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to cause any trouble,'' said Isach Niknava, the
head of the Shiraz Jewish community. ``It's more relaxing to have
the permission in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Mottamed said he hopes to dissuade his constituents from leaving
out of anxiety over the Jewish spy case. Iranian officials, he
added, have assured him that the case is not religiously motivated
and that they do not wish to see an exodus of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the Iranian government's handling of the espionage trial has
sent a different message. Some defendants were queried about their
religious feelings and their answers were broadcast, along with
their confessions, on the state television channel, which is
controlled by Iranian religious hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish people felt insulted,'' Mottamed said. ``The television
focused on one specific minority and questioned its rights. That's
one reason why many people are thinking of leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
   That reaction to the broadcast has not elicited much sympathy
from Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened at a time when the foreign media had launched a
big propaganda for the Jews,'' said the minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance, Ataollah Mohajerani, in an interview. ``So our
judiciary had to use its instruments to show that the Jews might be
guilty, so it used the state television.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of Iran's Jews do emigrate, he said, that is their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer our Jewish citizens to live here in Iran with us,''
said Mohajerani, considered a moderate in Iran's political
pantheon. ``This is the choice of the individual to decide where he
wants to live.''

&HT;     GORE SAYS GAS PRICES PROVE NEED FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (SUBS 7TH graf to CORRECT spelling of ``report.'' 
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore sought Thursday to convert
public ire about high gasoline prices into support for an ambitious
10-year $25 billion package of federal tax breaks to encourage
cities to expand their public transit systems.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, portrayed
his proposal as an effort to offer Americans new choices for
commuting, rather than a federally mandated bid to oust commuters
from their cars and into crowded rail cars or urban buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be realistic: People want to drive their own cars and
they should have the right always to drive their own cars,'' Gore
told several hundred people gathered on a terrace of Chicago's Navy
Pier. ``Don't tell me that there's a great groundswell to get rid
of cars and push people into mass transit whether they want it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``You deserve the independence to get in your car
and drive anywhere you want to go on your own schedule without
having to empty your wallet at every filling station. You should
also have the choice _ if you want it _ to park your car at the
light rail and be moved swiftly into the newly thriving downtown
without having to worry about gridlock or a parking lot or rush
hour traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore dubbed it an ``old, timid way of thinking'' for Americans
to believe that enhancing environmental protection means ``that to
help the earth you have to give up your own car for a crowded
subway car or turn down your air conditioning or swelter indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices in the Midwest are the highest in the lower 48
states, nation,
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to focus Midwest consumers' ire over skyrocketing
gasoline prices at large oil companies rather that Clinton-Gore
administration policies. He called for a Federal Trade Commission
inquiry into gasoline pricing to conduct public hearings to enable
Americans to hear first hand the explanations of oil executives for
the $2 a gallon cost of the reformulated low-pollution gasoline
that was required in 15 Midwestern urban areas including Chicago
beginning June 1.
</P>
<P>
   FTC spokesman Mitchell Katz said the FTC was conducting a
private investigation and would make a status report to Congress by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on here?'' Gore wondered aloud after citing
soaring profits for oil companies at the outset of this year
despite higher costs for crude oil. The vice president called
gasoline prices ``no less than outrageous,'' adding that the
federal government's quasi-independent FTC ought to ``pursue that
investigation vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said oil companies already are reducing the costs of
gasoline in the hard-hit Midwest now that the industry is faced
with the onslaught of the FTC's subpoena powers, its investigative
staff and the agency's ability to shine the public spotlight into
corporate decision-making at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposal would encourage urban centers to convert
bus fleets to more energy efficient, cleaner engines; create new
light rail systems linking cities to suburbs; and encourage
creation of safe residential and retail communities adjacent to
transit stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there nothing as efficient as a steel wheel on a steel
rail,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Once consumers have alternative ways to commute to work, it will
reduce the oil industry's stranglehold on American commuters, Gore
said. With more rail links available, if ``big oil tries to take
advantage of whatever ability they have to manipulate the prices
and a lot of people say, `I'm not driving this week, I'm going to
make another choice,' then you'll see them start feeling the
pressure from consumers in a new way and they won't be as able to
get away with it.''

   There's nothing like a sense of gloom to pave the way for bad
ideas. The recent surge in gasoline prices has been seized on by
congressional Republicans as justification for opening Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a unique natural asset, to oil
exploration. Doing so would squander one of the nation's last
untouched wildlife preserves without having any impact on the
current energy problem.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi has led the way
in the freshest attempt to assault the refuge by attaching an
energy package to an appropriations bill for the Labor Department
and the Department of Health and Human Services. The tactic of
turning contentious bills into riders on other pieces of
legislation presumed immune to veto is practiced by politicians of
all persuasions, but that does not keep it from being devious.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, senators with a sense of conscience should reject
the move on its merits in addition to the way in which it has been
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5 million acres of northeastern Alaska, bordering the
Beaufort Sea, are home to a wide range of birds and land animals
that enjoy free movement. They are largely undisturbed by human
beings and wholly protected from the industrial-scale intrusions
that necessarily go with petroleum exploration and development.
</P>
<P>
   If the area were the answer to the nation's energy difficulties
the argument might be different. But the highest estimate of oil
that might be found there is about 3 billion barrels _ six months
of American consumption or about two months of global consumption.
Even if exploration started today it is highly unlikely that
production would begin before other factors had changed the
country's energy equation and the sense of emergency had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative predators who play on the distress over gasoline
prices to carve out Alaska's pristine wildlife zone betray their
responsibility to protect national treasures. It is not a pretty
spectacle.

choice in the matter; the will of the people was invoked over and
over, as though it really played a role in the transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after his father's death, Syria's make-believe
parliament removed a barrier to Bashar's succession in 15 minutes.
That's the time it took to amend Article 83 of the Baathist Party's
constitution, changing the minimum age of a Syrian president from
40 to 34, precisely the age of Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   The one nominal lawmaker who had the temerity _ or obtuseness _
to raise a procedural objection to the amendment was permitted to
apologize this week to his colleagues and express his wholehearted
support of Bashar's nomination. ``Your apology is a sign of respect
for this institution,'' the speaker of parliament told Monzir
Moussali, ``and a confession that you have erred.''
</P>
<P>
   Preposterous as it may seem to citizens of real democracies,
Syria's mimickry of democratic procedures may be seen as a tacit
recognition by Assad's inner circle of a yearning for
self-government that the Baathist regime, despite all its spies and
torturers, has never completely expunged from the population of
Syria _ and certainly not from the captive people of a colonized
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   That yearning is expressed in the Soviet-style jokes Syrians and
Lebanese tell about the referendum that will allow more than 99
percent of voters to elect Bashar the next president of Syria. The
real method of changing faces in the regime's ruling group is the
one perfected by the deceased Assad and practiced in the last few
years by his son. A dependent capo is placed in a sinecure where he
can reap the benefits of bribes, kickbacks, and partnerships. Then,
when it suits the supreme leader, a few such officials are purged
for being corrupt. This is the Syrian system of one man, one vote;
the Assad at the top is the one man with the one vote.

DRUG HAS POTENTIAL TO SUPPRESS APPETITE IN HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of John Hopkins University scientists have produced what
seems to be a miracle diet drug capable of turning off appetite
with virtually zero side effects.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only mice have benefitted from the drug's weight loss
powers but doctors are hopeful the technique will one day work in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said a non-toxic substance called C75, injected
into mice, wiped out the animals' interest in food within 20
minutes, tricking the brain into thinking it had been fed. The
result was a remarkably reduced appetite that led to weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not claiming to have found the fabled weight-loss
drug,'' said Dr. Frank Kuhajda, who led the research team at
Baltimore's Johns Hopkins University. ``What we have found, using
C75, is a major pathway in the brain that the body uses naturally
in regulating appetite _ at least in mice.''
</P>
<P>
   The C75 work, the results of which are published in the current
journal Science, comes out of the team's 14-year research on
abnormal fat metabolism that exists in cancer cells. Scientists
discovered cancer cells use ``fatty acid synthase'' or FAS, an
enyzme responsible for transforming carbohydrates into fat, to
produce fat.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers injected mice with a single dose of
C75 and observed them for changes in behavior, weight and body
chemistry. The C75 substance killed the cancer cells without
harming the normal cells. In just 20 minutes, the mice lost their
appetite. Feeding was reduced by 90 percent the first day. It then
returned to normal over the next 48-72 hours as the drug's effects
dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   The injected mice resembled the fasting mice in the way they
lost body tissue, but the injected mice lost more weight than the
untreated mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to lose weight by starving, your metabolism slows
down after a few days,'' Kuhajda. It's a survival mechanism that
sabotages many diets. We see this in fasting mice. Yet the
metabolic rate in the C75 treated mice doesn't slow at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuhajda said that this pathway is different from those found in
over the counter diet drugs like amphetamines, caffeine, and
phen-fen. The difference is that the pathway is found in brain
cells known to control appetite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an entirely new discovery,'' said Hopkins researcher
Craig Townsend. ``Most weight loss drugs are essentially stimulants
that keep you going even though you're not moving. There's not much
out there that really works.''
</P>
<P>
   With 50 percent of the general population classified as
overweight, Americans are spending an increasing amount of money on
quick fix, weight loss drugs. But none of these seem to work.
According to government estimates, one-quarter of Americans are
obese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obesity is a reality and associated with it are a lot of
health problems,'' Townsend said. If something can be done to help
people maintain their weight and control their eating there would
be a lot of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Townsend recognizes C75 as a possible solution to what's become
a serious medical problem. But he emphasizes that the experiment
has only been performed on mice, and it will be many years before
such a product would become available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it worked, it could be a good thing,'' Kuhajda said. ``But
that's assuming that it goes through human safety and all the
trials that it has to go through. We'll just have to see what the
future will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of
Health, Department of Defense and the W.M. Keck Foundation and the
Steward and the Raynam Research Trusts.

   ABORTION-RIGHTS (Undated) _ A day after the Supreme Court
effectively struck down ``partial birth abortion'' bans in some 30
states, people on both sides of the issue said the contentious
debate over the procedures is far from over. Across the country,
supporters and opponents of the bans said they expected a new
generation of laws around the country aimed at trying to prevent
what critics call partial-birth abortions while meeting the
requirements laid down by the justices on Wednesday. By William
Glaberson.

   CONGRESS-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ The Senate approved a
bipartisan bill Thursday that would require a growing number of
secretive, tax-exempt groups that raise and spend money on
political activities to reveal their donors and spending. Only six
Senate Republicans voted against the measure, and the House
endorsed the same bill on Wednesday, 385-39. President Clinton said
he will sign the measure as soon as Congress sends it to him. By

   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Undated) _ For ages, nations have dreamed of
building invulnerable shields to protect themselves from hostile
forces. There was the Great Wall, the Maginot Line and, in America,
the Safeguard antimissile system and Star Wars. All fell short.
Now, the Clinton administration and its military advisers are
trying again, this time with a limited antimissile weapon they
think will go a long way toward immunizing the United States
against attack at least from missiles launched by adversaries like
North Korea, Iran and Iraq, which are known to be in various stages
of developing intercontinental missiles. Officials at the Pentagon
and experts outside of the government say this defense technology
has reached a new level of maturity. They argue that the
combination of miniaturized electronics and high speed rockets can
produce an agile, light-weight weapon that can find and ram an
incoming bomb at supersonic speed. But critics are skeptical that
it can work. A Special Report by William J. Broad.

   MEXICO-WOMEN (Mexico City) _ The macho, conservative world of
Mexican politics has taken on a decidedly feminine appeal to win
the votes of women. Male strippers were hired to perform at one
campaign rally. Television advertisements raised questions about
candidates' relationships with their ex-wives. And political wives
and daughters have opened themselves up to as much scrutiny as the
men running for office. The main reason is simple: women make up 52
percent of the electorate and could decide the race. By Ginger
Thompson.

   IRAN-JEWS (Hamadan) _ This is where Esther, the Jewish queen of
Persia, is reputed to be buried, a town once a center of Jewish
life. Now there are 35 Jews left. Here, as elsewhere in Iran, a
once-thriving community is worried. A verdict is expected Saturday
in the spy trial of 13 Jews in the Iranian city of Shiraz and,
according to Jewish leaders, the case has made life so unsettled
that up to half of the remaining Iranian Jews will emigrate in the
next year or so. By Susan Sachs.

Texas and Washington, where it has a growing list of legislative

   CONVENTIONS-DOTCOMS (Undated) _ For a clear sign of the arrival
of e-politics, look to the skybox. This year, as always, household
names will adorn those familiar symbols of convention coverage, the
broadcast booths perched high above the floors of the Republican
and Democratic national conventions. But the old-line networks and
all-news cable channels will have new neighbors, New Media outposts
like Pseudo.com, America Online and USA Today.com that have all
been allotted the coveted booths. Down on the convention floor,
reporters for Voter.com and EVOTE will mingle with the delegates.
Around the hall, pool cameras operated by C-SPAN will send
convention images via streaming video to computer users. By Peter

JUST ANOTHER CUBAN FAMILY SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For immediate release.)  
 &HT;    
 ATTENTION EDITORS: Now that Elian Gonzalez is on his way back to
Cuba, we call your attention to the following ``separate-buy''
article from The New York Times Magazine, which recounts how the
rift in the Gonzalez family developed -- both before and after the
tragedy that landed Elian in the United States and its court
system. For purchase information, see end of text.

 &HT;    
 By TIM GOLDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Thanksgiving, three days after his ex-wife and son went
missing in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, 31, received a call from
Miami relatives with the news that his 5-year-old son Elian had
been pulled from the waters off the Florida coast by a couple of
fishermen.
 &HT;    Later, after visiting the child at a hospital near Fort
Lauderdale, Juan Miguel's Uncle Lazaro called again to tell him
that the boy's mother Elisa had perished at sea in an apparent
failed flight from Cuba, but that Elian had survived the ordeal
astonishingly well.
 &HT;    The next day, TV news crews had already turned up at the
hospital, followed by the first Cuban-American politicians offering
their support.
 &HT;    With all the attention, Juan Miguel's Aunt Caridad in Miami had
begun hoping for a second small miracle to follow Elian's rescue:
that her brother (Juan Miguel's father) and his family might
finally have a reason to leave Cuba and join the rest of the
Gonzalezes in the United States ...
 &HT;    But, the story begins in Cardenas, the home of the Gonzalez
family on Cuba's north coast ...
 &HT;    The elegant colonial town built in the 19th century sits two and
a half hours east of Havana _ and due south of the Florida Keys, in
the path of currents that have carried wave after wave of desperate
migrants to the United States.
 &HT;    When Castro and his rebels overthrew Fulgencio Batista in 1959,
Cardenas was, for the most part, remote from the centers of the
uprising. Juan Miguel Gonzalez's grandparents, Luis and Georgina,
weathered the revolution relatively well; Luis kept his job as a
stevedore at the Cardenas port. The couple's nine children _ Juan
Miguel's father, aunts and uncles _ had a tougher time, and
struggled to find any work at all.
 &HT;    Uncle Delfin, then a dock worker in his early 20s, was among
those in the family with great hopes for the revolution. ``I think
I supported them for about a month,'' he said of the Communists.
 &HT;    On March 22, 1962, Delfin was arrested and charged with
subversion. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison. His devastated
mother Georgina, took down the large framed photograph of Castro
that she had put up on the living-room wall.
 &HT;    Later, several of Juan Miguel's aunts and uncles would remember
1962 as the year they began thinking about a new life outside of
Cuba.
 &HT;    For Caridad, whose husband had divorced her and hopped a boat
for Miami, America became a dream of opportunity, freedom and
requited love. When Castro announced in September 1965 that Cubans
with relatives in the United States would be free to leave,
Caridad, then a 35-year-old seamstress, boarded one of the
so-called freedom flights and flew to Miami.
 &HT;    Back in Cuba, Aunt Haydee got a job in a school cafeteria; Uncle
Manolo trained as a mechanic and found work repairing boat motors
for a fishing cooperative; Lazaro emerged as a talented young
gymnast just as Cuba began to pour resources into its sports
program; Juan Miguel's father, Juan, took a job as a police
investigator in the interior ministry, a career choice that not all
his siblings appreciated.
 &HT;    In 1979, with Caridad's help, Delfin got a visa and came to the
United States just months before his mother's death. Another of
Juan Miguel's aunts brought her family in 1983, and Luis, the
family patriarch, followed her the next spring. Manolo and Lazaro
took their families to Costa Rica in August 1984 and applied for
American visas there.
 &HT;    In Miami's Little Havana, the Cuban culture that received them
had begun to grow more diverse with the influx of the younger, more
liberal emigres. At the same time, older anti-Castro exiles were
coming into their own as an American political force.
 &HT;    But in Cuba, the next generation of Gonzalezes grew up seeing
the country differently. None of them knew a world before Fidel. In
the late 1960s and '70s, when some of Juan Miguel's uncles were
growing bitter, when his aunts felt like outcasts for going to
church, some of their children seemed to thrive.
 &HT;    Like thousands of other young Cubans of his generation, Juan
Miguel's eldest cousin, Jose Antonio, became the first member of
his family to attend college, earning a degree from the University
of Matanzas that led him to a job with the ministry of agriculture.
 &HT;    But if Castro had chosen among the cousins for one to champion
his crusade, he could not have done better than Juan Miguel.
Following in his father's path, Juan Miguel joined the Union of
Young Communists at 15 and threw himself into the duties it
presented.
 &HT;    In September 1984, he met Elisabeth Brotons at a birthday party
and the two soon fell in love. When they married, Elisa was just
shy of 16, Juan Miguel not yet 17.
 &HT;    At first, they lived with Elisa's mother, Raquel Rodriguez. Juan
Miguel left school after 10th grade and went to work in a paper
factory, training to become an electrician. Eventually, Elisa and
Juan Miguel went to night school to earn their high school
diplomas.
 &HT;    While he completed his three years of military service with an
army firefighting unit near Cardenas, she enrolled at a vocational
school in Varadero that prepared workers for jobs in hotels and
restaurants.
 &HT;    Varadero, a long ribbon of white-sand beach 10 miles west of
Cardenas, was becoming a centerpiece of Fidel Castro's reluctant
effort to attract foreign capital after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Its hotels, many of them operated or partly owned by foreign
companies, offered some of the best-paying jobs in the country.
 &HT;    In 1990, Elisa went to work as a chambermaid at the newest
Varadero hotel. Juan Miguel also found a job in Varadero, and
eventually, he and Elisa did well enough to buy a creaky 1956 Nash
Rambler and to build a home for themselves next to his family's
house.
 &HT;    But Juan Miguel and Elisa struggled to have a child, eventually
losing seven pregnancies.
 &HT;    After several years of marriage, they started drifting apart.
Friends saw them as having less and less in common: she loved
clothes and perfume and romantic movies; he liked hanging out with
friends _ and began to go with other women.
 &HT;    Finally, in May 1991, they divorced. Then, several months later,
they were living together again. ``We had always wanted to have a
child,'' Juan Miguel said. ``We got together again to see if we
could do it. And finally we did.'' After months of bed rest and
prenatal checkups, Elisa gave birth on Dec. 6, 1993 to Elian, a
name made up from the first three letters of Elisa and the last two
of Juan.
 &HT;    But as much as Elisa cared for Juan Miguel, she was tired of his
running around. Juan Miguel, for his part, said he felt different,
too. ``She was like a sister to me,'' he said. In February 1997, 11
years after they were married and two months after Elian's third
birthday, they separated for good.
 &HT;    Still friends after the split, they shared custody of the boy
and Elisa remained close to her former in-laws.
 &HT;    Elisa's life began to turn on an evening in August 1997, when at
a Varadero nightspot with friends she met Lazaro Rafael Munero.
Within about two months, he went to live with her at Raquel's
house.
 &HT;    Elisa insisted she had found a good man. The son of an oil
worker, Munero had dropped out of school in 10th grade; at age 18,
he was imprisoned for more than a year for breaking into a hotel
room with a friend and stealing $236.55 from a German tourist. When
he met Elisa, he was 22; his steadiest job had been selling soft
drinks and beer to tourists on the beach in front of one of the
Varadero hotels. Mostly, he made his living as a taxi driver.
 &HT;    ``He would come by here sometimes to pick up the boy or drop him
off,'' Juan Miguel said of Munero. ``We got along with him all
right.''
 &HT;    Less than a year later, he left Cuba in a small boat with three
friends. Elisa's relatives say that he tried to persuade her to go
with him but that she refused.
 &HT;    Four months after his arrival in Florida, Munero bought a
motorized rubber raft to return to Cuba. He was picked up on Oct.
26, 1998 by the Cuban Coast Guard.
 &HT;    Munero spent the next two months there in prison. After his
release, he moved back in with Elisa at her mother's apartment.
Later they rented an apartment of their own and took Elian with
them.
 &HT;    Months later, they set off before dawn with friends and some of
Munero's family in a homemade boat with a balky 50-horsepower
motor.
 &HT;    Juan Miguel says that only in their first conversation after
Elian was released from the hospital did the boy ever speak about
what had happened.
 &HT;    ```Papa, my mama got lost in the sea,''' Juan Miguel remembers
his son saying. ``I told him: `Don't worry. You will be right back
here with me.''' Later that night, Juan Miguel said, his Aunt
Caridad called. ``She told me: `With all this, your life is set
here.'' Several of his other aunts and uncles called with similar
pleas.
 &HT;    ``Then Lazaro and Delfin called, and they started to offend
me,'' Juan Miguel said. ``They started telling me how bad the
government here is, all that. And me _ I have my ideals. They never
said a thing about the boy staying there _ they were just insisting
that we should go there.''
 &HT;    Two days later, the foreign ministry in Havana sent the United
States a diplomatic note seeking the boy's return.
 &HT;    Fidel Castro himself asked him how he felt about the situation
and what he wanted to do. ``He told me I could do what I pleased,''
Juan Miguel said. ``If I wanted to leave, I could leave.
Nonetheless, I told him no. My decision was clear.''
 &HT;    Castro was quick to recognize the episode's political potential:
an issue with the power to galvanize not only the party faithful
but also every Cuban parent and child and millions of people
abroad.
 &HT;    Within weeks of his rescue, Elian had become the biggest
revolutionary symbol since Che.
 &HT;    Castro's enemies were just as quick to recognize a poster child
when they saw one.
 &HT;    According to people working with the family, the cause has been
dominated by the Cuban American National Foundation, which has
sponsored most of the Gonzalezes political activities and advised
them on strategy.
 &HT;    As for Cuba, ``What is clear is that he is going to continue to
be a boy symbol, a boy hero,'' said Ricardo Chapelin, the Communist
Party chief -in Cardenas. ``This battle did not begin with Elian.
Our struggle has been one of challenging the government of the
United States for its attacks against our country. And we will
continue with this struggle, which is one that strengthens us in
every way.''
 &HT;    Elian has strengthened a lot of those who have fought over his
welfare. Fidel Castro hasn't looked so energetic in years. His
adversaries in Miami, while out of step with most Americans,
managed to seize hold of the presidential campaign, bring the U.S.
attorney general to their doorstep and reassert their once-fading
influence on Capitol Hill.
 &HT;    And Juan Miguel's uncle, Lazaro, is said to be weighing movie
and book deals of various sorts.

HOW PORTABLE DEFIBRILLATORS WORK

<P>
   The biggest selling point for the automatic external
defibrillator has been its simplicity. Portable AEDs give clear,
concise voice prompts every step of the way, removing all guesswork
to guide trained laypeople in giving lifesaving shocks.
</P>
<P>
   First, electrodes placed on the victim's chest analyze heart
rhythms to determine if a defibrillating shock is needed.
</P>
<P>
   If defibrillation is needed, the device instructs the caregiver
and others to stand clear (to avoid shocking themselves), then
instructs the caregiver to deliver the shock by pressing a green
button.
</P>
<P>
   If no shock is needed, it instructs the caregiver to recheck the
victim's pulse and begin CPR if no pulse is found.
</P>
<P>
   After one minute of CPR, the AED analyzes the heart rhythm again
to determine the next steps. &QL;

DEFIBRILLATE THE MASSES
</HEADLINE>
  Health-care professionals training people to save cardiac patients 
(For use after July 3 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ANGELA LEMIRE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you can perform basic CPR and push a button when told, you're
qualified to save the life of a co-worker, family member, customer
or even a golfing buddy in cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Once a method reserved for medical professionals, the use of
automatic external defibrillators by laypeople in private and
public workplaces is catching on. This development, touted by
experts as the most important adjunct to cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) within the past few decades, means it is more
likely the life-saving electric shocks can be administered in the
critical first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than laptop computers, programmable in most languages
and simple to use, the AED delivers a shock to the chest powerful
enough to temporarily stop some abnormal heart rhythms that cause
cardiac arrest, giving the heart a chance to return to a beat that
can pump blood again until trained medics arrive.
</P>
<P>
   El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana and Parsons Corporation in
Pasadena are two private business within Los Angeles County that
have formed their own AED response teams recently, according to the
American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at El Caballero have yet to be called to an actual
cardiac arrest emergency, but the AEDs bring general manager Tom
Bernsen some peace of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that you hope you never have to
use,'' said Bernsen during a recent training demonstration. ``The
reason we have these defibs here is to stay ahead of the action,
not behind it. We would encourage all businesses to have AEDs. You
just never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout California, employees at stadiums, malls, airports,
beaches, restaurants and everyday workplaces also are getting
trained to use AEDs, due largely to legislation passed in January
that protects trained laypeople _ non-medical professionals _ from
getting sued after using AEDs to revive cardiac arrest victims.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Los Angeles plans to pilot AED response teams at
some police stations, Los Angeles Zoo, City Hall and at least one
municipal golf course. Six Flags Magic Mountain, Disneyland, Disney
Studios, San Diego Zoo and Universal Studios already have them
available to treat visitors or employees stricken by cardiac arrest
more quickly, according to the American Red Cross of Greater Los
Angeles, which now offers AED training with CPR instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People die needlessly,'' said Gail Silverman, a cardiovascular
intensive care nurse and American Red Cross volunteer who pushes
for increased use of AEDs throughout Los Angeles. ``I defibrillate
patients almost every day. And it still gives me chills whenever I
use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudden cardiac arrest can strike anybody, anywhere, without
warning.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 250,000 people die from cardiac arrest each year,
and most attacks occur among older men on Monday and Friday
mornings _ prime work hours. For children, the low-risk group,
cardiac arrest can occur in near drownings or severe electric
shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a heart attack, in which blood flow to the heart muscle
temporarily is blocked, the primary cause of sudden cardiac arrest
is ventricular fibrillation _ a condition in which the heart's
electrical signals become disorganized and erratic.
</P>
<P>
   The heart quivers _ ``like a bag of worms,'' as one AED trainer
described it _ and cannot pump blood.
</P>
<P>
   CPR can keep a cardiac arrest victim's blood and oxygen flowing
to preserve vital organs for a short amount of time, but
defibrillation is the only way to reorganize abnormal electrical
signals into a steady heartbeat again.
</P>
<P>
   A victim's chance of survival decreases by 10 percent every
minute he or she goes without defibrillation following cardiac
arrest, according to American Red Cross statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts estimate that making AEDs as commonplace as fire
extinguishers could save 100,000 lives each year. The device costs
about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross and American Heart Association have begun
training laypeople on AEDs in tandem with CPR lessons at 14
locations within the San Fernando Valley area.
</P>
<P>
   At El Caballero's 100-acre golf course, one device travels at
all times in the course marshal's cart, while another stays with
clubhouse doctors. Fourteen managers and supervisors across every
department and shift change know how to use them. And members _
especially regulars who golf with members with heart problems _ are
invited to get AED training through the club.
</P>
<P>
   The golfing industry has good cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Golfing typically corresponds with the likeliest hours for
cardiac arrest _ between 6 and 11 a.m. _ and expansive courses can
slow paramedics' response times in reaching victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is strengthen the chain of survival,''
said Dr. William K. Averil, a cardiologist and director for
American Heart Association's western state affiliates. ``There are
four basic links in the chain, and early defibrillation is the
third (link) and has been the weakest without AEDs.''
</P>
<P>
   The other ``links'' are early intervention such as a call to
911, early CPR, and advanced care by a medical professional who can
perform other analysis and more complicated lifesaving procedures.
</P>
<P>
   National survival rates for cardiac arrest are less than 5
percent, but experts predict that widespread AED distribution will
increase survival rates to 20 percent or more, said Averil.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannine Baugh, a Panorama City resident and tax accountant for
a private company, recently became an AED trainer for American Red
Cross because she believes more laypeople should get involved in
emergency response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life you save could be my own,'' said Baugh, a diabetic
who has seen cardiac arrest claim the lives of two co-workers in
her career. She recalled, ``All the people knew how to do was call
911.''
</P>
<P>
   More complicated AED technology has been around for decades in
hospitals and ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   But about three years ago, simplified technology emerged to
create today's portable AEDs. Few professionals besides police,
firefighters, lifeguards and airline attendants used them until
recently, largely for fear of liability. Nationwide interest in AED
training rose within the last year, as states including California
passed laws extending ``Good Samaritan'' protection to laypeople.
</P>
<P>
   Both American Red Cross and American Heart Association officials
work closely with laypeople to determine how many AEDs are needed
in public and private workplaces, and how many employees, at a
minimum, should be trained to use them. They consider the layout
and expanse of each facility, number of levels, number of employees
and regular visitors, and the nature of the business. For example,
electric companies or concert venues would require more AEDs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare International Airport in Chicago often is cited as the
national model for AED effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The airport placed the devices a 90-second walk apart throughout
the airport six months ago, rigged them to alarms that
automatically dispatch emergency medics to that location and
trained 50,000 employees to use AEDs.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week alone, AEDs saved three lives at O'Hare. And
to date, nine of 11 people who suffered cardiac arrest at the
airport have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Hughes, who coordinates vocational services at an overnight
facility for troubled teens in North Hollywood and trains staff in
CPR, also took a recent American Red Cross class in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to train staff and place AEDs at the facility's
three group homes and school, where high-pressure job situations
have prompted cardiac arrests among faculty in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should have one of these in their office,'' said
Hughes, noting coaches and athletic trainers as prime examples.
``You have a lot of people hesitant about helping people in
emergencies, but this machine is self-explanatory. They're afraid
of doing something wrong. But this gives you confidence to help.'' &QL;

&HT;     ABORTION IS SAFE, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Make no mistake about it. The Supreme Court's 5-4
decision reaffirming a woman's basic right to choose an abortion
was a squeaker that alarms both those who are pro-choice and those
who care more about a fetus than a pregnant female.
</P>
<P>
   The high court decided correctly that it was essential to
protect the constitutional guarantee of individual liberty against
a ban on a late-term procedure under vague, sweeping laws that had
become an excuse for abolishing other abortions as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska law at issue was so loosely worded that it could
encompass second-trimester abortions more commonly used than the
rare so-called ``partial birth'' procedure technically targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the law provided no exception _ from criminal
penalties that carried up to 20 years in prison _ to protect the
health and life of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   The enraged reaction of the court's minority made it perfectly
clear that this case was about chipping away at the basic right to
choose an abortion, not just about the brutal quality of the
rarely-used procedure in question.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four justices in the minority disgraced their black
robes by abandoning all pretence of judicial dignity, hurling
insults at the majority and resorting to hysterical accusations
grounded in emotion rather than law. They threw a collective hissy
fit more appropriate for a political rally than the high bench.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wildly accused the majority of
practically condoning infanticide. ``It is a value judgment,'' he
thundered, pressing his own fetus-obsession as the only value that
matters in a society of diverse and sometimes conflicting values.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas complained about court-mandated
``abortion on demand,'' a crude pejorative that anti-abortion
activists prefer instead of the more civilized ``request.'' Thomas
also protested the majority's ``philosophical views'' without
admitting his own ideological bent.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy groused that the decision failed to
outlaw a procedure that ``many decent and civilized people find so
abhorrent as to be among the most serious of crimes against human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined two dissenters but did
not pour further fuel on the fire by adding a separate intemperate
opinion. He must preside over this divided court, and a little
restraint was probably wise on his part.
</P>
<P>
   None of the dissenters acknowledged that millions of Americans
do not believe as they do that life begins at conception, which
would make abortion at any time the killing of a child. A Supreme
Court majority did not buy that theological theory in its original
1973 decision legalizing limited abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters also barely nodded in the direction of the woman
involved, embracing Nebraska's transparent argument that an
exception to protect a woman's life or health is not ``necessary''
because unspecified alternative procedures might be available. If
they were troubled by any health problems a woman might suffer from
bearing an unwanted child, they did not indicate it.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters are determined to force their own ideological
views on the whole country under cover of judicial power, even
though they are jeopardizing the credibility and authority of the
court they serve by turning it into an advocate for one religious
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority,
kept the tone of his opinion rational and noted carefully that on
this subject there are ``virtually irreconcilable points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer and the majority pointed out that ``millions fear that a
law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to
lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and
leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions
with the attendant risks of death and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer continued, ``Constitutional law must govern a society
whose different members sincerely hold directly opposing views.''
Right on.
</P>
<P>
   But the narrow one-vote margin by which sanity prevailed means
that the next Supreme Court appointments are likely to be crucial
for the future of female independence.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush predictably criticized the ruling, and
Vice President Al Gore predictably praised it. Gore has promised to
name pro-choice jurists to the high court and although Bush does
not admit it, everyone believes that he would name anti-abortion
folks like Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices are getting along in years and could retire in
the next four years. The philosophical makeup of the court could
flip with just one new justice, depending on circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the abortion issue may now be galvanized into
renewed political action, although so far most voters do not seem
to grasp the significance of the pending court appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate consequences will be to throw the problem back to
the states. If they sincerely wish to abolish only the ``partial
birth'' procedure, they can draft laws that specifically target
only that one while leaving a loophole to guard the health and life
of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Siding with the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said such
a narrow law would meet her own constitutional standard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some abortion foes responded by saying that they could not
go for such a narrow statute. No doubt they feel it would be too

SUPREME COURT TO SETTLE DISPUTE BETWEEN NEW HAMPSHIRE, MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Maine, Colo., N.J., Neb., Ill., Wis., Iowa)   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a final day of housekeeping after concluding its
term, the Supreme Court Thursday agreed to settle a longstanding
and increasingly bitter boundary dispute between New Hampshire and
Maine about which state includes the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   The federal installation sits on islands in the Piscataqua
River, which flows into Portsmouth Harbor and forms the state
boundary between Portsmouth, N.H., and Kittery, Maine. According to
Maine, the state boundary is in the middle of the channel, placing
the shipyard on the Maine side. Consequently, Maine has been
imposing its income tax on the people who work at the shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   But New Hampshire, asserting a historical claim to all the river
up to the shoreline on the Maine side, says the shipyard is in New
Hampshire, which has no income tax.
</P>
<P>
   The United States owns the property in dispute, having begun in
1800 to acquire the five islands that make up the shipyard. For
years, however, the Navy regarded the island as within New
Hampshire's political jurisdiction. More recently, it has moved to
an official position of neutrality, though the federal government
has been withholding Maine income tax from the workers' paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   In March, New Hampshire filed its case against Maine directly in
the Supreme Court, invoking the court's constitutional ``original''
jurisdiction to hear suits between states. In agreeing Thursday to
take jurisdiction of the case, the justices instructed the federal
government to file a brief and make its views known.
</P>
<P>
   The case, New Hampshire vs. Maine, No. 130 Original, is
reminiscent of the ``original'' case the court heard two years ago
between New York and New Jersey about which could claim Ellis
Island. New Jersey emerged the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The competing claims of New Hampshire and Maine date to the
colonial period. New Hampshire says it is significant that the Port
of Piscataqua, now Portsmouth Harbor, was excluded from the
Massachusetts Bay colony in 1691. What is now Maine was originally
part of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Maine cites a decree signed in 1740 by King George
II, setting the boundary as a line that ``shall pass up thro' the
mouth of Piscataqua Harbour and up the Middle of the River.''
</P>
<P>
   In its brief asking the court to hear its case, New Hampshire
said that the shipyard ``has always been culturally, economically
and politically connected to New Hampshire.'' The state ``is not
able to maintain its historic connections to the shipyard without
judicial assistance,'' New Hampshire said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are likely to appoint a special master to hear
evidence in the case and make a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   As the court began its summer recess, it took these other
actions Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   Drug Sentencing
</P>
<P>
   The court vacated a Denver man's 30-year sentence for
distributing cocaine, and instructed the federal appeals court
there to reconsider the sentence in light of the Supreme Court
ruling this week that the sentencing provision of New Jersey's hate
crime law was unconstitutional. The court's action Thursday in
Jones vs. United States, No. 99-8176, could portend a major
upheaval in federal drug sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Monday in the New Jersey case, Apprendi vs. New
Jersey, the court held that any fact that increases the penalty for
a crime beyond the statutory maximum had to be found by the jury
beyond a reasonable doubt. The New Jersey law was unconstitutional
because the judge, not the jury, determined after the defendant's
conviction whether the crime had been motivated by bias, a finding
that under the hate crime law then resulted in an increased
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The drug sentence the court vacated Thursday in light of that
ruling was typical of the way drug sentencing works in the federal
system. Carless Jones was indicted on and convicted by a jury of
two counts of distributing cocaine, a crime that carries a
statutory penalty of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment did not specify a particular amount of cocaine,
and the jury made no finding on that question. The pre-sentence
report informed the judge that the quantity of the drug, 165.5
grams, was enough for a life sentence. Over the defendant's
objection, the judge imposed a sentence of 30 years on each count,
to run concurrently. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
the sentence, ruling that the jury had found all the necessary
elements of the offense, and that the judge could make the findings
necessary to determine the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion
</P>
<P>
   Following its invalidation on Wednesday of a Nebraska abortion
law, the court vacated rulings by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Chicago that upheld similar laws in Illinois (Hope
Clinic vs. Ryan, No. 99-1152) and Wisconsin (Planned Parenthood vs.
Doyle, No. 99-1156). The court also turned down an appeal by Iowa
from a ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
struck down that state's so-called partial-birth abortion law last
year at the same time it invalidated the Nebraska law (Miller vs.
Planned Parenthood, No. 99-1112).

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, aware he might have to
forge relations with a new ruling party in Mexico, is working hard
to stay out of Sunday's presidential election there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If elected, I look forward to working with whomever the good
people of Mexico choose to serve them as president,'' Bush said
Thursday, five weeks from receiving the GOP presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also offered a carefully crafted comment about Mexico's
reputation as something less than a full-fledged democracy, a
reputation built in part on the fact that one party has been in
control since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe a free and fair presidential election in Mexico will
be an affirmation of Mexico's continuing political progress,'' he
said of the nation that his given him his largest dose of foreign
policy experience.
</P>
<P>
   For some, one solid measure of that progress will be if the
National Action Party (PAN), headed by presidential nominee Vicente
Fox, can end the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 71-year hold
on control of the national government.
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show a tight race between Fox and PRI nominee
Francisco Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1995, Bush has met with Fox and
Labastida. But like most American politicians, Bush's links to
Mexico are skewed heavily toward PRI officials, including current
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall any meetings that the governor had with folks
outside of the PRI,'' said former Texas Secretary of State Al
Gonzales, now a state Supreme Court justice. ``Most of our meetings
dealt with substantive issues ongoing between Mexico and Texas that
required us to meet with PRI officials .'' Bush has met with PAN
members who are governors of Mexican states. That included a March
1996 session with Fox, then the governor of Guanajuato. Former
Secretary of State Tony Garza, now a state railroad commissioner,
and former U.S. Ambassador Jim Jones, who also was at the meeting,
on Thursday could not recall details about it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush met with Labastida, then Mexico's interior secretary, in
May 1998 in Mexico City. Gonzales said the major topic was American
business officials' concern about the safety of their employees in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida said the problem would be addressed, according to
Gonzales, who said Bush was pleased with the plan that came out of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the deeper links to PRI officials, Gonzales believes
Bush can quickly make ties to PAN officials, if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I don't believe he has the same kind of
relationship,'' Gonzales said of Bush and PAN officials.
``Relationships take time to develop. I have every confidence in
the world that would develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Ambassador Jones agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Governor Bush and other political leaders in the
United States with whom Mexico has a feeling of simpatico will be
very valuable because Governor Fox, if he wins, will need as much
advice on how to form a government at a national level, and I think
people who had those experiences will be very valuable to him,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also believes there are no inherent obstacles to forging
ties with PAN leaders if Fox prevails Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the U.S. point of view, we should really not care because
the amount of difference among the candidates concerning
fundamental U.S.-Mexico issues is minuscule,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Garces, who has helped coordinate Texas relations with
Mexico under three governors, also sees a smooth transition _
regardless of who is president of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``You handle it the same way you would handle everything when
there is a change of government in a different nation,'' said
Garces, Mexico and border affairs liaison in the secretary of
state's office. ``You accept whoever is elected as being the will
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Garces believes Bush's hands-off approach to the Sunday election
is the only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Mexico and meeting with people from other parties
would be sending a political signal, and we try to stay out of
being political,'' Garces said. ``You just don't want to interfere
with the political process in another country.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, after he clinched the presidential nomination, Bush
ruled out a pre-election trip to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a complicating factor there,'' he said. ``The Mexican
presidential election is taking place, and I certainly don't want
to get involved in that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who will continue to have ties to Mexico whether he is
president or governor, forging links with a new ruling party will
not be a major obstacle, according to Secretary of State Elton
Bomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with Mexico, it's all about personal relationships
more than anything else,'' he said.

 &HT;    LAUGHTER A GOOD MEDICINE _ FOR ARTHRITIS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 2
 &HT;    Duplication alert: Moving in (l)Lifestyle and (w)Washington
categories

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Becky Callicoatte loves Lucy _ and with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Callicoatte accidentally discovered several years ago that a
good laugh immediately eased the enduring pain of her rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has used tapes of re-runs of ``I Love Lucy,''
``The Odd Couple,'' ``Candid Camera'' and other television comedy
shows, as well as a joke wherever she can pick one up, for pain
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Callicoatte, of Shreveport, La., is one of nine arthritis
sufferers who have been trained as ``patient-partners'' in a new
program created by the Arthritis Foundation and G.D. Searle &AMP; Co.,
the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, to teach other persons with the
condition how to use ``cognitive pain management'' to help break
the self-reinforcing cycle of chronic pain.
</P>
<P>
   She also appears with five other arthritis sufferers on a
45-minute video around which the teaching sessions are organized.
``Odd Couple'' star Tony Randall _ who also has arthritis _ leads a
video discussion by Callicoatte and others on techniques they have
used to control their pain.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, she recalled a pivotal event in her
30-year battle with rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was of those days when the pain was just terrible,'' she
said, ``and finally, I was so desperate that I said to my husband,
'Why don't you just go ahead and put me in a nursing home.'''
</P>
<P>
   He immediately replied, ``I would if I could afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew he was joking and the remark struck her as funny at the
time. She noticed immediately that the pain eased with her
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, I started watching old television comedies and a
friend of mine in Houston would mail me cartoons out of the
newspaper to make me laugh,'' Callicoatte said. ``Anything to just
take my mind off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. William Fry, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at
Stanford University Medical School and a pioneer researcher in the
physiology of humor and laughter, says Callicoatte may have been
doing a lot more than taking her mind off of her pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the pain you experience with arthritis has to do with
muscle spasm,'' Fry said. ``In response to pain in the connective
tissue _ in ligaments, cartilage and so forth _ surrounding muscles
try to pull away from that pain, to get away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   This secondary level of pain is overlaid onto the initial
arthritis pain, Fry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughter is a spasmodic process,'' he said. ``Muscles are
contracting, relaxing, contracting, relaxing and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   This tends to override other muscle spasms, Fry believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are laughing, muscles that are not involved in the
laughter activity usually go into a more flaccid state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Always looking for a joke, Callicoatte said Fry's opinion ``must
mean I'm not crazy, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Searle-Arthritis Foundation program, entitled ``Taking
Control of Arthritis Pain,'' is straightforward. There's nothing
magic about the techniques being offered and participants are
cautioned that the program is not intended to supplant their
medical care.
</P>
<P>
   However, they are told that pain often occurs in a cycle. People
who hurt lose abilities and become depressed and stressed, which
leads to more pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although pain is a physical symptom, you can actually use the
power of your mind to help manage it,'' a workbook used during the
``Taking Control'' sessions states. Then it lists techniques such
as distraction, controlled muscle relaxation and guided imagery in
which the patient concentrates on positive memories or pleasant
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Other techniques for pain management include exercise and
hot/cold treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``patient-partners,'' a Searle program, the
sessions are to be led by Arthritis Foundation ``heroes overcoming
arthritis,'' persons who have been recognized for their own efforts
to cope with pain.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Whetstone Mescher, vice president of the Arthritis
Foundation, said the program will be offered to organizations and
corporations whose members or employees may have arthritis.

BOND PRICES RISE IN A SIGH OF RELIEF, FOR NOW, ON INTEREST RATES

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond yields fell sharply Thursday amid weakness in
stocks and investor relief that the Federal Reserve left interest
rates unchanged on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the currency market, the dollar was off against the euro and
the yen, making dollar-denominated investments, like Treasury
securities, more attractive to foreign investors because of
exchange rate advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 10-year Treasury note, which many market
participants are using as the benchmark, rose 16/32, to 10 14/32.
Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price,
fell to 6.02 percent from 6.10 percent. The price of the 30-year
bond rose 1 5/32, to 105 10/32. Its yield dropped to 5.87 percent
from 5.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, director of the fixed-income department at J.W.
Genesis Financial Corp., said the moves had been exaggerated by low
liquidity and volume in the market.
</P>
<P>
   He said Treasury prices were too lofty, with the price of a
10-year note having run up too fast, and more interest rate
increases by the Fed were in the offing. ``I don't see prices
remaining at these high levels,'' he said. ``Prices in bonds and
equities will decline. The economic slowdown is a head fake, so
there are more tightenings in the wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said the Federal Open Market Committee, at its meeting on
Wednesday, refrained from tightening again ``as more moderate
economic and inflation data suggested that the previous tightenings
instituted over the past year may finally be starting to lower the
trend rate of economic growth to a more sustainable level, while at
the same time keeping a lid on rising price pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the issues of sustainability and extent of any slowdown
are open questions at this juncture,'' he added, ``and further Fed
tightening at the August FOMC meeting seems probable in light of
the economy's still-buoyant forward momentum, tight labor markets
and continued upcreep in inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government securities market was bolstered by the Treasury's
buyback program, some end-of-the-quarter buying and softer new-home
sales data that ran counter to sales figures released earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The release Thursday of updated figures for first-quarter gross
domestic product caused few surprises. Some bond market
participants think that coming figures on consumer prices could
prove unnerving, particularly if components of the price index
outside of energy go up more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Fine is among those paying closer heed to other coming reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market's next major hurdle,'' Fine said, ``will be
the June labor market report, which should correct any misleading
perceptions resulting from last month's presumably questionable
information, which showed extraordinary weakness in the midst of a
very tight labor market.''

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Feds Say Plum Pox Money on the Way &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Melissa Vogt &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (June 29) -- Up to $13.2 million in federal money is
on its way to Pennsylvania fruit farmers hit by the plum pox virus,
Vice President Al Gore and Department of Agriculture officials
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. William Goodling, R-Seven Valleys, whose district includes
many of the counties affected by the virus, says the cash will be
nice, but late. Department of Agriculture officials identified the
virus officially in October. Goodling said he believed Gore was
using Thursday's announcement for political advancement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice-president's taking credit for releasing this funding
represents the height of political arrogance,'' Goodling said. ``It
was his administration's Office of Management and Budget that
prevented Secretary Glickman -- who is to be commended for issuing
an emergency declaration -- from honoring my request for plum pox
compensation all these months.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling backed by a handful of Pennsylvania lawmakers convinced
Congress to release $5.1 million in aid to fruit farmers in May.
Those funds were lumped into the sum announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture has also spent $3.1
million to compensate farmers who have been forced to rip up and
burn their orchards. Officials have promised fruit farmers up to
$1,000 per affected acre.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore said in a statement, ``These growers
deserve support because they have helped to shield the rest of the
industry from this devastating disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States stone fruit industry is estimated to be worth
$1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   USDA spokeswoman Susan McAvoy said the virus has been found in
600 acres of Pennsylvania orchards. More than 1,000 acres are still
quarantined.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, known as sharka, affects stone fruits, such as
peaches, apricots, plums, nectarines, apricots and almonds. The
disease can be transmitted through by aphids and grafting. While
infected trees do not die, their fruit may drop prematurely, be
deformed or covered with spots and rings. The virus does not affect
people, but it does leave the fruit unmarketable.
</P>
<P>
   Sharka was found in European orchards as early as 1910 in
Macedonia. Orchards in Turkey, Syria, India and Chile throughout
the last century have also suffered from it. The United States
seemed to have remained immune until it was discovered last year in
Adams County, Penn.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Agriculture, the virus appears to
be contained to west-central Pennsylvania. The department has spent
about $3.6 million for surveys and research to determine to the
extent of the virus' spread.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state agency officials continued to take leaf
samples from Adams, Cumberland and York county orchards this week.
They tested commercial orchards in Adams, Cumberland, Erie,
Lancaster and York counties last week.
</P>
<P>
   The optimal time to sample trees for the virus will end with the
onslaught of the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   Of samples processed at the state Department of Agriculture's
laboratory last week, six tested positive for plum pox. All the
positive samples came from quarantined areas in Adams and
Cumberland counties.

U.N. REPORTS WIDESPREAD DEPRIVATION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Africans south of the Sahara, an area convulsed
in wars and weakened by natural disasters, also suffer the broadest
range of social and economic disadvantages, the United Nations
says.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, the Human Development Report, examines the
availability of schools, clean water and medical care, and whether
people can play a political role. It began 10 years ago as an
experiment to measure a nation's growth not by economic figures but
by statistical profiles of its people and what they could expect
from life.
</P>
<P>
   This year the report found that 30 of the 35 countries at the
bottom of the index were in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In that region, where the spread of AIDS and other diseases has
begun to shorten life spans after decades of slow improvement,
people can no longer expect to live beyond their 40s or 50s. Fewer
than half go to school and less than half _ sometimes 25 percent or
fewer _ can read, the survey shows. It also shows a large
proportion of people _ as high as 66 percent in the case of Sierra
Leone _ without access to clean water, and even larger majorities
lacking basic sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Sierra Leone, which is ranked last, the other most
disadvantaged nations, in rising order, are Niger, Burkina Faso,
Ethiopia, Burundi, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Chad, the Central
African Republic and Mali.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, the countries with the highest human
development indicators are, from the top, Canada, Norway, the
United States, Australia, Iceland, Sweden, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Japan and Britain. In the Western Hemisphere, only
Haiti ranks in the bottom 35 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the report, produced by the U.N. Development
Program, focuses on new themes that experts say should be factored
into studying why some countries remain poor and others grow in
economic and human terms. This year the report tried to connect the
importance of human rights and political freedoms with economic and
social conditions, saying the two could no longer be separated. It
challenges the view of some political leaders that people are not
``ready'' for democracy until there has been economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights are not, as has sometimes been argued, a reward
of development,'' said Mark Malloch Brown, the development
program's administrator, in an introduction to the report.
``Rather, they are critical to achieving it. Only with political
freedoms _ the right for all men and women to participate equally
in society _ can people genuinely take advantage of economic
freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   In another departure, this year's report calls for the increased
collection and more effective use of statistics to aid in promoting
human rights by quantifying more effectively the conditions under
which many people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistical indicators are a powerful tool in the struggle for
human rights,'' the report says. Among other benefits even the
simple collection of information can provide is help in monitoring
the actions of government and curbing corruption, it adds.

IMF IS EXPECTED TO EASE DEMANDS ON DEBTOR NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The International Monetary Fund, which has ordered
developing nations to enact wrenching reforms as the price for
emergency aid in recent years, is likely to curtail the demands it
makes of clients who borrow money in the future, a senior fund
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Streamlining the conditions the IMF imposes on borrowers is one
of the changes Horst Koehler, the fund's new managing director, is
weighing as a panel he commissioned to study the role of the agency
completes a draft report. Some government officials, academic
experts, and private charity groups criticized the fund for
requiring that Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia overhaul their
economies during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's demands for broad changes were captured in a widely
reprinted 1997 photograph of Michel Camdessus, the fund's recently
retired managing director, peering over the shoulder of former
President Suharto of Indonesia as Suharto signed a lengthy letter
of intent to receive emergency aid. The fund required Indonesia to
overhaul its transportation and energy sectors and end price
subsidies on some commodities, changes that fund officials now say
might have been too much for Indonesia to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, who visited Indonesia during a tour of Asia earlier
this month, has said that he wants the fund to focus on what he
calls its ``core competencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior official said Thursday that the fund's main goal
during a crisis should be to restore investor confidence quickly by
helping troubled nations manage their finances and currencies.
Dictating more sweeping economic changes as the price for
assistance potentially works against that goal, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say that the fund has acted like a Trojan horse to
impose the economic system of the West,'' the senior official said.
``There may be more of a possibility for countries to find their
own path.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, a German who took over as IMF managing director in May,
served previously as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and, before that, as a senior economic aide to
Helmut Kohl when he was the German chancellor. He has said that one
of his top priorities is to sort through several conflicting
proposals for overhauling the IMF, including a plan put forward by
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and another by a congressional
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Summers suggested that the IMF should limit its long-term
lending programs and discourage repeat borrowing by developing
nations, the better to preserve its capital to fight financial
crises. The congressional commission advocated a much more radical
overhaul, which was dismissed by both the fund and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said Thursday that he
believed the IMF overhaul process was headed in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration strongly supported the fund's role
during the Asian crisis, though Summers has subsequently said that
some of the fund's initial demands on crisis-stricken nations were
too severe. Administration officials Thursday declined to comment
on the fund's plan to streamline the requirements it imposes on
developing nations during times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF board plans a retreat in mid-July to discuss changes,
the senior IMF official said. The fund has also arranged a retreat
with the World Bank, its sister lending agency, where officials
will try to sort out things the two bodies should do together and
others that they should do separately.
</P>
<P>
   Many broad economic changes that the fund has required its
client nations to carry out in recent years have in fact been
designed by the World Bank, IMF officials said. Fund officials now
feel their lending programs should not be used as leverage to
advance sometimes hotly disputed World Bank ideas, especially those
involving the sale of state-owned companies.

FOR MIAMI CUBANS, HIGH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL COSTS OF ELIAN AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBA-LOBBY, CUBA-U.S.) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ She was 19 when she came here from Colombia 43 years
ago, but even working with a mop in her hand, Maria Hernandez
believed she had found paradise. Then Elian Gonzalez came, and in
the seven months of speeches, marches and conflict that followed,
her Miami changed.
</P>
<P>
   She was driving to work recently when a pickup flying American
flags pulled up beside her. ``I looked over, in that way people
glance over at each other at stoplights,'' said Hernandez, who now
owns a cleaning service.
</P>
<P>
   The man in the truck rolled down a window and made an obscene
gesture at her, because he thought she was Cuban-American, she
believes. She was not flying the American flag upside-down, the way
angry Cuban-Americans had, in protest. She was just going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked at me with these mean eyes,'' she said, and she knew
her paradise was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Eckerd's to buy some things, and two cashiers were
fighting about Elian right in front of their customers,'' said
Hernandez, who is married to a Cuban-American and wanted Elian to
stay here.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost has been high. ``This is not the city I grew to
love. I have neighbors who do not speak to each other. People's
personalities have completely changed. I never knew there was so
much hate in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian _ the battle to keep him, the armed federal raid that took
him from Miami, and the courtroom decisions that sent him home to
Cuba _ widened racial and ethnic divisions that are part of Miami's
history.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps the saddest legacy of Elian, say experts on Cuban
exile history, immigration, international politics, but it is
hardly the only one.
</P>
<P>
   The fight to keep Elian in the United States became an
all-or-nothing battle for many Cuban-Americans, the dominant
culture in Miami, and it has cost them prestige and power. It has
changed the way that others around the country see them and their
cause, say experts on the community, and may even lead to an
improvement in U.S. relations with Cuban president Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not handled intelligently,'' said Lisandro Perez,
director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International
University. ``It was driven by emotions and passions, and you don't
act intelligently when you are driven by emotions and passions.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the exiles said the fight was necessary, and
moral. And while it may have colored the way people view the
exiles, it drew younger people to an old cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has united the exile community,'' said Jose Basulto, the
president of Brothers to the Rescue, a group of Cuban-American
pilots who search the Florida Straits for rafters.
</P>
<P>
   As for its cost: ``I could care less what the American people
think about the Cuban exile community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it does matter, said political experts.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's saga ``has weakened the Cuban-American position'' in
many ways, said Perez. ``The anti-embargo position has been
strengthened and it's not because Americans suddenly realized Fidel
Castro is a good guy. It's because the Elian case has made
Cuban-Americans lose a lot of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   As most of the nation seemed to believe that a 6-year-old boy
should be with his father, and the courts said that he should, too,
Cuban-Americans could not see beyond their hatred of Castro, say
political and immigration experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This became a bizarre experience where family, flag and police
_ all parts of the Republican trinity _ were attacked by
Cuban-Americans,'' said David Abraham, a professor of immigration
law at the University of Miami. ``There was the firing of the
police chief because he kept public order, and the desecration of
the flag, and it was very disconcerting to middle Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, it has ruined friendships and brought a strained
politeness to relationships.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Ann-Sofi Truby and a Cuban-American who does
maintenance at her house in South Miami had talked, ``about our
families, different things,'' said Truby, who has lived here nearly
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   They stopped talking during the Elian crisis. ``I would stay
inside while he was here,'' she said, because talk would end in
argument.
</P>
<P>
   During the demonstrations, Truby, who is in her 60s, bought an
American flag. She waved it from her Volvo whenever she saw
pro-Elian protesters. ``I would tell my grandson to roll down the
window and I would show them a `bird.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are no apologies being offered on either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us should feel extremely satisfied,'' said Ninoska
Perez, a spokeswoman for the Cuban American National Foundation, by
far the most powerful of the exile groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro had to wait until the judicial process came to an end''
to claim Elian, she said. ``For someone who has not respected any
laws during the last 41 years, that should be a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Cuban-American power structure conducted itself
left many in Miami feeling alienated.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County and Mayor Joe Carollo of
Miami made it clear that they sided with the exiles against the
federal government, drawing a backlash from around the country.
Then, Carollo fired his city manager and forced the resignation of
his police chief _ both Anglos _ and both vacancies were filled by
Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban exiles have shown such arrogance,'' said Garth
Reeves, the publisher emeritus of the city's black newspaper, The
Miami Times. ``They're saying, `This is our town now, and dammit,
we run it. We make the decisions''' to the exclusion of everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   To Reeves, and to many black Miamians, the Cuban-Americans are a
pampered minority that became a pampered majority, and now _ at the
first major setback for them in recent history _ they denigrate the
country that gave them a haven.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush, who has enjoyed the support of Miami's Cuban
exiles, who vote mostly Republican, blamed the media for what he
called a misunderstanding of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's damaged _ incorrectly so _ the nature of
Cuban-Americans in Miami,'' said Bush. ``It breaks my heart to see
the national press depict people who have been lovers of freedom
the way that this has all played out.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush defended his constituency in Tallahassee, Miami's
Cuban exiles continued to vent their anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am never going to vote again,'' said Magaly Lima, 58, who
came to Miami 38 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cuban-Americans said that what happened with Elian is what
has always happened here, that the hard-liners who control the
city's politics painted all Cuban-Americans as closed-minded.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term impact may be economic. Social instability, said
economics experts, seldom leads to a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These recent events have made Miami less attractive,'' said
Michael Connolly, chairman of the Economics Department at the
University of Miami School of Business. ``People are moving away if
they live here and aren't coming down here if they don't.''

 &HT;    Plaintiffs' attorneys divided in Coke case
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One group of plaintiffs' attorneys in the Coca-Cola
discrimination case is accusing another of illegal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who is right, the issue highlights a serious
division that has festered on the plaintiffs' side of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the class of 2,000 current and former Coke
employees alleged Thursday that prominent attorney Willie Gary is
soliciting fee agreements from class members in violation of a
local federal court rule.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and his Stuart, Fla., law firm do not represent the class,
but they do represent at least eight individual members of the
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gary firm is soliciting fee contracts that require class
members to fork over 25 percent of their settlement shares for
nothing,'' said the motion, which seeks to stop Gary's firm from
continuing the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, filed by the legal team headed by Cyrus Mehri, also
asks U.S. District Judge Richard Story to invalidate any agreements
that already have been reached between Gary's firm and individual
class members.
</P>
<P>
   But Gary's firm said it has not done anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not solicit. We were asked to come and talk to
people,'' said F. Shields McManus, one of the attorneys in Gary's
office.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, McManus said, his firm is not trying to take any
money received by a class member as a result of work performed by
Mehri's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not true,'' he said. ``Our contract has nothing to do
with what Cyrus Mehri is doing. It only has to do with individual
actions we file or with actions where our clients are the
representative of the class. We do not have a contract for fees for
this class action.''
</P>
<P>
   McManus said Gary's firm will file a formal response to the
allegations next week.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes only two weeks after Mehri's team reached an
agreement in principle with Coca-Cola to settle the class-action
suit, which alleged that the company has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's firm did not participate in the settlement talks.
Instead, he and noted attorney Johnnie Cochran represent four of
the eight plaintiffs in the case. Those four plaintiffs hired
Gary's firm in April, about a year after the class-action suit was
filed.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Cochran also represent at least four class members who
recently filed a separate lawsuit against Coke, alleging that the
company created a hostile and discriminatory work environment.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gary entered the picture, Mehri's team represented all of
the plaintiffs, as well as all of the class members.
</P>
<P>
   Mehri's team is now alleging that Gary has a ``glaring conflict
of interest'' that prevents him from representing the class. The
alleged conflict centers around Gary's majority ownership of Major
Broadcasting Cable, an Atlanta-based network focusing on
African-American family entertainment. The cable network recently
signed a multiyear advertising agreement with Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no doubt that Mr. Gary's business dealings with
Coca-Cola constitute a conflict of interest in any action he
purports to prosecute against the company,'' Mehri's team contended
in its motion.
</P>
<P>
   But McManus said Gary's firm disclosed the advertising deal to
its prospective clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an apparent conflict, and that's why we
disclosed it,'' McManus said. ``We don't think it's a real
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In the motion, Mehri's team accused Gary's firm of actually
helping Coca-Cola by soliciting individual class members. That is
allegedly because Coke stands a better chance of defeating
individual claims than one involving an entire class of employees,
the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, the desire to pick off employees' claims one-by-one is
the reason employers oppose class certification,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, McManus disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their opinion,'' he said. ``Coke apparently wants this
settlement. If they want it, why would individual suits benefit
Coke?''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch said the company had no comment.

ITS CAUSE HURT BY ELIAN AFFAIR, CUBAN-AMERICAN LOBBY TRIES TO
ADJUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBA-U.S., CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI) 
 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After dominating the U.S. policy debate over Cuba
for nearly two decades, Cuban-American advocates of a hardline
stance toward Havana find themselves on the defensive, increasingly
estranged from other Americans, according to supporters and
critics.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Cuban American National Foundation, the
preeminent exile lobby, is reorganizing its leadership to include
younger faces and Thursday appointed a non-Cuban former State
Department expert on Cuba to head its Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami-based group is also targeting the districts of
congressional adversaries for television ads and pledging to spend
``whatever it takes'' to protect the unyielding U.S. policy it
helped to craft.
</P>
<P>
   With the return home this week of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old
Cuban refugee, and an agreement in Congress to lift the ban on
sales of food and medicine to the island, Cuban exiles are
adjusting to a political landscape that increasingly favors
accommodation with President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The travails of the foundation, widely viewed as one of the most
effective ethnic lobbies in America, are emblematic of exiles' lost
political ground. The lobby's leaders this week portrayed their
remarkably prosperous community as an underdog, locked in a bitter,
moral struggle against Goliath: American farmers and corporations
bent on doing business with Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have no choice but to respond in a very aggressive
way,'' said Jose Cardenas, the foundation's Washington director.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Garcia, the foundation's executive director, complained that
the Cuban lobby and its supporters have been bruised at the hands
of ``very good players'' in the public relations arena: Attorney
General Janet Reno, President Clinton and Castro himself.
</P>
<P>
   For some Cuba-watchers, such shifts mark a stark reversal from
the foundation's heyday under the iron-fisted stewardship of Jorge
Mas Canosa, a multimillionaire businessman who breezed through the
halls of Washington with the aura and the entourage of a head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   Under Mas Canosa's leadership, the well-financed lobby mustered
a stable of loyal congressional allies, drafted Cuba legislation,
established anti-Castro radio and television stations with federal
funds and kept U.S.-Cuban relations in a deep freeze despite the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But since Mas Canosa's death in 1997, the exile community has
yet to put forth a national figure who commands both respect and
fear in Washington. Without such leadership, the foundation has
invited challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Mas Canosa's son, who is also named
Jorge, the foundation ran into a public relations fiasco with the
Elian Gonzalez case. To an extent, it was self-inflicted. Within
hours of the boy's rescue from Florida waters last Thanksgiving,
the lobby was the first to convert Elian, literally, into a poster
child, distributing thousands of leaflets of him at the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle beneath the headline: ``Another
child victim of Fidel Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro quickly responded, portraying Elian as a kidnap victim,
being kept from a devoted father by an exile band of political
extremists. Americans who had paid little attention to the Cuba
policy debate tended to support the father's claim over exile
relatives in Miami, who insisted the boy be granted political
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ``They showed what they were really all about,'' said Rep. Jim
McDermott, D-Wash., said of the Cuban-American hardliners. ``They
were ready to sacrifice one of their own kids, and they didn't
really care about separating him from his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Exile hardliners acknowledge missteps in handling the case. But
they deny it had any impact in what came next: a concerted drive by
U.S. business _ led by the Farm Bureau and the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce _ to open Cuba for business after 38 years of embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if there was any negativity surrounding the Elian
Gonzalez situation, it was pretty much self-contained,'' Cardenas
said. ``I think that basically people saw it as the equivalent of
the O.J. situation _ they just wanted it to be over, and out of
their living rooms,'' in a reference to the long saga surrounding
O.J. Simpson's murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Max Castro, a sociologist at the University of Miami's
North-South Center, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   During the seven-month struggle over Elian, Castro said, people
who had paid little attention to U.S. policy toward Cuba began to
ask questions about the hardline policy. ``Americans have basically
said it's a policy that hasn't worked, and it's inconsistent with
the rest of our foreign policy,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by lawmakers representing wheat and rice growers,
congressional Republicans agreed this week to lift the ban on sales
of food to Cuba, a move that has already been approved by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation officials portrayed the deal as merely symbolic,
noting that Congress' three Cuban-American lawmakers and other
allies had inserted language to deny cash-strapped Cuba any
financing by the federal government or U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby hurried efforts to regain its footing.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Thursday, the foundation introduced a new
addition to its Washington office. Dennis Hays, a former U.S.
ambassador in Suriname, is slated to become executive vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Hays, who is not Cuban-American, endeared himself to many exiles
in 1995, when he asked to be reassigned from his post as director
of the State Department's office of Cuban affairs. Hays was
protesting an accord secretly negotiated between the Clinton
administration and the Castro government that allowed the forced
repatriation of Cuban refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has also sought to renovate its image in its
Miami headquarters, which has long been dominated by
Cuban-Americans from Mas Canosa's generation, who recall the trauma
of exile.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Garcia, an energetic 35-year-old former chairman of
Florida's Public Service Commission, recently took over day-to-day
responsibilities as the foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Like the foundation's chairman, the 36-year-old Mas, Garcia has
never been to Cuba. He promises to update the foundation's image,
including ``more sophisticated'' media efforts to educate the
American people about Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly are going to see a reinvigorated foundation,''
said Garcia. He eschews the familiar ``bearded tyrant'' references
to President Castro, calling him instead ``this old goofball.''
</P>
<P>
   As a start, the foundation plans to run television
advertisements that highlight Castro's abuses. Beginning this
weekend, the foundation plans to air ads denouncing the safe haven
provided by Cuba to scores of fugitives from U.S. justice,
including Joanne Chesimard, who escaped from prison in 1979 after
being convicted for the murder of a New Jersey state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   The ads will air first in Washington, Cardenas said, but the
foundation plans to target the districts of key lawmakers who have
advocated an easing of sanctions, including Reps. George
Nethercutt, R- Wash., Republican, Jay Dickey, R-Ark., and Sens.
Blanche Lambert Lincoln, D-Ark., and Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said foundation officials risk further isolating
themselves with such tactics. ``Threatening people is not going to
help them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ To the dismay of gay rights groups and some civil
libertarians, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that it is
unconstitutional for the state to require a Boy Scout troop to
admit a gay scoutmaster. The court's decision, however, goes to the
heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of free association. It
may be a civil right to have access to employment, or to
transportation, or to hotels and restaurants. But it is not a civil
right to assist in raising other people's children.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the court had understandably ruled that society's
interest in ensuring access to certain opportunities like jobs,
school and other basic necessities must sometimes override the
right to associate with whomever one pleases. Everyone needs to
make a living. Everyone needs an education. Thus, the court ruled
that businesses or commercial gatherings like the Rotary Club
cannot exclude women from their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But serving as a role model for young children whose parents
share common values is not the same sort of privilege as a job or
an education. It is a service, and one entrusted to few people.
</P>
<P>
   To extend the reach of anti-discrimination laws to private
groups whose purpose is not to make a profit, but to bring together
people with similar values, would destroy the nation's diverse
tradition of voluntary collaboration for common causes. And a world
in which the government could declare which causes and which moral
positions benefit society, and which do not, could only be
described as Orwellian.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose when the Scouts informed James Dale that he could
not serve as a leader of a troop in Monmouth County, N.J. Dale
sued, claiming that the Scouts had unlawfully discriminated against
him because he was gay, and the New Jersey courts agreed. But the
Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, said that forcing a group to accept
certain members may impair its ability to ``express those views,
and only those views, that it intends to express.''
</P>
<P>
   Exercising the right to exclude others may seem intolerant, but
such a right is indispensable to private groups seeking to define
themselves, to chart their own moral course, and to work together
for common ends. If the Boy Scouts were required to admit leaders
who advocated a position contrary to its own, then men could assert
the right to lead the Girl Scouts, gentiles could assert the right
to head Jewish groups and heterosexuals could assert the right to
lead gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's supporters said that the case was about status-based
discrimination and that enforcing anti-discrimination laws against
voluntary groups like the Scouts was valid because anti-gay beliefs
are not what brought the Scouts together. But a group should not
need to have an anti-gay agenda to hold the view that homosexual
behavior is wrong. Many churches, for example, teach that
homosexual activity is immoral while affirming that gay people
should be treated with equal dignity and respect. That does not
mean that they have given up their right not to appoint homosexuals
to leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Americans, the Boy Scouts attempt to walk the line
between tolerance of everyone and disapproval of certain types of
conduct. That they wish to express their view by example or by
quiet persuasion, rather than an outspoken campaign, does not
diminish their right to take a position on moral issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the court's majority understood, people's rights to hold
moral positions, to associate with others who share the same views,
and to instill those views in their children without threat of
outside interference are liberties that belong as much to gay men
and lesbians as to the Boy Scouts, as much to those who advocate
alternative lifestyles as to those who advocate traditional
morality.

 &HT;    CDC: Students should know meningitis risk
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Alan and Lynn Bozof, a new federal recommendation
released today that suggests some college students should get a
meningitis vaccine is a bittersweet victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bozofs' 20-year-old son, Evan, died from bacterial
meningitis in 1998, after struggling with liver and lung failure
and undergoing amputations of his legs and arms in an attempt to
stop gangrene. An honor student and baseball pitcher, Evan first
became ill over spring break.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Bozofs were not even aware there was a vaccine
against the killer. But since Evan's death, they have pushed health
and college officials to educate students and their parents about
the benefits of vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   They have succeeded. In its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, the CDC states that colleges and health care providers
should make sure that college students _ especially incoming or
current freshman who plan to live in dorms _ are informed about the
disease and the vaccination.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation is based on research that found college
students, particularly freshman living in dorms, have an increased
risk for the disease compared with the general population. The
research indicates that meningococcal meningitis may be linked with
campus behavior, such as alcohol consumption, active and passive
smoking, intimate contact, shared utensils and irregular sleeping
and eating patterns.
</P>
<P>
   However, the federal agency stopped short of recommending that
all college students get vaccinated. The reason: Bacterial
meningitis is still primarily a stalker of the very young _ almost
40 percent of the 3,000 cases nationally involve children uounger
than 2. In contrast, about 100 cases annually involve college
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact is the risk is not so great (for the college
population) and we think that a blanket recommendation simply isn't
warranted,'' said Dr. Bradley Perkins, chief of the CDC's
Meningitis and Special Pathogens branch. ``But we do want people to
make an informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the vaccine, which costs between $55 and $75, does not
protect against all strains of the meningitis. It protects against
four types of bacteria that cause meningitis in the United States,
which account for nearly two-thirds of the cases. Researchers hope
to see a more effective second-generation vaccine licensed soon.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the state health department has no plans to
recommend widespread vaccination of college students. In the past
three years, two Georgia college students have died from the
illness. One was Bozof, a pre-med student at Georgia Southwestern
University in Americus, Ga.; the other was Charles Trevor Copp, 19,
a mechanical engineering major at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Copp, of suburban Atlanta, died last year shortly after
complaining of a headache. Another Georgia Tech student, Kevin
Moore, 22, of Columbus, Ga., also was diagnosed with the illness
within three days of Copp. He survived.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths helped spur an advisory panel to the state's Board of
Regents to issue a recommendation that college students should
consider the vaccine and schools should keep the vaccine in stock.
And according to the American College Health Association, more than
70 colleges and universities have policies recommending the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the Bozofs, who organize programs to
immunize seniors at Georgia high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is long and hard without (Evan),'' said Lynn Bozof.
``But we're happy that we might help save another life somewhere
else.''

 &HT;    Hawks will have time for Johnson
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He's representative of those prodigies Miss Jones
talks about in the Nike TV spots, the kids who decide when they're
18, 19, 20 that they're ready for the grown-up world of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Why, Miss Jones asks, is it such a big deal when kids such as
DerMarr Johnson decide to turn pro, when we have grown to fully
accept teens playing pro golf, tennis, and baseball _ not to
mention 12-year-old figure skaters and gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lon Kruger, in his second month as a pro coach, says its
cultural conditioning. ``We have traditional values for our
children,'' Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of the NBA, only No. 1 pick Kenyon Martin,
among the first 11 taken, actually played four years of college
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Johnson and the Hawks' staff made a symbolic climb to
the Hawks Nest in the upper reaches of Philips Arena, where Johnson
said, in a very matter of fact way, ``I was ready. I did what I
needed to achieve in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a year. One season. When the season ended in March, Johnson
stopped going to class. He knew where he was going. There was no
further need for math or English or social studies. He was still 19
when he made that decision.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing more that the college experience had to offer,
he says. ``I won't miss it. This is where I've been headed for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   He actually looked into coming out after his junior year in high
school. But in that instance, there are rules that require a young
man to finish four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about coming our after my senior year in high
school,'' he said, guessing he might have gone top 15. He said he
is glad he waited. He moved up nine spots to six.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for my year in college,'' he said. ``I don't regret
it. There are a lot of values that I learned. I got a lot of
experience. I played with great players and I played for a great
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the season was over, Johnson decided he was ready for
the next stop. ``I knew I was ready,'' he said. ``I did the things
I needed to do. I needed to improve my defense and I did that. Just
playing for Coach (Bob Huggins, a screamer) I got a lot done.''
</P>
<P>
   He played 32 games for a Cincinnati team ranked No. 1 until
Kenyon Martin broke his ankle in the second round of the Conference
USA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, someone asked Johnson how it felt to be
young and wealthy and on his own in a major city like Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the money (contract) yet,'' he said. ``I didn't
come out for the money. I came out because I was ready for the
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ready'' is a matter of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I spoke to D.J., I tried to talk to him about
staying in school,'' general manager Pete Babcock said, palms up in
a gesture of surrender. He recalled having the same conversation
last year with the less-accomplished Dion Glover, determined to
bolt Georgia Tech after a season. Babcock lost that argument and
took Glover with the 20th pick.
</P>
<P>
   Now Glover is a veteran of sorts, going one-on-one in the arena
practice gym against new assistant coach Rick Mahorn. Known for his
dedication to physical play, Mahorn will not allow Glover to call a
foul against him. Johnson, at 6-foot-9, 201 pounds, is four inches
taller and 30 pounds lighter than Glover. He will either get
stronger or Mahorn may break him in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will get stronger. He's got a great work ethic,'' Kruger
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock recalled that Kevin Garnett grew over two summers after
being drafted out of high school by Minnesota. ``We think it's
great to have a 6-9 guard and, who knows, we could end up with a
6-10 guard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever they want me to do,'' Johnson said,
maintaining a poker face under a long-brimmed Hawks cap that looked
absurd on a young giant wearing a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring whatever Coach Kruger wants me to bring to the
game,'' Johnson said, but his game will do the talking. It will
make the statements that he is too shy to verbalize.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows he can play. ``Oh, yeah, there's a lot I haven't
shown. I didn't show my whole game last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with Martin and another senior, Pete Mickeal, Johnson's
game at Cincinnati was catch and shoot, block some shots, pass the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   One night against Louisville he broke a 2-3-2 zone with five
straight 3-pointers. In back-to-back games against Marquette and
South Florida, he took the defensive assignment against their best
scorers and held them to a combined 4-for-15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great athleticism, great talent, great work ethic,''
Kruger said. ``All he needs is time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time? He's 20 years old.

ON THE CONTRARY: THE INVISIBLE HAND OF UNCLE SAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By DANIEL AKST    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the stirring announcement that scientists have more or less
succeeded in mapping the human genome, the private sector deserves
a lot of the credit. The energy and innovation of one company, the
Celera Genomics Group, a unit of the PE Corp., transformed a
plodding effort run by a public consortium into a feverish race.
The job got done faster than expected, and lives may be saved.
</P>
<P>
   But another important conclusion must be drawn from this
milestone, one that is crucial to business people lately inured to
such heresy. It is that Uncle Sam is not the consummate bumbler
he's made out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that stuff about Washington's irrelevance and
ineptitude, slumbering bureaucrats and leaden regulations. The U.S.
government is very good at some things, and directing the
consortium that did this great deed has proved to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   That this is news testifies to the apotheosis of private
enterprise in our age. To hear people talk, you'd never know it,
but the federal government has played a vital role at almost every
important juncture in the nation's economic development. When it
has erred, it has mainly been by bending over too far backward for
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Washington didn't build the great railroads, but it did secure
the continent and donate the land that made them pay. To the extent
that the atom has been harnessed (and despite all that no-nukes
business, it's been harnessed plenty), Uncle Sam's role was
central, from the Manhattan Project to manufacturing nuclear fuel.
The GI Bill helped create the graduates _ and the universities _
that fuel a modern technological economy. And the Interstate System
of highways opened up the suburbs, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Internet, this transforming technology, this spawner of
endless cant about the heroism of entrepreneurship, was cooked up
by Washington bureaucrats to connect far-flung universities working
on military projects.
</P>
<P>
   And now our genes.
</P>
<P>
   Did Celera play an important role? Sure. It brought to bear all
the hallmarks of its breed: It was nimble, smart, innovative and
daring. It did things faster and cheaper. And it had the benefit of
its rival's data: The government-sponsored Human Genome Project
posted its results on (there it is again) the Internet, where
Celera could use it to check its own work and to bridge gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the human genome is more or less cracked, the great
puzzle is why so many Americans in business seem to think their
government is good for nothing but squandering tax money. I think
it is because Uncle Sam, feeling his postwar oats, dove into a
series of quixotic battles that were better left unfought. The war
on drugs, after all, is no more successful than the war in Vietnam
or the war on poverty (though civil rights legislation has surely
helped on that front). Covert intervention overseas, Watergate, the
savings and loan debacle, partisan paralysis in Congress _ at every
turn, it seems, our kinsman by the Potomac has worked hard to waste
his accumulation of midcentury good will.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, government by nature tends to monopolize things,
and the evils of monopoly have never been more apparent.
Competition works: FedEx and the United Parcel Service have surely
forced the Postal Service to do better, and the mere threat of
vouchers has improved many a public school. Celera's aggressive
approach lit a fire under the government-backed consortium, and we
are all better off for it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the idea that government can't _ or shouldn't _ do anything
is hubristic nonsense, and was recognized as such by no less than
Adam Smith. If Washington is smart (stop laughing), it will both
learn from and build on its genome success _ redirect farm
subsidies into agricultural research, say, or open Amtrak's tracks
to competition from private passenger services, or use people's
natural self-interest to construct a universal health insurance
plan with built-in incentives to hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is being sensible, not dogmatic, about which things
government can do and which it should leave to business. With the
genome project, at least, Uncle Sam reminded us that he is capable
of being more than just an expensive umpire.

CLINTON PICKS FORMER CONGRESSMAN TO BE COMMERCE SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday nominated a former
congressman, Norman Mineta, as secretary of commerce for the final
six months of his presidency, laying the groundwork for Mineta to
become the first Asian-American to hold a Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, a Democrat, retired from the House in 1995 after 21
years representing the area of San Jose, Calif. He had been
chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, and
resigned in 1995 to become a senior vice president at Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mineta would replace William Daley,
who will formally step down on July 15 to become campaign chairman
for Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. He would be
Clinton's fourth commerce secretary, following Mickey Kantor and
the late Ron Brown, as well as Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta is 68. During World War II, when he was 10, his family
was loaded onto a train and taken to an internment camp in Wyoming
for Americans of Japanese descent. Years later, as a lawmaker,
Mineta helped pass legislation granting $20,000 in compensation to
every Japanese-American who had been interned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm Mineta's family story tells a lot about the promise of
the American dream and the power of one person's devotion to
opportunity and to justice,'' Clinton said in announcing the
selection Thursday morning in the Oval Office. Along with Mineta,
the president was joined by Daley and Robert Mallett, the deputy
commerce secretary, who had been a finalist for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination brought immediate praise from Asian-American
organizations. One side benefit of the selection, in the view of
administration officials, is that it may help blunt criticism from
Asian-Americans that followed the firing of Wen Ho Lee, the
government scientist accused of mishandling secrets at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory. Some Asian-Americans have also
expressed unhappiness over the scrutiny people of Asian descent
have faced during the investigations of campaign fund-raising
abuses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will go a long way toward bridging the divide,''
Mineta said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta acknowledged that, even with a quick confirmation, his
time in Clinton's Cabinet would be short. But he said that he was
not taking the job as a caretaker, and that he believed the
Commerce Department would remain active until the very end of the
president's term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might say that the months remaining in this
administration is not a lot of time to make a difference in the
life of our nation,'' Mineta said. ``But I disagree. Six months is
a virtual eternity in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta's decision to leave the House to go into private business
with a year to go in his term, and just 10 months after Republicans
seized control of Congress, rankled some of his Democratic
colleagues at the time. A Republican, Rep. Tom Campbell, won
Mineta's seat in a special election. Key Republican senators and
supporters predicted a quick confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who will do very well in the sprint to the
end,'' said Tom Donahue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
``He knows Congress well, and they know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some union leaders also praised Mineta, saying their main
concern with him was his support for the Clinton Administration's
free trade agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody, however, was enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his congressional voting record is any measure, he's
clearly out of touch with small business,'' said Nelson Litterst, a
spokesman for the National Federation for Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a considerable salary increase when he went into the
private sector, Mineta had clearly not turned his back entirely on
politics. He served as an informal adviser to Gore's presidential
effort and had recently considered a run for his old seat in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time Mineta had been offered a Cabinet post,
he said. In 1992, President-elect Clinton considered Mineta for
transportation secretary, and Mineta said Thursday that he had been
offered the job but turned it down. He was about to become a
committee chairman, and thought he could assist his party more in
that capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight years later, when another Cabinet offer came,
Mineta jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, called Mineta last
Friday to gauge his availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you interested?'' Podesta asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said he responded without hesitation: ``Do you want me to
crawl through the telephone line to your office right now?''

A MADISON AVENUE FANTASY 
</HEADLINE>
 0 2-NYT   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 (Editors: Double dashes beginning in 3rd graf are substituting for
bullets.)  
 By   FRED BROCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hit television show ``Survivor'' is credited with
rejuvenating CBS, attracting loads of those coveted viewers between
18 and 49. That means the network, which mature Americans have long
called their own, can now sell more ads at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   What remains difficult to understand is why Network Row and
Madison Avenue think young eyeballs are worth more to them than
older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these statistics:
</P>
<P>
   __ Seven baby boomers will turn 50 every minute until 2014,
according to American Demographics magazine.
</P>
<P>
   __ People over 50 have half the nation's disposable income, and
those over 65 enjoy twice the discretionary income of people 25 to
34, according to Theodore Roszak, the author of ``America the Wise:
The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The net worth of households headed by people over 60 grew by
30 percent over the last decade, double the national average,
according to a recent survey by the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   So what's going on? Why are advertisers acting like a bunch of
anti-Willie Suttons, aiming where the money increasingly isn't?
</P>
<P>
   Roszak suggests that corporate America and its media are at war
with the Census Bureau. In a 1998 article in Civilization, the
magazine of the Library of Congress, he put it succinctly: ``The
young are a vanishing breed. The future lies with the old.''
</P>
<P>
   While war may be too strong a metaphor, and the young aren't
really about to vanish, there is little doubt that the advertising
industry is generally well behind the curve of America's changing
demographic landscape. The reason may lie in the demographics of
the advertising business, where many decisions are made by people
in their 20s and 30s who have only the vaguest notion of, or
interest in, life past 50.
</P>
<P>
   Ann A. Fishman, 58, the president of the Generational-Targeted
Marketing Corp. in New Orleans, recalls a meeting she once had at
an ad agency in New York. ``I was struck by the fact that every
person I met except one was young,'' she said. ``But you can't have
one age group watching the store. You wind up not being sensitive
to the various generational groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the disconnect between Madison Avenue and demographic
reality more obvious than inside the covers of Modern Maturity,
published every other month by AARP. The magazine has two versions,
for working and retired subscribers, and a total circulation of
20.5 million, the largest of any magazine and almost double each of
its two closest competitors, Reader's Digest and TV Guide,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. By further
comparison, Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping have a
circulation of 4.5 million each; Time magazine's is 4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   But you would never guess the circulation of Modern Maturity
from its advertising volume. Publications aimed at younger people _
like women's fashion magazines, or Maxim for young men, or Fast
Company or Red Herring, which focus on technology, business and the
Internet _ attract so much advertising that they can be as fat as
phone books. But not Modern Maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this youth-market myopia, however, is likely to fade as
the 80 million baby boomers and their money decamp into the golden
years.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Novelli, associate executive director of public affairs for
AARP, says Modern Maturity is trying to position itself to rise
with the boomer tide. In 1998, the organization ditched its old
name, the American Association of Retired Persons. Surveys and
focus groups show that boomers hate words like ``retired'' that
remind them of ``old.'' A lot of people in their 60s and 70s don't
think of themselves as old, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big changes coming in the magazine,'' he said.
``It's going to become more of a lifestyle magazine, more vibrant
and youthful in its aim. We think we have enough elasticity to
appeal to both the 55-year-olds and the 75-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent covers, featuring celebrities like Paul Newman, Judge
Judy and Cheryl Tiegs, are signals of the changes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said executives are considering a switch to monthly
publication, the addition of newsstand sales and, perhaps, a change
in name.
</P>
<P>
   The repositioning will make the magazine more boomer-friendly
just as the advertising industry is about to be jerked into reality
by that aging group and its buying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media buyers and media planners are young,'' Novelli said. ``A
mind change has to take place. But they are awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet: Modern Maturity, which already charges advertisers about
one-third as much per subscriber as Time does, is considering
cutting its ad rates.  &QL;

COLUMN: MARKET SHOULDN'T GAMBLE ON SINGLE-STOCK FUTURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in the good old days, before there was a Securities and
Exchange Commission and before the 1929 crash and the Depression
that followed had given speculation a bad name, a plunger didn't
need to actually buy shares to get all the excitement of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   He or she could go to bucket shops, which offered the ability to
bet while putting up hardly any money. Unlike the real brokerage
houses, which wanted a buyer to pay 10 percent or 20 percent of the
stock's price to buy it, the bucket shops would let you ``buy'' a
$100 share for a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of that dollar was a commission, and the rest was the
margin. So if the stock fell 75 cents, your margin was wiped out
and the dollar was gone. But if the stock went up and you got out,
you could make money. Few did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business was tremendously profitable,'' wrote Edwin
Lefevre in his 1923 classic, ``Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,''
a fictionalized memoir of the life of the speculator Jesse
Livermore, who got his start in bucket shops. ``When it was
conducted legitimately _ I mean straight, as far as the bucket shop
went _ the fluctuations took care of the shoestrings. It doesn't
take much of a reaction to wipe out a margin of only three-quarters
of a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucket shops eventually gained a bad reputation. But they were
widely viewed as legitimate in the 1920s, even though speculators
never really purchased stock.
</P>
<P>
   Now the basic idea is back, albeit under a fancier name. The
futures markets want to trade ``single-stock futures,'' which in
economic terms are virtually identical to stocks. This week the
House and Senate agriculture committees unanimously approved bills
that would allow such trading even though many regulatory issues
remain unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Once they become legal, you will be able to buy single-stock
futures by putting up pennies on the dollar, in sharp contrast to
the stock market, where you have to put up half the purchase price.
The potential appeal is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the old bucket shops, futures markets have intraday
margin calls. If your stock future declines, you must put up more
cash immediately or be wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Futures in commodities like wheat make sense because they allow
for trading and price discovery without the need to ship millions
of bushels of wheat. The advent of stock index futures provided a
way to hedge risk on broad baskets of stocks. Single-stock futures
offer little more than a way to gamble on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The futures markets talk of single-stock futures as providing
``additional risk management tools,'' as Scott Gordon, chairman of
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, put it in an interview. They say
that you can already duplicate a single-stock future with a
complicated trade in the options market, so why worry?
</P>
<P>
   The idea that stocks are inherently risky, and that the
government should keep people from speculating with excessive
leverage, seemed obvious in the 1930s. Then, people thought the
1929 crash had been made worse because overleveraged investors had
been forced to sell. Seven decades later, such things are
forgotten, and free-market advocates claim that if we don't allow
such blatant gambling on stocks, the action will simply go to some
overseas market.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably inevitable that single-stock futures will begin
trading. But legislators who are voting in favor of them may regret
that decision if, before they choose to retire, the public once
again discovers that the stock market really is risky, and that
very high leverage can increase the risks for the speculators and
the entire system.

 &HT;    $1 billion in federal funds would help build high-speed rail
line from airport.
 &HT;    By Kelly Simmons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's all over but the waiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Regional Commission today will mail in its
application for $1 billion in federal money to begin building the
country's first magnetic levitation rail line.
</P>
<P>
   By Sept. 30, Atlanta _ and six other U.S. cities _ will find out
which of them has been selected to receive the money and the
economic development windfall expected to accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ARC planner Bob McCord, who led the maglev study, said Thursday
that while Federal Railroad Administration officials won't say how
Atlanta stacks up against other cities competing for the project,
they have been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `You guys in Atlanta have come a long way.' They're
very complimentary,'' McCord said. ``That tells me we've gotten
their attention, that we're competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed maglev project in Atlanta would run 32 miles
between Hartsfield International Airport in Clayton County to Town
Center in Kennesaw. Eventually, the line would be extended to
Chattanooga.
</P>
<P>
   Maglev lines use powerful magnetic fields to lift train cars
above the rail, propelling them with electricity at speeds of up to
300 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is seeking to build the first demonstration leg of a
rail line. The elevated track would roughly follow I-75. Four
stations are proposed: at the airport; near the Vine City MARTA
station; at Cumberland/Galleria; and at Town Center near Kennesaw
State University. The train would travel at 80 mph to 120 mph
through Atlanta, reaching a top speed of 240 mph. Fares would range
from $4.75 to $27.25 to travel the full length of the route.
</P>
<P>
   The initial 32-mile rail line is expected to cost about $2.2
billion. That cost _ about $57 million per mile _ is not out of
line with other rail projects in the region. New MARTA rail lines
cost about $100 million per mile, according to the ARC.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the maglev cost must come from local sources.
McCord said the ARC, Georgia Department of Transportation and the
Georgia Regional Transportation Authority have pledged to come up
with $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   In-kind contributions from private companies are included in the
local match. Companies that are interested in taking part in the
project include Georgia Power Co., which would provide electricity
to operate the rail line; and Lockheed Martin, which could assemble
rail cars and possibly operate the system, McCord said. The ARC
estimates the project could generate 6,000 new jobs for the region.
</P>
<P>
   The other areas vying to build the maglev line are Los Angeles,
Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Las Vegas, Washington-Baltimore and
Florida's Cape Canaveral.

<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite the promise that HMOs would take care of the
details and let doctors be doctors, Massachusetts physicians are
complaining that they are more miserable than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,400 physicians released Thursday, one-quarter
said they are ``very dissatisfied'' with managed care, five times
the number who were unhappy four years ago. The dissatisfaction has
grown even though health insurance companies say they've worked
hard to improve life in the exam room since the first statewide
survey in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors' most persistent complaints were that managed care
companies took too long to pay their bills and to approve referrals
to psychologists and psychiatrists. Physicians rated the different
health plans more similarly this year, but were overall more
negative about them as a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend an hour a day on the phone trying to get referrals,''
said Dr. Virginia Latham, an internist and president of the
Massachusetts Medical Society, as she announced the results.
``That's 12 patients I could have spent five more minutes with.
These problems aren't just hassles that bother doctors personally.
They prevent them from caring for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Few professionals have their happiness on the job monitored and
measured the way doctors do. But when managed care _ the movement
to control health care costs _ began sweeping through the state in
the early 1990s, doctors began to feel beleaguered. So the medical
society decided to try and figure out the specific problems and
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   But as is typical in Boston health care, where the players have
known each for years and politeness is valued, the medical society
invited the health plans to join them in the study. And Thursday,
as doctors ran down their list of gripes at a news conference, HMO
executives patiently listened and then had their chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are very unhappy and much more unhappy than the
last time around,'' said Paul D. Cleary of Harvard Medical School,
a researcher who helped conduct the study for the medical society
and the HMOs. ``The thing is, we don't understand why. The specific
things we looked at don't seem to account for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians were asked to rate five different health plans: Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim Health
Care, Tufts Health Plan, Fallon Community Health Plan and Health of
New England. They rated the availability of behavioral health
services as poor, with Fallon receiving the lowest score.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors scored claims processing as fair to good and the ease of
appealing denied claims as fair, with Harvard Pilgrim fairing the
worst on both counts. For all the plans _ except for Health of New
England, which was not part of the 1996 survey _ doctors said they
are less likely to recommend them to their families now than they
were four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robin S. Richman, medical director for Tufts, said that when
the HMOs received results from the first survey in 1996, they tried
to fix the complaints with a host of new programs. Tufts reduced
turnaround time for paying claims by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim substantially reduced the number of procedures
requiring pre-authorization from the health plan. And HMO Blue, the
HMO run by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, adopted an
electronic referral system. Together, the HMOs instituted a joint
credentialing procedure for physicians joining their networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite that, when we look at the dissatisfaction it didn't
seem to be enough,'' Richman said. ``This may reflect more
discontent with the general health care environment. We will
certainly do our part _ as much of it as is in our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph L. Dorsey, medical director for Harvard Pilgrim, said
that even though his employer drew the worst scores on paying
claims, the survey was conducted during the health plan's most
chaotic period: last June to November. Harvard Pilgrim was forced
into state receivership in January and just released this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Claims are going through like greased lightening now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical directors said that most doctors still submit their
claims, or bills, on paper through the mail _ although the rate
varies by health plan. Blue Cross receives 85 percent of claims
electronically while Tufts receives less than 40 percent
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic transactions ``are the direction we all need to go
in. But that requires significant investment,'' said Blue Cross
Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kurt Sligar.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right now we're all broke,'' added Dr. Thomas Ebert of
Health of New England in western Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alice Neel could be witheringly blunt. ``Art is not
as stupid as human conversation,'' she was once quoted as saying. I
wrote it down and pinned it up at my desk, struck by its weirdness.
In its unequivocal dismissal of daily discourse, Neel's remark
gives one a glimpse of a certain darkness: the misanthropy and
self-protective brutality that, along with more positive instincts,
may be part of the commitment to being an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Neel, who died in 1984 at the age of 84, acted on that
commitment for nearly 60 years, making some of the 20th century's
best paintings, especially portraits, as demonstrated by the
illuminating but insufficient retrospective of her work that opened
Thursday at the Whitney Museum of American Art and remains through
Sept. 17. It has been organized by Ann Temkin, the curator of
modern and contemporary art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and
will make four more stops over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, Neel also knew how to use her mouth. She
negotiated the bureaucracies of the WPA and public assistance and
was active in artists' political groups throughout her life. She
gave pithy interviews as interest in her work grew.
</P>
<P>
   Neel was known for talking almost nonstop as she painted her
subject, often detailing the amazing ups and downs of her colorful
life, with its poverty, many love affairs, radical politics and
children born out of wedlock. She lived her life exactly as she
pleased and said so. A round-table discussion about the experience
of sitting for Neel appears in the catalog, and the painter Benny
Andrews recalls that she told him: ``I'm cursed to be in this
Mother Hubbard body. I am a real sexy person.''
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear Neel talking at the Whitney. Talking to her
friends, lovers, children and grandchildren as she painted them.
Talking strangers into sitting for her, like the lean, nattily
dressed Fuller Brush man whom she painted in 1965, learning in the
process that he was a Holocaust survivor. Talking people who had
already agreed to pose into doing so nude.
</P>
<P>
   An innate egalitarian, Neel had to be voluble and gregarious to
have painted so many people unlike herself. From her Greenwich
Village bohemia phase of the 1930s, there is a demonic portrait of
Joe Gould, the slightly-crazed, Harvard-educated street person
immortalized in Joseph Mitchell's famous New Yorker article, whom
she depicted with three sets of genitals.
</P>
<P>
   From her days in Spanish Harlem, where she lived in the 1940s
and '50s, first with a singer named Jose Santiago and then with the
photographer and filmmaker Sam Brody, there is something of a
rainbow coalition of faces: from 1959, twin black girls, no older
than 4 or 5, stare up at the artist with quiet curiosity; from
1955, Georgie Arce, a friendly Hispanic youth, is seen against a
lush pink background; from 1946, a dark-haired young woman in a
red-striped blouse leans against a wall of arabesque-patterned
wallpaper, looking like a Semitic princess.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1960s and '70s, when Neel finally began to get the
critical attention she deserved, there are portraits of art-world
figures: the dealer Elinor Poindexter looking almost as loony as
Joe Gould; a withdrawn Andy Warhol stripped to the waist, the awful
scars of Valerie Solanas' assassination attempt mapping his sunken
chest; and the art critics (and at the time lovers) Gregory
Battcock and David Bourdon, their differences signaled by the first
being in his underwear and the other in a suit and tie.
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that Neel's distinctive expressionistic
realism, as some critics called it, can be described as extremely
loquacious. In her mature work all the parts of each painting have
their say: colors carry on one conversation, textures and brushwork
another, her oddly distorted bodies, limbs and facial features a
third. The avid expressions on most of Neel's subjects, which
contribute greatly to her work's intensity, show that they were
listening to her, often riveted.
</P>
<P>
   If Neel's life was a big subject, her art is too, and this
exhibition indicates that without doing it justice. The timing
could not have been better. Portraiture and figurative painting are
abundant; the body continues to be a consuming subject; and art
about identity, sexuality and orientation is increasingly nonverbal
and representational.
</P>
<P>
   But the show feels cramped. It is top-heavy with the portraits
of her last 25 years, when she mostly painted members of the art
world or her family. These include many strong pictures, one being
the portrait of a young, nervous Robert Smithson surrounded by
agitated brushwork from 1962, when Smithson was an unknown painter
of Expressionistic, cartoony canvases, not yet a bad-boy earth
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The show's smallness and imbalance short-change the first 35
years of Neel's career and also her work in landscape, genre and
still life. A few exceptions include a wonderful early still life,
``Symbols'' from 1933, with its sweet yet subtly sexual arrangement
of doll and apples, and a powerful later one, ``Thanksgiving'' from
1967. This work, in which Neel depicts the dead fowl of traditional
still-life painting plucked and draining in a kitchen sink, is one
of several instances in which she brings an art-historical subject
down to earth with a specifically feminist thud.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition perpetuates the picture of Neel as a late bloomer
when in fact she was also precocious, creating original work true
to herself and her time at nearly every stage of her career. In
this regard she is very much like Stuart Davis, six years her
senior. Like Davis, Neel in her early work operates fruitfully in
the gap between the pioneering American modernists of the Stieglitz
circle and the Abstract Expressionists.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis translated Cubism into an American vernacular, Neel
was drawn to the Expressionism of Munch and van Gogh. Her
translation incorporated elements of the Ash Can School and
American Scene painting and Social Realism. It also drew from the
straightforward evocation of American faces in the photographs of
Lewis W. Hine, Walker Evans and Helen Levitt (a point that Susan
Rosenberg, the assistant curator in Philadelphia, develops in her
catalog essay), the emotionally resonant simplifications of
American folk art and at times the hallucinatory strangeness of
Charles Burchfield. In the end, Neel, like Davis, benefited from
the bolder tactics of Abstract Expressionism and Pop, making her
work an indelible part of postwar American art.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great story, as is Neel's life, but it exceeds the limits
of this often rewarding show. This failure is partly architectural,
a reflection of the Whitney's constricting ``one floor one artist''
approach. Neel should not be a one-floor artist. Her six-decade
career deserves to be examined chapter and verse, on paper and
canvas, which would require at least one-and-a-half if not two of
the Whitney's floors. It's all the more galling that downstairs
from Neel, a dozen large recent works by Robert Rauschenberg loll
about in oceans of space. Maybe this show will grow a bit as it
proceeds on its tour. At present, it keeps Neel in her modest,
somewhat marginalized place, a position that the Whitney was
created to subvert.

FLIGHT DELAYS LINKED TO CONTROVERSIAL RUNWAY PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>

 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Passengers flying in and out of Logan International
Airport this summer should be prepared for long delays, up to two
hours for some arriving flights, and the cause has nothing to do
with weather or antiquated air-traffic control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A widespread pilot boycott of a landing procedure used on
intersecting runways is causing numerous lengthy delays at Logan as
well as Chicago's O'Hare and Miami International airports. Pilots
say they were forced into the action because of recent government
changes to the procedure, known as land and hold short operations,
or LAHSO, have not been adequately tested for safety by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is causing a lot of pain to this airport, mainly with the
arrival rate,'' said Massport aviation director Thomas J. Kinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedure, which is designed to increase capacity at
airports, a landing plane is directed to stop and hold short of an
intersecting runway used by departing planes or other landing
planes. When pilots use the procedure, Logan can accept 58 to 60
arriving airplanes an hour. Without it, that rate drops to 38 and
hour. The procedure is used at Logan when there is a southwest wind
_ the prevailing wind in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA says the boycott is affecting air travel throughout the
nation during the busy summer season, which has also been plagued
by weather-related delays. From June 1 through June 19, 514 flights
were delayed at O'Hare International Airport because of the
boycott, 242 flights in Boston were held up, and 101 at Miami
International Airport did not arrive or depart on time. The agency
would not provide updated figures.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott is also causing frustration for controllers
confronted with rebellious pilots who have refused requests to use
the landing procedure _ an action virtually unheard of in the
crisp, precise relationship between pilots and air-traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   Several sources said controllers in Boston have had to deal with
planes that agreed to use the procedure when they departed for
Boston but refused to perform it on final approach to Logan. In
Chicago, some pilots have refused controllers' requests to exit
onto a high-speed taxiway to make way for other planes and instead
have continued down an active runway.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure has been used for nearly 30 years, and Logan was
involved in testing it in the 1970s. But the number of planes,
passengers and flights have jumped dramatically since then _ along
with delays. As a result, about two years ago, the FAA proposed
augmenting the procedure to increase capacity at airports like
Logan where runways intersect.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA changes included asking foreign pilots and some general
aviation pilots to use the procedure and formalizing rules under
which a pilot can abort a LAHSO landing. The changes were set to be
adopted last month, but pilot protests prompted the FAA not to
include foreign and general aviation pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents some 58,000
pilots in the United States and Canada, said the final order still
raised safety concerns, however, and urged all pilots not to
perform the landing procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In layman's terms, the essence of a LAHSO procedure is that it
takes two airplanes that are on, or are approaching, two
intersecting runways, aims them at each other, and trusts the
system will keep them from actually colliding,'' Duane Woerth, the
association's president, said last month in announcing the union's
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Runway incursions have been increasing in recent years, despite
efforts by the FAA to reduce them. More than 45 people were killed
in runway collisions in the last decade and the world's worst
commercial aviation accident occurred in Tenerife when two 747s
collided, killing 583 people.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's union is still concerned that the FAA's land and
hold short system is not completely safe because the agency has not
adequately tested the ramifications of a pilot aborting the landing
procedure just as another plane is taking off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stay in the air because you rejected a landing and the
guy taking off may or may not be aware of it, so his options are
limited and your options are limited,'' said a union official, who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The union has said that once issue of aborted landings is
resolved, it would advise pilots to accept requests to use the
landing procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to have even one pilot miss the message that
the safety of rejected landing procedures in the LAHSO environment
is questionable,'' said Woerth. ``The best way to ensure universal
understanding is to keep the message simple: We recommend that
pilots not participate in any LAHSO at any airport until all safey
questions are answered.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman William Shumann said the agency is working closely
with the union, air-traffic controllers and the airlines on
computer modeling of rejected landing procedures. But those talks
have been going on for more than a year, and Shumann said there is
no timetable for settling the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Until there is a resolution, airline passengers and air traffic
controllers are caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly appreciate the safety concerns being raised by
pilots, but my plea is why can't we at least go back to what was
acceptable for the pilot community before and practiced for nearly
30 years,'' said Massport's Kinton. ``This has knocked capacity at
some airports back to the mid-1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinton said delays at Logan are typically 15 to 30 mintues for
outbound flights and one to two hours inbound. The inbound delays
are so significant that planes are held on the ground in other
cities by air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA was giving pilots who agreed to use the landing
procedure an earlier release time from their departure airports,
but pilots accepting the early release then changed their minds
when they were cleared to land at Logan, Kinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Planes from the southern airports bound for Boston are sequenced
into a pattern that begins over North Carolina. To have a plane
cleared for landing and then reject a LAHSO landing can result in
its being pulled out of the sequence at the last minute and put
into a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, controllers are scrambling around,'' said
William Blackmer, director of safety and technology for the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   And controllers are certain that once planes are circled around
back into the landing pattern, the pilot tells passengers the delay
is due to air traffic, not on the decision to refuse to implent the
landing procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration level in Boston is very high,'' said Wade
Stanfield, safety committee chairman for the controllers' union.
For the airlines, the boycott is yet another headache in a season
of delays, many of which are weather-related. ``We are already in
an awful delay season and it is unfortunate that pilots are
refusing the procedure,'' said David Fuscus, a spokesman for the
Air Transport Association.

   Gordon is the epitome of slacker, a slender string of a
do-nothing whose passivity is part of his charm. As played by Peter
Fenton in the Australian film ``Praise,'' an absorbing tale of

   He has the look of a poet, if not exactly the soul of one, which
is probably what attracts Cynthia (Sacha Horler). She sizes up this
Slim Jim, peels away the wrapper and goes to work, and her appetite
pulls him into an affair. He is dragged into it by her neediness
and her fury, and Cynthia's robust fearlessness is the crucial
element in this romantic melodrama, which is so vivid you can smell
the anxiety pouring off the lovers' flesh.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it on hers, as she suffers from eczema so severe
that her skin has huge patches that are mottled and raw; her nerve
endings cry out for attention. And if Gordon isn't just the man to
give it, then she'll take it from him. (He has physical problems,
too, among them asthma and heroin addiction.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise'' has been burning up the track on the film festival
circuit for two years. I have yet to see it with an audience that
hasn't stood outside the theater caught up in conversation
afterward. It's Tennessee Williams with the ragged heedlessness of
post-punk; it could be more haunted only if the soundtrack included
the dolorous moan of the underground rock band Low. (The soundtrack
itself, by Dirty Three, is quite good and worth seeking out, though
very hard to find.)
</P>
<P>
   And that glint of trouble is probably what has scared
distributors away. As Gordon and Cynthia tumble into a squalid
world where they focus more and more on each other, things get
worse. Essentially the movie is plotless. The director, John
Curran, working with the writer Andrew McGahan, doesn't linger on
unrelenting unpleasantness. There are jolts of humor in the big,
empty room littered with beer bottles where Cynthia spends most of
her time falling all over Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Praise'' is uncanny and sizzling because it has the apparently
aimless feel of a bad love affair of youth, the kind of story you
would overhear the thoughtless Gordon telling somebody; you would
move your chair closer to catch every seamy, and often hilarious,
detail. That seemingly floating quality, as the relationship slumps
into one bad incident after another, is precisely what Curran
wants. For him the film's explicit detail spells out the
compulsiveness of his characters, something that keeps them
together.
</P>
<P>
   Horler's frank performance is something else that keeps
``Praise'' together. With all the predictable bad taste in films,
it's quite something to be startled not by mean-spirited jokes, but
by an actress' openness. And her Cynthia, who is given to wearing
sleeveless dresses to expose the eruptions on her skin and her soft
fleshiness, is utterly aware that she and Gordon are wrong for each
other and determined to stay the course anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pungent, poignant and full of honest sentiment, ``Praise'' has a
complicated emotional intelligence that is hard to come by in
movies these days. Some viewers may find the dissipation
self-conscious or arty; the meticulousness of Curran's direction
and Dion Beebe's cinematography, as well as the carefully appointed
mess of Cynthia and Gordon's living quarters, are hard to miss.
Then again, there are always those who look for reasons that a
movie that affects them isn't worth their time, even as the picture
sticks with them. And ``Praise'' will stick with you. It's more
than worthy of its title. &QL;

ABORTION FOES TO CONTINUE PUSH FOR FEDERAL PARTIAL-BIRTH BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wounded but unbowed by a blow from the US Supreme
Court, antiabortion leaders Thursday vowed to press on for a
federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, to insist the GOP
not waver on a human-life amendment in its platform, and to defeat
Al Gore in the presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Wednesday's ruling that struck down Nebraska's ban
on certain abortion procedures energized the activists to demand
that Texas Governor George W. Bush make abortion politics a more
prominent part of his presidential campaign _ a commitment he has
been trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Governor Bush is where he needs to be on
abortion, and we have a responsibility to get him there,'' said
Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, an antiabortion
advocacy group. Brown said her phones have been ``ringing off the
hook'' since the ruling. ``Our people want to know what it means,
why did it happen, and what can they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who opposes abortion rights and Wednesday pledged to fight
for a ban on what he called ``the brutal practice of partial-birth
abortion,'' has been criticized by social conservatives for
refusing to apply an antiabortion litmus test to his choice of a
running mate and any prospective nominees for the Supreme Court. To
prove he is a ``compassionate conservative'' and to woo women who
support the right to choose, Bush rarely brings up the abortion
issue as he campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has tried to be open and down the middle about abortion,
but now it is going to be much more diffcult to be in the middle,''
said Susan Cullman, who co-chairs the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition. ``The Supreme Court decision will arouse the right wing
and encourage them to be stronger. That is good news for the
prochoice people, but it is not good news for our candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a consultant to Bush and a former executive director
of the Christian Coalition schooled in grass-roots abortion
politics, said he did not expect the Supreme Court's ruling to have
much impact on the centrist course of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Bush to remain true to his conservative
principles, but you win elections by talking about the issues on
which voters in the middle are turning, and that's education,
expanding the circle of prosperity, and Social Security,'' Reed
said. ``Those are the issues that will decide this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who supports abortion rights and frequently talks about it
in campaign speeches, praised the court's decision, while his
campaign delighted in the news that the high court was stirring up
passions over abortion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision brings the issue closer to home for more voters,
and by virtue of that, it will loom larger in our campaign,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There was no disagreement between advocates and foes on the
stakes in this election: The Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 that
certain abortion procedures are unconstitutional, is more closely
divided than ever on the issue that continues to polarize the
country. With three of the justices at least 70 years old, the
probability is high that the next president will get one or more
nominees and the opportunity to tip the court's balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two candidates are absolutely and diametrically opposed
to each other on a woman's right to choose, it is our challenge to
repeat over and over again to American voters that the Supreme
Court is at risk,'' said Alice Germond, executive vice president of
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL officials have told Warren Christopher, the former
secretary of state who is leading Gore's search for a running mate,
that the choice of Indiana Senator Evan Bayh would be ``very
problematic'' because last year he voted in favor of legislation to
ban what opponents call partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a clear difference between Bush and Gore,
and to confuse that in any way would make it more difficult to
mobilize activists and voters,'' Germond said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who opposed Bush in the GOP primaries, said Bush has
to learn from Democrats that you need to secure your core
supporters, in his case, conservatives, before veering to the
center. ``Prolife people are pretty depressed and are looking for
more reassurance that a Bush presidency would matter,'' Bauer said.
``In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, it would be a
political mistake for him to pick a prochoice running mate, water
down the GOP platform, or avoid the abortion issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and representatives of a number of conservative groups
were on Capitol Hill Thursday pressing the GOP to keep a strong
antiabortion plank in its platform. Others in the Capitol were
poring over the Supreme Court's ruling, trying to determine how a
partial-birth abortion bill that has passed the House and awaits
Senate action could be modified to pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawmakers are going to want to study the opinion carefully and
decide how to respond,'' Douglas Johnson, legislative director for
the National Right to Life Committee, said, predicting the bill
would pass and be sent to President Clinton, who has twice vetoed
similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of its ruling, the Supreme Court Thursday ordered
lower courts to review their decisions upholding bans on certain
abortion procedures in Illinois and Washington state. The court
also let stand a ruling that struck down Iowa's ban.

DISEASES POSE SECURITY RISK, CIA SPECIALST TELLS LAWMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They ride on the wings of mosquitoes. They cling to
microscopic droplets when you cough. They pass in sex.
</P>
<P>
   They are the newest national security threat: infectious
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A senior CIA analyst, in the first congressional airing on the
issue, told a House committee Thursday that emerging infectious
diseases will pose a ``rising and in the worst case catastrophic''
global health threat that could seriously undermine US national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``These diseases will endanger US citizens at home and abroad,
threaten US armed forced deployed overseas, and exacerbate social
and political instability in key countries and regions in which the
United States has significant interests,'' said David F. Gordon,
national intelligence officer for economics and global issues at
the CIA's National Intelligence Council.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing called by the House International Relations
Committee, lawmakers and top health officials grappled with the
difficulties in trying to contain the spread of the lethal microbes
in an age of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony underlined the increasing threat from infectious
diseases, many of which have steadily become more drug-resistant
due to underuse of antibiotics in poor countries and overuse in
wealthier ones.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented act earlier this year that linked global
health and security, President Clinton declared HIV/AIDS a national
security threat. It stemmed from a declassified National
Intelligence Estimate coordinated by Gordon that explored the
implications of the spread of infectious disease for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon told the panel Thursday of an ``increasing possibility''
of a biological terrorist attack against the United States and that
the attack could be spread through an infectious disease. He also
addressed the potential impact on US troops abroad, saying that
those deployed to support humanitarian operations ``in developing
and former communist countries will be at highest risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the developing world, nearly half of all deaths are
attributed to treatable infectious diseases. The National
Intelligence Estimate found that four of the ``deadly seven''
infectious diseases _ AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and hepatitis B
and C _ were ``either spreading or becoming more drug-resistant.''
The other three _ lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases
and measles _ appear to have ``at least temporarily peaked.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is passed through sex or dirty syringes, tuberculosis
through droplets often when coughing or sneezing, malaria through
the bite of a mosquito. Many others are transmitted through water
or food.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony given by Gordon and others Thursday, examples were
used again and again showing that national borders did nothing to
keep out infectious diseases. They cited several examples in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last's year outbreak in New York of West Nile virus, which was
carried by migratory birds, killed seven people. In the last six
months of 1999, 56 people in South Texas were found to have dengue
fever, a tropical disease. Also last year, two Boy Scouts acquired
malaria at a summer camp in rural New York. And just last Sunday, a
Rochester, N.Y., man died of bacterial meningitis on a flight from
Tel Aviv to New York; New York health authorities now are concerned
that others on the flight may have been infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot put a fence around America and hope to keep the
diseases out,'' said Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut,
the committee's ranking Democrat. ``We cannot stop Americans from
traveling overseas for business or vacation; we cannot stop
protecting our interests abroad and just keep our armed forces
locked in their barracks for fear of catching a deadly disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If this were a military invasion, it would be easier
to galvanize the public and policy makers. ... For humanitarian and
self-survival reasons, we need to face this challenge as if it were
an invading army.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, took the
thought another step, saying, ``Historians will wonder why in our
defense budget we spent so much defending ourselves from missiles,
and so little from diseases. Perhaps the NIH (National Institutes
of Health) will be the next Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has estimated that it would cost
$1.5 billion a year for the next decade for medicines and
prevention to stop the spread of the major infectious diseases.
Numerous bills in Congress propose trust funds to stem the spread
of diseases, including legislation passed by the House to spend
$500 million over five years for a World Bank AIDS fund.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon General David Satcher delivered a sobering statistical
look at AIDS, especially in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, which
has, he noted, ``5,500 funerals occurring each day in the region''
from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Due to AIDS, he said, demographers have projected that life
expectancy by the year 2010 will fall from 66 to 33 years in Zambia
and from 70 to 40 years in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, CIA analyst Gordon said that while AIDS was
the only disease formally named a national security threat, other
infectious diseases also posed a threat.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said that US officials were closely watching
the spread of multi-drug resistant TB, especially in Russia and
other former Soviet states. ``Drug-resistant TB is going to be one
of the very large strategic problems in the next few years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He made the point that an outbreak far from home still will be
felt here.
</P>
<P>
   The worst infectious diseases are ``likely to slow economic
development and undermine the social structures in some
countries,'' posing major complications to US foreign policy, he
said. ``This will challenge democratic development and transitions,
and possibly contribute to humanitarian emergencies and military
conflicts to which the United States might expect to respond.''

YOU PAID THAT BILL WITH A CLICK. OR DID YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He did not seem the problem-credit type when he sat down across
the desk from Kathy Egan, a mortgage loan officer in Boston, to
talk about refinancing a $200,000 mortgage on a $330,000 home. He
was a financial services executive making more than $1 million a
year; approval seemed certain, Egan recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When a routine credit check turned up three late mortgage
payments, Egan said, her client was floored. He had been using his
bank's electronic payment service and had a stack of statements
showing debits to his checking account a few days before each
payment was due.
</P>
<P>
   What the statements did not show, and the executive did not
realize, was that he had stumbled into a significant pitfall of
electronic bill payment _ one of a several attracting concern from
consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic bill-paying is being oversold to consumers,'' said
Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action, an advocacy
organization based in San Francisco. In some cases, McEldowney and
others say, the systems may deliver the opposite of what they
promise: more delayed payments, more late fees, and more
hard-to-spot, hard-to-correct problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston executive's stained credit is a case in point. He
mistakenly thought that his mortgage lender received his payments
as soon as the money left his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads make it sound like all of your bills will be paid
electronically,'' McEldowney said of electronic services in
general. ``But only some creditors have such arrangements. If not,
your bank has to write a check and mail it to your creditor.''
Because such checks are not accompanied by the original payment
stub, posting can be delayed even further.
</P>
<P>
   In the executive's case, Egan said, accumulating late fees meant
that his payments never caught up with the problem. ``He thought he
was getting convenience with online payments,'' she said.
``Instead, his credit report got damaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic bill-paying is growing in popularity. According to
Avivah Litan, a research director at Gartner, a research firm based
in Stamford, Conn., 2.5 million households regularly paid bills
last year using a personal computer; 4 million are expected to do
so this year. And perhaps a million more households go to systems
by telephone or other means.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to make payments electronically, with or
without a personal computer and with or without bills arriving in
the mail. Most fall into four categories:
</P>
<P>
   __ Pre-authorized direct debit. Creditors automatically obtain
payment from your bank account on a schedule you authorize in
advance. Creditors may offer discounts for paying this way. This
method is suitable for fixed payments like those on a loan, but
risky for bills that fluctuate and may contain errors or
unauthorized charges.
</P>
<P>
   __ Consumer-initiated payments. You continue to receive bills in
the mail and must instruct the bill-payment service by computer
link or by phone to pay each one. The service mails checks to any
creditors that are not equipped to receive payment electronically.
</P>
<P>
   __ Creditors' Web sites. Some utilities, phone companies, credit
card issuers and others let you view bills online and then
authorize the company to debit your bank account. This can be
cumbersome for more than a few bills a month.
</P>
<P>
   __ Third-party consolidators. Instead of receiving bills at
home, you arrange to have them sent, electronically or by mail, to
the consolidator, which stores them in its computers. Typically,
you then receive e-mail notification that they are ready to be
viewed and paid online.
</P>
<P>
   All four methods offer some measure of what a recent Gartner
survey found to be the main attraction of electronic bill-paying:
convenience. But for many people who use the services, there are
also drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   George Barto, another research director at Gartner, said 37
percent of respondents who use online banking services said they
disliked losing control and not knowing exactly when a bill would
be paid, while 14 percent cited trouble coordinating deposits with
payments and 11 percent worried that bills would not be paid on
time.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, electronic payment services can claim some
cost savings over checking accounts _ no check printing or postage
costs, for example. Most services charge a monthly fee, though
banks may waive the fee for good customers, and other providers may
waive the fee for a few months as an introductory offer.
</P>
<P>
   When payments are not immediate, however, there can be a hidden
cost to consumers: loss of the ``float.'' With traditional checks,
the money remains in your account until they clear. With electronic
payments, the money may leave your account immediately, though it
may not reach your creditor for a week or more. Unable to know the
exact payment date, many consumers try to avoid late payment
problems by authorizing electronic payments a few days earlier than
they might have mailed paper checks.
</P>
<P>
   Payments that are too early present another pitfall, as Holly
Anderson, 29, a public relations executive in Washington, learned
when she took the electronic route to paying off a credit-card
balance. She chose to pay $100 a month, much more than the minimum
due. As is often the case, finance charges on Anderson's account
are calculated on the average daily balance, so to save some
interest she wanted to pay as early in each billing cycle as she
could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'd pay before I got the next bill, something I
would not have done if I were writing a check,'' she said. ``But
instead of crediting the early payment for the next month, they
would credit it as a second payment in the current month. Then I'd
get hit with a $29 fee for not making my minimum'' for the next
month. She now waits an extra week, undermining her strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Security can be a big issue, especially with services not run by
banks. ``Anyone can claim to be a bill-paying service,'' McEldowney
said. ``We're already seeing some prepaid-phone-card companies
becoming cash-strapped and leaving consumers with worthless prepaid
cards. It could conceivably happen with bill-paying services that
aren't FDIC-insured.''
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is another concern. A consumer who uses a consolidator,
especially, is trusting the company _ and the Internet at large _
with an extraordinary amount of sensitive personal information that
could be misappropriated by a rogue employee, a hacker or a con
artist. Cary Whaley, a spokesman for Nacha, an electronic payments
trade association, said the industry takes the concerns seriously.
``Consolidators who do not hold information private will go out of
business in a heartbeat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McEldowney warned that ``small mistakes in keying in the
Web address can send you to a `spoofer' site that looks legitimate
but is run by criminals to get you to reveal your account number
and password.'' He advised bookmarking the genuine Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Even a secure transmission to the correct Web address can
contain small, unnoticed errors that later prove troublesome.
Deborah Thornton, a fund-raiser in Wellesley, Mass., recalled her
surprise when she received a cutoff notice from a utility. She
checked her records, which showed timely electronic payments _ but
to an account number that was one digit off. ``Someone else had
been receiving my payments and never said a word,'' she said.
(MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Payments that go astray or are accidentally duplicated can be
difficult to retrieve. Noise on Thornton's phone line once broke
her computer connection before she received a confirmation of her
payment instructions. When she dialed back to finish the
transaction, she unwittingly paid all 15 bills a second time. She
spotted the error a few days later and rushed to the bank for help,
but was rebuffed. ``They told me, `this happens all the time,'''
she said, but that it was up to her to get refunds on her own. Most
ultimately cooperated, she said, ``but I was on the verge of firing
the guy who was cutting my grass, so he never refunded the extra
$100.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bank makes a mistake, absolutely, they will be responsive
and work to resolve it,'' said Charlotte Birch, a spokeswoman for
the American Bankers Association. ``But if the customer authorized
it, the bank may not be in a position to retrieve the extra
payment, any more than if the customer wrote a second check for the
same bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, she appreciates the speed and convenience of
the system when it works properly, and her bank has made
improvements. She is now shown a summary of her latest online
payment session when she logs off, and she can print paper records
of all her transactions. ``Without a good paper trail, resolving an
electronic bill-paying dispute would be a nightmare,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Far from clear, though, is whether a consumer's home computer
printouts can ever match the probative power of a canceled check in
a court dispute or, worse, a tussle with the tax collector.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internal Revenue Service has no official position on
electronic transfers,'' a spokeswoman for the agency said, ``but
the burden of proof is still on the taxpayer to keep records and
show evidence that an invoice has been paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton is taking no chances. ``For charitable contributions or
other things where I might need a canceled check as proof of
payment, I write the check myself, just in case.''  &QL;

health and security, President Clinton declared HIV/AIDS a national
security threat. It stemmed from a declassified National
Intelligence Estimate coordinated by Gordon that explored the
implications of the spread of infectious disease for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon told the panel Thursday of an ``increasing possibility''
of a biological terrorist attack against the United States and that
the attack could be spread through an infectious disease. He also
addressed the potential impact on US troops abroad, saying that
those deployed to support humanitarian operations ``in developing
and former communist countries will be at highest risk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the developing world, nearly half of all deaths are
attributed to treatable infectious diseases. The National
Intelligence Estimate found that four of the ``deadly seven''
infectious diseases _ AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and hepatitis B
and C _ were ``either spreading or becoming more drug-resistant.''
The other three _ lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases
and measles _ appear to have ``at least temporarily peaked.''
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is passed through sex or dirty syringes, tuberculosis
through droplets often when coughing or sneezing, malaria through
the bite of a mosquito. Many others are transmitted through water
or food.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony given by Gordon and others Thursday, examples were
used again and again showing that national borders did nothing to
keep out infectious diseases. They cited several examples in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last's year outbreak in New York of West Nile virus, which was
carried by migratory birds, killed seven people. In the last six
months of 1999, 56 people in South Texas were found to have dengue
fever, a tropical disease. Also last year, two Boy Scouts acquired
malaria at a summer camp in rural New York. And just last Sunday, a
Rochester, N.Y., man died of bacterial meningitis on a flight from
Tel Aviv to New York; New York health authorities now are concerned
that others on the flight may have been infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot put a fence around America and hope to keep the
diseases out,'' said Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut,
the committee's ranking Democrat. ``We cannot stop Americans from
traveling overseas for business or vacation; we cannot stop
protecting our interests abroad and just keep our armed forces
locked in their barracks for fear of catching a deadly disease.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If this were a military invasion, it would be easier
to galvanize the public and policy makers. ... For humanitarian and
self-survival reasons, we need to face this challenge as if it were
an invading army.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, took the
thought another step, saying, ``Historians will wonder why in our
defense budget we spent so much defending ourselves from missiles,
and so little from diseases. Perhaps the NIH (National Institutes
of Health) will be the next Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has estimated that it would cost
$1.5 billion a year for the next decade for medicines and
prevention to stop the spread of the major infectious diseases.
Numerous bills in Congress propose trust funds to stem the spread
of diseases, including legislation passed by the House to spend
$500 million over five years for a World Bank AIDS fund.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon General David Satcher delivered a sobering statistical
look at AIDS, especially in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, which
has, he noted, ``5,500 funerals occurring each day in the region''
from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Due to AIDS, he said, demographers have projected that life
expectancy by the year 2010 will fall from 66 to 33 years in Zambia
and from 70 to 40 years in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, CIA analyst Gordon said that while AIDS was
the only disease formally named a national security threat, other
infectious diseases also posed a threat.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he said that US officials were closely watching
the spread of multi-drug resistant TB, especially in Russia and
other former Soviet states. ``Drug-resistant TB is going to be one
of the very large strategic problems in the next few years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He made the point that an outbreak far from home still will be
felt here.
</P>
<P>
   The worst infectious diseases are ``likely to slow economic
development and undermine the social structures in some
countries,'' posing major complications to US foreign policy, he
said. ``This will challenge democratic development and transitions,
and possibly contribute to humanitarian emergencies and military
conflicts to which the United States might expect to respond.''

ABORTION FOES TO CONTINUE PUSH FOR FEDERAL PARTIAL-BIRTH BAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wounded but unbowed by a blow from the US Supreme
Court, antiabortion leaders Thursday vowed to press on for a
federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortions, to insist the GOP
not waver on a human-life amendment in its platform, and to defeat
Al Gore in the presidential election in November.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Wednesday's ruling that struck down Nebraska's ban
on certain abortion procedures energized the activists to demand
that Texas Governor George W. Bush make abortion politics a more
prominent part of his presidential campaign _ a commitment he has
been trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Governor Bush is where he needs to be on
abortion, and we have a responsibility to get him there,'' said
Judie Brown, president of the American Life League, an antiabortion
advocacy group. Brown said her phones have been ``ringing off the
hook'' since the ruling. ``Our people want to know what it means,
why did it happen, and what can they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who opposes abortion rights and Wednesday pledged to fight
for a ban on what he called ``the brutal practice of partial-birth
abortion,'' has been criticized by social conservatives for
refusing to apply an antiabortion litmus test to his choice of a
running mate and any prospective nominees for the Supreme Court. To
prove he is a ``compassionate conservative'' and to woo women who
support the right to choose, Bush rarely brings up the abortion
issue as he campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has tried to be open and down the middle about abortion,
but now it is going to be much more diffcult to be in the middle,''
said Susan Cullman, who co-chairs the Republican Pro-Choice
Coalition. ``The Supreme Court decision will arouse the right wing
and encourage them to be stronger. That is good news for the
prochoice people, but it is not good news for our candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a consultant to Bush and a former executive director
of the Christian Coalition schooled in grass-roots abortion
politics, said he did not expect the Supreme Court's ruling to have
much impact on the centrist course of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Bush to remain true to his conservative
principles, but you win elections by talking about the issues on
which voters in the middle are turning, and that's education,
expanding the circle of prosperity, and Social Security,'' Reed
said. ``Those are the issues that will decide this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who supports abortion rights and frequently talks about it
in campaign speeches, praised the court's decision, while his
campaign delighted in the news that the high court was stirring up
passions over abortion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision brings the issue closer to home for more voters,
and by virtue of that, it will loom larger in our campaign,'' said
Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   There was no disagreement between advocates and foes on the
stakes in this election: The Supreme Court, which ruled 5-4 that
certain abortion procedures are unconstitutional, is more closely
divided than ever on the issue that continues to polarize the
country. With three of the justices at least 70 years old, the
probability is high that the next president will get one or more
nominees and the opportunity to tip the court's balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two candidates are absolutely and diametrically opposed
to each other on a woman's right to choose, it is our challenge to
repeat over and over again to American voters that the Supreme
Court is at risk,'' said Alice Germond, executive vice president of
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL officials have told Warren Christopher, the former
secretary of state who is leading Gore's search for a running mate,
that the choice of Indiana Senator Evan Bayh would be ``very
problematic'' because last year he voted in favor of legislation to
ban what opponents call partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a clear difference between Bush and Gore,
and to confuse that in any way would make it more difficult to
mobilize activists and voters,'' Germond said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, who opposed Bush in the GOP primaries, said Bush has
to learn from Democrats that you need to secure your core
supporters, in his case, conservatives, before veering to the
center. ``Prolife people are pretty depressed and are looking for
more reassurance that a Bush presidency would matter,'' Bauer said.
``In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, it would be a
political mistake for him to pick a prochoice running mate, water
down the GOP platform, or avoid the abortion issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauer and representatives of a number of conservative groups
were on Capitol Hill Thursday pressing the GOP to keep a strong
antiabortion plank in its platform. Others in the Capitol were
poring over the Supreme Court's ruling, trying to determine how a
partial-birth abortion bill that has passed the House and awaits
Senate action could be modified to pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawmakers are going to want to study the opinion carefully and
decide how to respond,'' Douglas Johnson, legislative director for
the National Right to Life Committee, said, predicting the bill
would pass and be sent to President Clinton, who has twice vetoed
similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of its ruling, the Supreme Court Thursday ordered
lower courts to review their decisions upholding bans on certain
abortion procedures in Illinois and Washington state. The court
also let stand a ruling that struck down Iowa's ban.

SAMPRAS TRIES TO HEAL AS WIMBLEDON SEARCHES FOR CALM 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ At least Pete Sampras was safe. With his
sore left shin packed like a champagne bottle in ice, he spent his
off day on the schedule healing in a villa well outside the
vine-covered walls of the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, chaos was exploding with the rapid-fire of popcorn. The
father of Jelena Dokic was hustled away by a policeman for unruly
behavior, Alexandra Stevenson was starting a firestorm after
accusing a fellow player of hurling a racial slur at her during a
recent tournament, and French Open champion Mary Pierce's powerful
game was short-circuiting during a surprise second-round exit.
</P>
<P>
   And on Centre Court, as the parting distress signal of the day,
Andre Agassi was throwing up his arms in anger when referee Alan
Mills waited until after he slipped on the buttery grass to suspend
his intense match with Mark Martin due to rain. On Friday, the
second-seeded Agassi will pick up his up match ahead two sets to
one, but down a break after the first game of the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you wait for a fall?'' an incredulous Agassi yelled at
Mills. ``It's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi gathered his things in a huff, and stalked out of the
court to end a frantic fourth day of Wimbledon. It began with
Sampras' latest malady. With his 28-year old body already as
tortured as a voodoo doll, the results of a magnetic resonance
imaging test he underwent Wednesday night after his second-round
win were unveiled Thursday: acute tendinitis in the lower left
shin.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded player will be in pain, but is expected to play
his third-round match against 99th-ranked Justin Gimelstob on
Friday. Over the next 10 days, if Sampras can grit his teeth
through his half of the draw _ which is light on danger with only
No. 9 Thomas Enqvist remaining as a seeded player _ he will still
have his shot at breaking Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is resilient, so it's a matter of doing the best he can,''
said Sampras' coach Paul Annacone, who has watched Sampras endure
back and leg problems throughout the last couple of years. ``He
could sit around and say, `Why me? Why has it been like this
lately?' You just try to figure out what happened, and try to deal
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he plays here, and he feels well, I think historically,
we've seen what happens. So it's a matter of trying to do it
another way.''
</P>
<P>
   As a six-time winner at Wimbledon, Sampras will press on, using
his serve as a peg leg to stand on. Sampras still has his trusty
howitzer. But Thursday proved that power players are vulnerable.
With her grounds trokes spraying the grass well outside the lines,
the third-seeded Pierce could not find enough control on the big
points to hold off 49th-ranked Magui Serna, losing 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4)
in her attempt at an encore to her French Open title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be,'' said Pierce, who came cruising into
Wimbledon with a 25-9 record this year. ``She played well, served
great. There were a few chances _ not very many _ in the first set
and the second set. It was just close. It just wasn't there all
together for me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of sorts, Lindsay Davenport could sympathize. Still trying
to find the compass to her swift strokes after a six-week absence
with a back injury in the spring, she gamely groped for a way to
finally slip by Elena Likhovtseva 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. It was a delicate
drop-shot, of all weapons, that turned what looked like an upset
into a relief. Down 0-3 in the third set, Likhovtseva was serving
for the game when Davenport slipped in a drop shot. From there,
Davenport ran off six straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough when you have injuries,'' Davenport said.
``I was on such a roll before that I wasn't ... you don't really
think about things when you're playing well. All of a sudden when I
was out for almost two months, your tennis just starts to hurt a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding the upset, Davenport ducked the mayhem Thursday.
After a boisterous romp around the grounds, Damir Dokic celebrated
his daughter Jelena's second-round win by popping off in the press
center and breaking the cell phone of a reporter. Two hours later,
Stevenson's attempt to re-create her trip fantastic through
Wimbledon last year _ during which she became the first woman
qualifier to land in the semifinals _ ended with a 7-6 (6), 6-3
loss to Patricia Wartusch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is my rookie year is over,'' said Stevenson,
whose biological father was also disclosed to be Julius Erving at
Wimbledon last year. ``There was a lot of hazing going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said one incident occurred at a tournament last month
when a French player, Amelie Cocheteux, profanely referred to her
with a racial slur on the court. When questioned about the
accusation by a French reporter, Cocheteux denied making such a
remark.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, there were more barbs ricocheting around the
grounds than volleys. Out of harm's way, Sampras was recovering
quietly, icing his shin and taking anti-inflammatory drugs. In his
absence, Annacone was left to confront the prickly issues
concerning Sampras' increasing fragility. The question of toughness
was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subjective thing,'' Annacone said. ``I can tell you my
body feels awful 90 percent of the time when I wake up in the
morning. I played 10 years on the tour. I've had a herniated disk
in my back. I've got all kinds of things. I don't know what he
physically feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``But compared to certain people, his tolerance is very high.
Probably compared to a football player, they're saying, `What's the
big deal?' I think everything is relative, but unfortunately for
people like Pete, I think things like that tend to make a lot of
news. But yeah, if you give me five minutes, I could probably argue
both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a strong return by Sampras could help bring peace to
the argument _ and, perhaps, to the grounds of Wimbledon.

AFTER 3,000-MILE JOURNEY, CAT'S NUMBER JUST WASN'T UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Colo.; i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Perhaps it was tragedy that caused Lapis to roam.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the black-and-white cat vanished from her home in
Boulder, Colo., Lapis's brother, Hoki, had been put down by a
veterinarian's needle because of an incurable kidney ailment. That
was April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the sweet-natured shorthair on top of the
other cat's death was devastating to owner Jennifer Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried and cried. I loved her so much,'' said Hill, 33, a
graduate student of social work at the University of Denver. ``I
posted signs, I placed ads, I called the animal shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs yielded nothing but false leads, ditto the
classifieds. Animal shelter workers could offer only sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   But this kitty's tale has a happy ending.
</P>
<P>
   Lapis the cat is back purring on the lap of her owner, returned
earlier this week after an epic feline journey of nearly 3,000
miles to Canada's Far North _ all the way to Champagne Landing,
Yukon Territory, pop. 15, located nearer the Arctic Circle than the
United States border.
</P>
<P>
   How the pink-nosed wayfarer could wander so far is a mystery.
The best guess is she hopped into the back of a truck or camper,
and either leaped to freedom during a pit stop near Champagne
Landing _ or was pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the discovery of Lapis is the biggest thing to happen
around Champagne Landing since the Alaska Highway was built through
in 1942. The former gold rush trading post and Indian burial site
hasn't lately even rated a place on the map _ it's too tiny to
qualify as a hamlet by Canadian government definition, so most
cartographers don't bother with it.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everyone noticed the five-pound furry stranger who
sashayed into the settlement last month, while Hill was still
futilely seeking kitty far, far to the south.
</P>
<P>
   There was Edward Chambers, 65, whose mutt, B.V., chased the
newcomer up a tree. ``Dog wouldn't stop barking, but I thought
nothing of it,'' said the retired businessman. ``Sure I figured the
cat was from away _ Whitehorse, maybe. Not the other side of the
Rockies.''
</P>
<P>
   A week or so later, the errant cat was spied again rooting after
field mice near the home of Chambers' mother-in-law. Then spotted
prowling the Indian burial ground. Chambers' son-in-law, David
Grant, remarked that it seemed odd a stray cat should have such a
pretty blue collar. Odder still that it hadn't been gobbled by
coyotes, wolves or other predators that make a cat's life in the
wild country a perilous one. Finally Grant's niece, Susan, checked
out the tag _ puzzling at the phone number with the unfamiliar area
code.
</P>
<P>
   Grant called Hill. The Colorado woman was incredulous,
wondering, just for starters, where the heck the Yukon was? But she
was delighted to learn that her runaway appeared to be faring just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``She survived up there because she's a real good mouser,'' Hill
said. ``She may be a little kitty, but she's tough and
resourceful.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughie's trials and travels weren't over. Grant drove the
cat to Whitehorse, the territorial capital, buying a cat cage at
the Canadian Tire store and trying to check her aboard the most
direct flight south. But because of a heat wave in Colorado, the
airline refused to carry an unaccompanied cat to Denver
International.
</P>
<P>
   So Lapis was flown to Hill's sister, Elizabeth, in San
Francisco. From where Hill retrieved her on Wednesday, 70 days
after the cat went missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she got home, she ate a can of tuna, then played with her
toys,'' Hill said. ``Then went to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Lapis, for shuteye is something that Hill and the folk in
Champagne Landing are finding hard to come by these days, as the
phones ring and ring from media around the world. BBC calling.
People Magazine here. Australian radio on the line, mate. The New
York Post. Fox Network. Everyone loves a cat yarn.
</P>
<P>
   But is there a moral to it all? Any deeper lesson for us all?
</P>
<P>
   You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always put your cat's number on the collar,'' Hill advised.
``Because you just never know where she'll turn up.''

 &HT;    S.C. pulling plug on video poker
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Across a red-topped table cluttered by
cigarette packs and coffee-stained spoons, Eddie Lewis and four of
his friends were saying good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   Not to each other, but to the five Pot O Gold video poker
machines hugging the wall. As of midnight tonight, more than 22,000
machines will be outlawed in South Carolina in one of the largest
shutdowns of legalized gambling in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of South Carolina's once-powerful gambling industry
has unfolded so quickly that Lewis can't quite believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seems like a dream,'' said the 53-year-old masseur, who
is going to miss gathering for dinner at Jackies Restaurant on
Wednesday and spending a few bucks on Superball Keno, Aces High and
other games. ``It's hard to believe they'll be unplugged.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands already have been disconnected, loaded on trucks and
shipped to warehouses in Georgia, North Carolina and other states
that allow some forms of video poker.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians might get another chance to gamble in the near
future if Gov. Jim Hodges succeeds in his push for a statewide
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But lottery fever might be on the wane in the South. A
referendum backed by Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, who, like Hodges,
rode the lottery promise to victory in 1998, was soundly defeated
by voters last year.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, video poker operators seem unwilling to
challenge state Attorney General Charlie Condon, who vowed police
would confiscate machines still in the state after midnight and
likened illegal machines to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Operators fleeing South Carolina aren't likely to find Georgia
to be as profitable for video poker. Georgia law prevents
convenience stores, bars and other establishments where some 45,500
machines are located from paying game winners in cash, said Charles
Willey, spokesman for the Georgia Department of Revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Winnings are limited to free replays or merchandise prizes, such
as toys or novelties, with a wholesale value of less than $5,
according to Georgia law.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, South Carolina's loosely regulated industry
flourished over the past decade. The number of state-licensed
machines, which dispense tickets that are redeemed for cash, peaked
last year at nearly 37,000. They were collecting bets at an annual
rate of $3.3 billion in every corner of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The state's image suffered as industry opponents portrayed
operators as preying on poor people willing to spend paychecks on
the chance of hitting it big.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to curb the industry, the Legislature voted last year to
end video gambling July 1 unless voters in a referendum in November
1999 decided to keep the machines legal and enact new regulations.
A month before the vote, the state Supreme Court ruled the
referendum was unconstitutional but left the ban in place.
</P>
<P>
   Defending themselves against charges that they flaunted state
regulations, operators countered _ as they still do _ that adults
have a right to play legal games. Besides, they said, the industry
employs about 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only legitimate complaint against video poker is it hurts
some people,'' said Warren Holliday, owner of Holliday Amusement
Co. in Charleston. ``But for every person it hurts, hundreds of
others are helped.''
</P>
<P>
   In video poker's final hours, industry officials predicted that
mom-and-pop stores that depend on gaming revenues will go out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn will leave buildings unoccupied and hard to rent,
they said. Canadian Donald Frenette rented a closed laundry mat in
downtown Charleston 3 1/2 years ago and installed five video
gambling machines in an establishment he named Club Sante.
</P>
<P>
   As he was preparing Thursday to move the machines and close the
business, he said each of his machines netted a profit of more than
$400 a week. Now he faces a monthly rent of $6,300, with no revenue
coming in.
</P>
<P>
   Frenette, 39, asked, hopefully, ``Is my lease void since this
business is now illegal? This is a question everybody is going to
be asking. How do we pay our rent?'' Holliday said he figured state
legislators would give the industry ``three or four years'' to wind
down their businesses so they could repay debts from the industry's
rapid expansion in recent years.
</P>

   ``We were absolutely double-crossed,'' said Holliday, whose
family business started in 1933 renting pool tables and jukeboxes.
It now counts on video poker for 93 percent of its revenues. ``They
have destroyed my business.''

HAVANA HOPES TO BUILD UPON ELIAN AFFAIR TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CUBA-LOBBY, CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ ``At Last in the Fatherland!'' declared the front-page
headline in the official newspaper Granma, above pictures of Elian
Gonzalez stepping off the plane and being swept up in a relative's
arms, an emotional end to the seven-month custody battle that
captivated this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the triumphal headline, the newspaper quickly reminded
readers that the child's return was just the beginning of renewed
efforts by Cuban officials who want to see an end to the U.S. trade
embargo. They contend that the embargo and other U.S. policies
weaken their economy and encourage people, like Elian's mother, to
risk their lives at sea while seeking political asylum elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, the government plans to continue the public
rallies and televised discussions that provided a daily political
play-by-play during the Elian custody battle, including a rally
this Saturday in Manzanillo, where 200,000 people are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign officials based here see the continuing campaign as an
attempt to tap into the Cuban public's overwhelming support for
Elian's return in the hope of rekindling a revolutionary ardor that
had cooled in recent years, especially among young Cubans who were
not yet born during the Cuban revolution. They said the battle over
Elian was the perfect issue and opportunity for President Fidel
Castro to restore his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got himself front and center before the country on a daily
basis,'' said one foreign official. ``He re-established himself in
his image as the sole leader in Cuba who still has the oomph and
fire to carry on the revolution. He got an issue he could mobilize
the youth, who are his audience and a group that he had not had
effective outreach to before.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether, or how, the Cuban leader will be able
to sustain his new appeal in the coming months. Some people said
they had tired of the government-sponsored rallies for Elian that
took them away from work and home. Many said they simply wanted the
boy home with his family. And other Cubans said they would now like
to see something else on television besides the hours-long talks
about the ills of American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is politics,'' said Maria Gonzalez, who was shopping
at a Havana market. ``Human feelings should not be mixed up with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Thursday's Cuban newspapers were filled not only with praise
for Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but also for the
many youths and students who attended the countless public rallies
organized by the government. While insisting the government would
not trot out the child as a symbol, the official newspaper made
clear Elian's importance to a battle that it said must continue
``immediately and without a truce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to enjoy internally the conquest of reuniting the boy
with his family,'' one article said. ``Ahead of us is the challenge
that no new Elians continue to appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the huge billboards with Elian's face have been
replaced by others that call for the United States to end its Cuban
Adjustment Act, which grants political asylum to Cubans who reach
U.S. soil. But while the emotional custody battle strongly affected
many Cubans, these more abstract policy issues now being tackled by
the Cuban government may not have the same resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elian's story was so visual, with this child and his father,''
said one foreign official. ``Can you keep that up with the Cuban
Adjustment Act without any such visuals? It will be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's case was a godsend for the Cuban government, which had
spent much of 1999 stepping away from the openings of previous
years and taking a harder line to restore public order and to crack
down on dissidents. During a summit meeting of Spanish-speaking
nations last November, Cuban officials cringed when many visiting
dignitaries went out of their way to visit several dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In November, we were with a government on the defensive and
looking for a way to get out,'' said one diplomat. ``A few days
after the summit comes this news this child had been found in the
sea. Immediately, Fidel Castro went after it as a humanitarian and
strong story. He managed it very well and allowed him for seven
months to mobilize all the people for Elian's return.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked better than past attempts to rally the
public behind issues like a court case seeking billions of dollars
in reparations from the United States for the ill effects of the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer Elian stayed away, the more united the people
became,'' said Roberto Perez Martinez as he shared a beer with some
friends. ``It united people who even once had doubts about the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, diplomats said, the Cuban government has
scored some points through its campaign for Elian's return. They
pointed to the easing of restrictions on U.S. food sales passed
this week by Congress. They said that decision was a result of a
growing sentiment against the embargo in the United States among
people who favored Elian's return and who were turned off by the
hardball tactics of Elian's Miami relatives and their supporters
who sought to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They noticed it was not just about a regime, but there were
real people living in Cuba,'' one diplomat said. ``A lot of people
in the United States questioned the embargo, and Elian helped with
that sentiment.''

CONGRESS REQUIRES DISCLOSURE BY SECRETIVE ADVOCACY GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE and JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking its first significant step after 21 years of
futility, Congress Thursday approved legislation requiring greater
disclosure by secretive groups that are spending millions of
dollars to influence elections nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, approved by the Senate 92-6, now goes to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect he'll sign the legislation when it comes down to
him,'' said Joe Lockhart, Clinton's spokesman. ``The public has a
right to know who groups like this are, who funds them. This is a
step in the right direction as far as campaign finance reform, but
we have a lot more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the House Tuesday, would affect a single
class of tax-exempt groups that, while small in number, are having
an increasing impact on elections nationwide. These groups have
exploited part of the tax code, Section 527, allowing them to raise
and spend an unlimited amount of money without reporting anything
about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, these Section 527 groups would be required to
report their donors and expenditures to the Internal Revenue
Service in return for keeping their tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Though the groups are generally not aligned with any specific
candidate, their money has been used to underwrite advertisements,
conduct polls, and launch voter registration drives in hopes of
influencing elections. Yet unlike spending by other tax-exempt
groups that are required to disclose where their money comes from,
527 organizations leave ``no fingerprints'' as to who is donating
and what their motivation is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action is based on the principle of openness and
letting the people know who is behind the flurry of anonymous
campaign ads,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who voted for the
bill. ``The American people should know the true source of groups
seeking to influence our elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who also voted for the bill, said
she has been alarmed by ``a huge proliferation'' of such groups in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``issue advocacy'' ads already have gained prominence
in Washington state, months ahead of the primary and general
elections.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance industry-backed group called Americans for Job
Security has praised Gorton's education proposals in ads on Western
Washington TV stations, while Eastern Washington stations have run
ads extolling Gorton's promise to block any plan to breach Snake
River Dams.
</P>
<P>
   A front group for the nation's drug makers, Citizens for Better
Medicare, has blanketed the airwaves with a TV spot showing elderly
Canadians (played by actors) being bused into the United States for
surgery. The ad warns against ``Canadian-style price controls.''
</P>
<P>
   But the earliest, most intense campaign has been waged by U.S.
Term Limits against Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., for reneging
on his 1994 pledge to serve only three terms in Congress. It has
run TV and radio spots, erected billboards, bought bus signs and
even fielded an animal-costumed demonstrator, dubbed ``The Weasel
King,'' to harass Nethercutt as he seeks a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of 527 groups gained national attention earlier
this year when a pair of Texas brothers ran $2.5 million in ads
praising Texas Gov. George W. Bush and attacking Sen. John McCain
in the days before a crucial GOP primary election.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oldest 527s is the Sierra Club, which is running an
$8 million campaign boosting Democrats running for Congress and
attacking Bush's record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Arizona Republican who sponsored the bill and who
has made campaign reform his signature issue, said passing it would
help restore public faith in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today indeed marks a seminal day in our battle to reform our
electoral system and restore the faith of the American citizenry
that ours is a government of and for the people,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The praise wasn't universal, however.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was one of a handful of senators to
vote against the disclosure bill.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested groups affected by the bill will either disband or
fight the measure in court.
</P>
<P>
   The other five senators who voted against the bill also are
Republicans. They are Paul Coverdale of Georgia, Jesse Helms of
North Carolina, Jame Inhofe of Oklahoma, Connie Mack of Florida,
and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.

EXIT, ALEXANDRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Barbara Walters asked her about her first kiss. Anybody
with a TV set heard interviewers grill her about her mystery dad,
who turned out to be none other than Dr. J, a person of some
athletic ability himself: Julius Erving, a resident of basketball's
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   She was The Story of Wimbledon 1999: Alexandra Winfield
Stevenson, a California teenager who set a record at the oldest
tennis tournament by scurrying to the semifinals as a back-door
entry, a qualifier ranked No. 88.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Alexandra was merely the sorry loser to a woman as
much of a nobody as she had been a year ago. An Austrian named
Patricia Wartusch, rated No. 74, beat Stevenson handily in the
second round, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, concluding with an ace, the stroke
that had been Alexandra's signature only 12 months before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very saddened by my early exit, but the good thing is my
rookie year is over,'' said Stevenson, ever poised. Headed to UCLA
on a tennis scholarship when her flame ignited at the Big W, she
quickly declared herself a pro to collect $145,026 in prize money,
and was pointed in a different direction _ ``a year I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   She left this year's tournament not with a bang or a whimper,
but by throwing a brick (and not the kind her father occasionally
launched). It was aimed at the women's tour and the ``hazing'' she
says she had received during the year by ``girls who didn't
appreciate the big splash I made last year. Because I've gotten a
lot of attention, and I have a personality, they don't like it.
That's too bad. That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   She singled out the French, particularly Amelie Cocheteux, whom
she beat by rebounding from the brink of defeat at Strasbourg.
Cocheteux called her ``a piece of black (expletive),'' said
Alexandra, who has a black father and white mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She invented it; I never went near her,'' the 22-year-old
Cocheteux answered to the charge that she shouldered Stevenson in
the locker room. ``Her mother was coaching her from the sidelines,
which is against the rules, but the umpire did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whom can you believe?
</P>
<P>
   A respected French journalist said, ``I don't know who started
it but there's bad blood between our girls and Alexandra and her
mother (Samantha Stevenson).''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, it's been a rocky 12 months for
19-year-old Alexandra, whose vivacious personality does leave most
of her contemporaries seeming withdrawn and vacuous. Even so, she's
a shaky 8-22 since Wimbledon last, a tournament in which she won
eight matches (including qualifying).
</P>
<P>
   She considers herself an actress, ``an entertainer'' on court,
smiling and curtsying to the crowd. Some call it gracious; others
call it hotdogging. Andre Agassi gets away with it because he's won
six major titles, and . . . well . . . he's Andre, who has worn
nail polish and has had more hairstyles than Charlie's Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Well-schooled by her single-parenting mom, a former TV and
newspaper journalist, Alexandra gives good press conference,
actually in English, a subject that so many of the ill-educated
child pros flunk. Mummy is a shrewd strategist. Bad match, good
quotes, much publicity regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra says she thinks of herself as a variety of characters
and actresses _ Julia Roberts when she won her first-rounder. Maybe
it was Ma Kettle Thursday. She's had a rough time maintaining what
she achieved here. Her ranking rose to No. 36 post-Wimbledon,
skidded to No. 46 as she played this brief encore, and plummeted to
No. 95 since she couldn't cover the Wimbledon points she made last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It's back to the bushes, qualifying tourneys again. Few have
risen so high from nowhere or done a canyon dive so deep in the
space of 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at 6 feet 1 inch with an attractive
serve-and-volley style, she remains a potent prospect, bright and
coachable with plenty of room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Alexandra said, ``I learned that you really have to be
tough out here. I came out (a year ago) as kind of a Southern
California clueless girl. I was used to high school and people
being nice to you. But out here it's a job, your profession. You
don't make friends . . . you can get eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other people don't want you to succeed, so you stay within
your inner circle and pray a lot to God. Take a lot of confidence
from the small group around you, be tough, keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra and Samantha are the core of the small group. Though
Samantha could be called a stage _ or court? _ mother, her kid is a
lot better off emotionally than Jelena Dokic, the 17-year-old
Aussie whiz Alexandra beat in the quarters last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Damir Dokic, the latest member of the tennis Bad
Dads Club, embarrassed his talented daughter again Thursday with
another disorderly performance, this time trying to assault a TV
news reporter. Cops cooled him out. Papa Dokic isn't likely to be
summoned by Barbara Walters, and it may be a while for Alexandra,
who has kissed Wimbledon goodbye for this year.

COMMENTARY: A SHOT IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's take one more opportunity to pat ourselves on the back for
mapping the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important events in the history of mankind,''
said Al Gore, a person who we all know is not given to
overstatement.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who are scientifically illiterate, the precise
meaning of the genome research project is a tad murky. But the
verbiage floating around _ ``eradicate once incurable diseases''
(Bill Clinton) or ``a limitless progression of new medical
breakthroughs'' (Gore) _ seems to suggest that our biotech guys are
six months away from curing death.
</P>
<P>
   We are, you know, one heck of a canny species. It's particularly
impressive the way we manage to balance things out, matching
scientific triumphs on one front with brand-new megathreats on
another.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, as the genome-mappers were racing to the
finish line, the World Health Organization called a press
conference to announce that, due to the misuse of antibiotics,
diseases like tuberculosis and malaria are threatening to run amok.
Gonorrhea, it warned, has become almost completely resistant to
penicillin and has turned into ``a potentially life-threatening
contagion.''
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture? We're going to use the genome map to slow down
the aging process so the next generation has the opportunity to
live to be 150. Unfortunately, all the diseases we thought were
wiped out decades ago will come back in new supercharged form, so
everybody succumbs to dysentery at 23.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that when bacteria get exposed to
less-than-overwhelming amounts of antibiotics, evolution goes into
overdrive. The weaker germs die off, and the strongest reproduce
themselves into new, drug-resistant forms. This happens in
underdeveloped countries when poor people try to stretch their
allocation of medicine by taking less than the prescribed dosage.
It may be happening in the United States because doctors are
overprescribing antibiotics for minor ailments and the livestock
industry puts them in feed to make the animals grow faster.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these problems are extremely complicated. But it does
seem as if cutting off the antibiotics in the chicken feed might be
a simple first step. Thursday in Washington, a handful of
legislators tried to amend the Department of Agriculture's budget
to make it easier to do just that. Even the sponsors had no hope
for success. ``Antibiotics is an issue Congress is just beginning
to find out about,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting around for his colleagues to debate a $200,000 grant for
research on ``international asparagus competitiveness'' (it won),
Brown predicted it would take about five years for the House to
really grasp the idea that the antibiotics thing is a serious
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats take back the House, I'd be the chairman of
the Health Subcommittee, and we'd do hearings,'' he vowed. Truly,
Brown has learned the ways of the congressional timetable. On the
one hand, we have our medical shield against virulent disease
collapsing. On the other hand, we have: (1) elections and (2)
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The livestock industry has done some amazing things over the
last decade or so. Animals are now raised in huge warehouses where
they're kept virtually immobile. Their waste gets dumped into lakes
of excrement known as ``lagoons,'' which have been known to leak or
flood into the neighborhood groundwater. You have cows bred to give
so much milk they practically topple over if left to stand under
their own power. There are pigs whose feet never touch the ground.
To keep disease from breaking out when they're crammed in unnatural
conditions, the creatures are frequently shot full of antibiotics,
beyond what they're getting in their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The rigors of political campaigns require that candidates defend
these and all other practices popular with the farm lobby as part
of ``a vanishing way of life.'' Neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush
actually appears to have a position on the antibiotics controversy
_ we're still waiting for Bush to make a statement about the genome
map. He's avoided the subject since last January, when he
announced, ``I worry about people taking the place of God.''

PEDRO MARTINEZ PLACED ON DISABLED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Pedro Martinez won't pitch Saturday in Chicago, won't
pitch five days later in Minnesota, and exactly what day he will
return to the Red Sox roster after the July 10-12 All-Star break
remains in question.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner,
was informed Thursday that he had been placed on the 15-day
disabled list, retroactive to his last start, June 25 in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The decision clearly did not sit well with the 28-year-old
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say,'' he said, quickly dismissing
reporters clustered around his locker not long before the Sox took
the field against Baltimore, looking to break a five-game losing
streak. ``I did what I could to pitch. I was tight last time. This
time, I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does it all mean? Why are the Red Sox shelving the best
pitcher in the AL when the best pitcher in the AL says he is able
and ready to pitch as soon as Saturday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Sox skipper Jimy Williams, it comes down to his
opinion that Martinez is not physically able to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a couple of little medical things that we're going to
take care of,'' said Williams. The manager would not provide more
specific information regarding the ``medical things'', other than
to make reference to the history of problems Martinez has had with
an oblique muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at it as (going) on the 15-day disabled list
that take care of the little glitches he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Martinez, who shagged fly balls and tossed in the
outfield after being placed on the DL, would not accompany the club
to Chicago for the upcoming three-game series against the White
Sox. According to the manager, the ace will be treated by the
club's medical staff over the weekend, then meet up with the club
next week in Minnesota. The Sox open a four-game series with the
Twins Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to go on (the disabled list),'' said Williams.
``I accept that. It's my decision. It's my responsibility. I think
it's the right thing to do, and he doesn't. That's all right.''
</P>
<P>
   It began to become obvious that management would direct Martinez
toward a fortnight of rest and relaxation Tuesday night, when Sox
general manager Dan Duquette said during a pregame radio show that
such a move could be imminent. Duquette added Wednesday night that
Martinez was ``tight'' prior to making his last start, against the
Blue Jays, and the tightness also lingered after the start.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was obviously working in concert with the GM when he
met with Martinez in the clubhouse not longer after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for me is that I'm just trying to protect the
assets of the Red Sox,'' Williams said. ``I want the kid to be able
to pitch for a lot of years here. If I didn't put him on, to be
honest, and he went out and did something severe, it would be
difficult to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams likewise would not provide details regarding what
course of action the club's medical staff would take with Martinez.
He emphasized however, that Martinez would be ``checked out by the
organization'' _ a clear reference that the righthander wouldn't be
expected to go looking for outside second and third opinions about
the need for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take care of it,'' said Williams, raising his right arm
as if lifting his hand to answer a question in a school room, ``in
the fashion we think is the best way to handle it. And he will join
us in Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox return to action after the All-Star break when the Mets
come to Fenway July 13, the start of a three-game series. Martinez
would be available to return at that point, provided his medical
``glitches'' have been remedied.
</P>
<P>
   Williams's best pitcher is hurting, and by the sounds of it, he
is hurting in more than one place. The scenario is reminiscent of
the '99 postseason when Martinez exited Game 1 of the AL Division
Series against Cleveland with what was diagnosed as a back strain.
Martinez returned in Game 5 and pitched six innings of brilliant
no-hit relief. Williams now wants the pain to go away, and feels he
has no option other than to send pitcher and pain to the sideline
for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my decision,'' emphasized Martinez. ``It was
(Williams's) decision _ the GM's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He can handle a lot of pain,'' said Williams. ``Now, there's
pain and there's injury. We are trying to prevent injury. When you
have pain, your body is trying to tell you something. Now, will
that pain go away? I don't know.''

EXIT, ALEXANDRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Barbara Walters asked her about her first kiss. Anybody
with a TV set heard interviewers grill her about her mystery dad,
who turned out to be none other than Dr. J, a person of some
athletic ability himself: Julius Erving, a resident of basketball's
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   She was The Story of Wimbledon 1999: Alexandra Winfield
Stevenson, a California teenager who set a record at the oldest
tennis tournament by scurrying to the semifinals as a back-door
entry, a qualifier ranked No. 88.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Alexandra was merely the sorry loser to a woman as
much of a nobody as she had been a year ago. An Austrian named
Patricia Wartusch, rated No. 74, beat Stevenson handily in the
second round, 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, concluding with an ace, the stroke
that had been Alexandra's signature only 12 months before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very saddened by my early exit, but the good thing is my
rookie year is over,'' said Stevenson, ever poised. Headed to UCLA
on a tennis scholarship when her flame ignited at the Big W, she
quickly declared herself a pro to collect $145,026 in prize money,
and was pointed in a different direction _ ``a year I wouldn't wish
on my worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   She left this year's tournament not with a bang or a whimper,
but by throwing a brick (and not the kind her father occasionally
launched). It was aimed at the women's tour and the ``hazing'' she
says she had received during the year by ``girls who didn't
appreciate the big splash I made last year. Because I've gotten a
lot of attention, and I have a personality, they don't like it.
That's too bad. That's me.''
</P>
<P>
   She singled out the French, particularly Amelie Cocheteux, whom
she beat by rebounding from the brink of defeat at Strasbourg.
Cocheteux called her ``a piece of black (expletive),'' said
Alexandra, who has a black father and white mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She invented it; I never went near her,'' the 22-year-old
Cocheteux answered to the charge that she shouldered Stevenson in
the locker room. ``Her mother was coaching her from the sidelines,
which is against the rules, but the umpire did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whom can you believe?
</P>
<P>
   A respected French journalist said, ``I don't know who started
it but there's bad blood between our girls and Alexandra and her
mother (Samantha Stevenson).''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, it's been a rocky 12 months for
19-year-old Alexandra, whose vivacious personality does leave most
of her contemporaries seeming withdrawn and vacuous. Even so, she's
a shaky 8-22 since Wimbledon last, a tournament in which she won
eight matches (including qualifying).
</P>
<P>
   She considers herself an actress, ``an entertainer'' on court,
smiling and curtsying to the crowd. Some call it gracious; others
call it hotdogging. Andre Agassi gets away with it because he's won
six major titles, and . . . well . . . he's Andre, who has worn
nail polish and has had more hairstyles than Charlie's Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Well-schooled by her single-parenting mom, a former TV and
newspaper journalist, Alexandra gives good press conference,
actually in English, a subject that so many of the ill-educated
child pros flunk. Mummy is a shrewd strategist. Bad match, good
quotes, much publicity regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra says she thinks of herself as a variety of characters
and actresses _ Julia Roberts when she won her first-rounder. Maybe
it was Ma Kettle Thursday. She's had a rough time maintaining what
she achieved here. Her ranking rose to No. 36 post-Wimbledon,
skidded to No. 46 as she played this brief encore, and plummeted to
No. 95 since she couldn't cover the Wimbledon points she made last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It's back to the bushes, qualifying tourneys again. Few have
risen so high from nowhere or done a canyon dive so deep in the
space of 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at 6 feet 1 inch with an attractive
serve-and-volley style, she remains a potent prospect, bright and
coachable with plenty of room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Alexandra said, ``I learned that you really have to be
tough out here. I came out (a year ago) as kind of a Southern
California clueless girl. I was used to high school and people
being nice to you. But out here it's a job, your profession. You
don't make friends . . . you can get eaten alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other people don't want you to succeed, so you stay within
your inner circle and pray a lot to God. Take a lot of confidence
from the small group around you, be tough, keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra and Samantha are the core of the small group. Though
Samantha could be called a stage _ or court? _ mother, her kid is a
lot better off emotionally than Jelena Dokic, the 17-year-old
Aussie whiz Alexandra beat in the quarters last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Damir Dokic, the latest member of the tennis Bad
Dads Club, embarrassed his talented daughter again Thursday with
another disorderly performance, this time trying to assault a TV
news reporter. Cops cooled him out. Papa Dokic isn't likely to be
summoned by Barbara Walters, and it may be a while for Alexandra,
who has kissed Wimbledon goodbye for this year.

BUSH'S RELATIONSHIP WITH GIANT ENERGY COMPANY IS MUTUALLY
BENEFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In October 1997, George W. Bush placed a call to his
friend Tom Ridge, the Republican governor of Pennsylvania, to vouch
for Enron Corp., the giant Houston energy and trading company that,
at the time, was battling to sell electricity in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made the call at the request of Kenneth L. Lay, the
chairman and chief executive of Enron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called George W. to kind of tell him what was going on,''
Lay said. ``And I said that it would be very helpful to Enron,
which is obviously a large company in the state of Texas, if he
could just call the governor and tell him this is a serious
company, this is a professional company, a good company.''
</P>
<P>
   After a nasty regulatory fight, Enron cracked into
Pennsylvania's market. And in the ensuing years, the Texas energy
company, along with the Texas governor who has supported it, has
seen its influence widen nationally and internationally. Along the
way, Enron and its executives have been Bush's most generous
contributors, giving more to his various campaigns _ over $550,000
_ than any other source.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Bush and Lay is close, and old: the two
men got to know each other in the 1980s, when Lay was a big
political supporter of Bush's father, former President George Bush.
It is the sort of friendship where the governor takes the time to
write a joshing birthday note to Lay: ``One of the sad things about
old friends is that they seem to be getting older _ just like you!
55 years old. Wow! That is really old.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 53, listens closely to what Lay, now 58, and others at
Enron have to say about important policy matters. As governor, Bush
has been a supporter of the most significant legislative
initiatives of Enron, including deregulating electric utilities,
easing the tax burden on capital-intensive companies, and passing
laws meant to curb large jury awards in civil cases. On all of
them, Bush received advice from top Enron executives, sometimes
soliciting it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues important to Enron, particularly tort reform,
were also important to other Texas businesses. And Bush, a
spokesman said, has gone to bat for other companies, too, never
making unusual overtures for Enron or pushing for legislation
specifically tailored to benefit the company.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Enron lobbies on an even wider array of issues,
including federal regulation of the nation's electric-power grid
(Enron wants rules making it easier to trade and transmit
electricity); support for the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a
federal agency that finances and insures many of Enron's overseas
projects; free trade around the globe, which helps Enron's
far-flung energy businesses; and limiting the regulation of
derivatives transactions between private parties, a huge and
growing part of Enron's business.
</P>
<P>
   Enron lobbies on so many issues in Congress that it takes 26
pages for it to list them all on federal disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Smith, director of the Texas office of Public Citizen, the
group founded by Ralph Nader, who is himself a presidential
candidate, said: ``Enron's investment in the Bush gubernatorial
campaigns have paid off in policies beneficial to them. And that's
why they're investing so heavily in the presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides say it is not unusual for Bush to lend his name to a Texas
company's efforts outside the state, as he did for Enron in
Pennsylvania. In the past, for example, he has contacted foreign
leaders considering whether to buy military aircraft from Texas
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Enron officials reject the notion that their donations are meant
to influence legislation, and they note that, in aggregate, their
most significant legislative opponents, electric utilities, give
far more money to federal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I make contributions to a candidate, it is not for some
special favor, it's not even for access _ although I'll be the
first to admit it probably helps access,'' Lay said in an interview
at Enron's 50-story headquarters in downtown Houston. ``It is
because I'm supporting candidates I strongly believe in
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Lay added, ``I'm not doing this now because I want to be an
ambassador or cabinet officer or want any specific thing done if he
gets elected.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Enron does not seek legislation that benefits only
the company. ``When we go in and lobby for things like Nafta, or
like WTO status for China, or electric deregulation, we're
basically doing it because we think it's right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential race alone, Enron and its executives have
given Bush about $100,000, making Enron the 11th largest donor to
the Bush campaign so far, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. And that does not include the unlimited donations to the
Republican Party, known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Lay has donated $326,000 to Republican Party committees over the
past three years _ including $250,000 in April. (Enron has also
contributed soft money to Democrats, and Lay has golfed with
President Clinton). Lay's second-in-command, Jeffrey Skilling, has
donated another $100,000 to the Republicans, according to Federal
Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Lay is also one of the ``Pioneers,'' Bush supporters who pledge
to collect at least $100,000 in direct contributions. As part of
that role, he sent a letter last year to several hundred people,
many of them Enron executives, urging them to make the maximum
contribution to Bush's campaign, though saying, ``in no way is this
a condition of employment or continued employment at Enron.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following three months, Enron executives kicked in more
than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to comment for this article. A campaign spokesman,
Dan Bartlett, said Bush and Lay have been close friends for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he heads this company is secondary to their
personal relationship,'' Bartlett said. ``One issue that you could
say that Enron has played a key role in shaping the debate is
deregulation. Governor Bush does share in their philosophy of
competition in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Lay, the son of a preacher and
farm-machinery salesman from Missouri, Enron is now widely regarded
as one of the toughest and most innovative companies in the nation.
It is a fearsome competitor in the huge market for the trading of
electricity, energy commodities and derivatives contracts linked to
energy prices _ a business that it helped create.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Enron, with $40.1 billion in sales last year,
builds and operates power plants around the world, including
Poland, Turkey, and a huge project in the Indian state of
Maharashtra that a few years ago became one of the most
controversial issues in the Indian government. Enron still runs the
second-largest natural gas pipeline network in the United States.
And it dazzled Wall Street in January when it unveiled its latest
venture, the trading of bandwidth needed for high-speed data
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Enron officials say some of the company's foreign projects may
not be insurable without the backing of the Overseas Private
Investment Corp., a federal agency that limits risk to U.S.
companies investing abroad. OPIC provided financing or insurance
coverage worth almost $300 million for Enron's foreign projects
just last year, according to OPIC records.
</P>
<P>
   Enron officials have in the past asked Bush to help lobby
lawmakers to appropriate funds for OPIC, as well as for the
Export-Import Bank, another federal agency that aids American
companies abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In one such letter, obtained by The New York Times under Texas
open records laws, Lay in March 1997 asked Bush to contact every
member of the Texas delegation to explain how ``these export credit
agencies of the United States are critical to U.S. developers like
Enron who are pursuing international projects in developing
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Lay's request was to be ``handled'' by the state-federal
relations office, a lobbying office the state of Texas maintains in
Washington, according to a note written on the letter by a Bush
staff member. But according to Bartlett, the Bush spokesman, Bush
officials have not lobbied on behalf of either agency.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the most important issue to Enron is legislation
that would require the nation's electric grid to transmit power in
a more uniform and free-flowing manner, perhaps by giving the
federal government more control over transmission lines while
taking some power away from state utility commissions. In Texas,
Bush has always been an advocate of electric utility deregulation,
but the specifics of his support did not always fall Enron's way.
Late in the 1997 legislative session, after Bush's attempts at
sweeping tax reform failed, he tried to push through a last-minute
deregulation bill. To succeed, the bill needed support from the
state's big utilities, but Enron officials felt the bill was
weighted so far in favor of the utilities that they could not
endorse it. The bill ultimately failed. In 1999, Texas lawmakers
passed a deregulation bill that Lay said is probably the best in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a group of large energy and manufacturing companies,
Enron lobbied during the 1997 Texas legislative session for lower
property taxes. Before the session began, Bush appointed a
17-member committee to study the issue which included Richard
Kinder, who was then Enron's president. The proposal Bush
introduced would have resulted in $9 million in annual tax savings
to Enron. But the Bush plan had little legislative support, and it
soon died.
</P>
<P>
   Enron has also sought Bush's help on narrower issues. In
November 1998, the chairman of Enron Oil &AMP; Gas, which at the time
was majority-owned by Enron but is now a separate public company
called EOG Resources, complained to Bush that the state comptroller
was improperly assessing the company about $415,000 in crude-oil
production taxes. The chairman, Forrest E. Hoglund, who has also
been a Bush donor and has since retired, wrote to Bush: ``We need
to have this handled before there is a big industry backlash. Sorry
to bother you with it.'' The case is still pending, according to
officials at the comptroller's office. Bartlett, the Bush
spokesman, said the Enron Oil &AMP; Gas complaint, and similar letters
from four other companies, were routed to Albert Hawkins, Bush's
budget director. One of Hawkins' staff members called the
comptroller's office to inquire about their methodology but did not
suggest rescinding or easing the action against Enron Oil &AMP; Gas,
Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Bush's inauguration in 1995, Enron had built
relationships with both the Bush family and officials from the Bush
administration. In addition to Lay being a big fund-raiser and
supporter of the former president, Enron and its affiliates later
hired a number of high-level Bush officials, including former
Secretary of State James Baker III and former Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush has even been accused of working on Enron's
behalf. Rodolfo Terragno, a senior Argentinean official, has told
several publications that after President Bush was elected in 1988,
he received a call from George W. Bush asking him to award a
pipeline contract to Enron.
</P>
<P>
   Terragno, who is currently the Argentinean cabinet chief,
declined requests for an interview. But in an e-mailed statement he
said he now is not sure if the call came from George W. Bush or
from one of his brothers, perhaps Neil Bush. Bush officials say no
one from the family ever lobbied for Enron or spoke to Terragno
about the project.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lay: ``No member of the Bush family has ever been on the
Enron payroll.'' &QL;

STRATEGIES: THE WAYS OF ONE-YEAR WONDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By MARK HULBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you're hot, you're hot.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about the weather, but about the attitude of
many investors when choosing an investment adviser. They're
surprisingly eager to follow an adviser with a poor long-term
record, provided that he or she has had recent success. They
believe that such advisers have so-called hot hands _ that just
because they have beaten the market or their peers in the short
term, they are likely to keep doing so for at least a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   These same investors, meanwhile, are quick to shun advisers with
splendid long-term returns if their recent performance hasn't
measured up.
</P>
<P>
   But can investment advisers really have hot hands? Statisticians
have researched the matter exhaustively, and the picture that has
emerged is somewhat mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for hot-hand advocates is that investors will make
more money by investing in last year's top market-beaters than they
will by following advisers at the bottom of last year's list.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that this strategy probably won't help investors
beat the market.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the
University of Pennsylvania, conducted one of the most extensive
studies on the question. First he scrutinized every buy or sell
recommendation on an American stock by 153 investment newsletter
editors from 1980 to 1996. Then he constructed two hypothetical
portfolios _ the first designed to follow the stock-picking
recommendations of the 10 percent of advisers with the best
performance during the previous calender year, the second following
the recommendations of the 10 percent with the worst records. He
repeated the process every Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the winners' portfolio produced a 15.7 percent return,
annualized, from the end of 1980 through the end of 1996, versus
8.9 percent for the losers' portfolio. The overall stock market,
meanwhile, gained 14.9 percent a year, on average, over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Great. So it appears that some advisers indeed have hot hands.
</P>
<P>
   There is a problem, however. The winning managers' portfolio may
have beaten the overall market by 0.8 percentage points a year, but
the calculations did not take transaction costs into account. It is
likely that these costs would substantially reduce, if not
eliminate, that advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we explain that the hot advisers still outperformed
Metrick's losers portfolio by nearly 7 percentage points a year? I
suspect that some advisers play an icy cold hand, either because of
poor stock-picking ability or high transaction costs. In any event,
the research suggests that while investors shouldn't necessarily
follow advisers with the best one-year performance, they should
certainly avoid those with the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results have emerged from studies of mutual funds. Mark
Carhart, a former assistant finance professor at the University of
Southern California and now co-head of quantitative strategies at
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, examined the performance of U.S.
stock funds from 1962 through 1993. He initially found support for
the hot-hand idea. During any given year, the previous year's
top-performing funds have, on average, beaten the worst performers
from the year earlier. But he later found that the pattern was more
a function of the worst funds continuing their lackluster
performance than the best ones continuing to shine.
</P>
<P>
   So, it seems, hot hands don't really exist in the world of
investment advisers and newsletters. But cold ones do. Or to turn a
phrase, when you're hot, apparently, you merely aren't freezing.
</P>

STEVENSON, DOKIC AT THE CENTER OF CONTROVERSY ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-WIMBLEDON)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The All England Club's genteel image was
shattered Thursday when Jelena Dokic's father was led away by a
policeman after unruly behavior on the grounds, and Alexandra
Stevenson ended her run at Wimbledon by describing the hazing she
endured during her rookie season, which, she said, included a
profane racial slur recently directed at her.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after losing to Patricia Wartusch in the second round,
Stevenson spoke about how tough it was to deal with the jealousy
she has encountered since gaining celebrity status last year. In
her Wimbledon debut, she was the object of attention. She was the
first female qualifier to reach the semifinals and it was disclosed
that Julius Erving was her biological father. An interview with
Barbara Walters quickly followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of made a big splash,'' Stevenson said. ``I don't think
a lot of girls appreciated it. They have to grow up and have bigger
minds, not be so petty.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson said that at a tournament in Strasbourg, France, last
month, a French player, Amelie Cocheteux, hurled a profane racial
slur at her during every changeover of their match. The next day,
she said, another French player, Anne-Gaelle Sidot, pushed her
mother, Samantha Stevenson, and pulled down her hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cocheteux called me the names, and Sidot hit my mom,''
Alexandra Stevenson said. ``In the French Open, Cocheteux came up
and hit me, kind of bumped into me in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidot was not available for comment early Thursday evening, but
Cocheteux was reached by a French reporter and denied all of
Stevenson's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive officer of the Women's Tennis Association,
Bart McGuire, said the allegations were investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was determined that Ms. Sidot did not physically strike Ms.
Stevenson but did tip her hat during a conversation regarding use
of a practice court,'' McGuire said, referring to Samantha
Stevenson. `` Ms. Sidot also alleged that Ms. Stevenson used
verbally abusive language. The Tour determined no disciplinary
action was warranted.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said no proof could be found of a racial slur directed
at Alexandra Stevenson by Amelie Cocheteux. Tour officials found no
witnesses to substantiate the allegation of the bumping in the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Damir Dokic spun out of control. About 20 minutes
after Jelena Dokic defeated Gala-Leone Garcia on Court 5, he was
seen walking unsteadily through the grounds, waving the flag of St.
George. As he entered the third floor of the press center,
witnesses heard him ranting ``the Queen's side of the country is
beautiful, the other side is fascist.''
</P>
<P>
   He also began criticizing the WTA for its treatment of his
daughter, who was fined for being four hours late to an interview
at the Australian Open. Mark Saggers, a sports reporter for
Britain's Sky Sports, said that Dokic smashed his cell phone into
three pieces after that. A police officer led Dokic away. Saggers
gave a statement to the police, but said he would not press
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Andrew Freestone of the Metropolitan Police Service
said that Dokic came to the police room voluntarily, that the Dokic
family chose to leave the grounds and that no further action would
be taken.
</P>
<P>
   At a tune-up for Wimbledon in Birmingham last June, Dokic began
shouting at spectators during his daughter's match and was ejected.
Later, he was picked up by the police when he was spotted lying in
the middle of a road. They said he was was cautioned for drunken
and disorderly behavior and was released without being charged.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Damir Dokic's outburst coincided with a WTA statement
concerning a new policy to help eliminate distractions created by
parents, friends and coaches. The players' council voted to
restrict access to locker rooms at all tour events to players only.
Alexandra Stevenson said she believed the rule was ``silly'' and
that it was aimed at her mother and the mother of Martina Hingis.
The WTA denied that the rule was directed specifically at mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rule is fair,'' said Chris Evert, who is at
Wimbledon as an analyst for NBC. ``Players need a place to be
alone.''

DOUG SAHM: `SAN ANTONIO ROCK: THE HARLEM RECORDINGS 1957-1961' 
</HEADLINE>
   By BEN RATLIFF

<P>
   DOUG SAHM: ``San Antonio Rock: The Harlem Recordings 1957-1961''
(Norton).
</P>
<P>
   For a pop singer, ``crossing over,'' in the racial sense, almost
always means someone of color reaching a white audience; rarely is
the reverse even tried. But at 17, Doug Sahm, a white singer from
San Antonio, was doing a double twist: making records in a black
rhythm-and-blues style for a Chicano audience.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he would form the Sir Douglas Quintet, a great rock band
of the 1960s and 1970s that combined British Invasion pop, urban
blues, a touch of West Coast psychedelia and the two-step thump of
Tex-Mex conjunto music. But Sahm never forgot his hometown: in his
songs with the quintet, he left a trail of references to San
Antonio, enough to convince you that it was a magical place,
possibly overlooked among the important American towns of early
rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio Rock'' explains it all. In San Antonio, a number
of things naturally came together: T-Bone Walker's blues, Gulf
Coast rhythm-and-blues, country music, an older generation's
accordion-driven conjunto. Sahm absorbed it all, a fiendishly
precocious singer and guitarist before he was legally old enough to
play in the bars where he plied his trade, with a hoarse, rugged
voice that he pushed into gothic swoops, shouts and trills.
</P>
<P>
   The CD collects the singles he recorded as a member of local
bands with swanky names like the Dell Kings, the Mar-Kays, the
Twisters and the Pharaohs. His manic version of Larry Williams'
``Slow Down'' is inspired by Little Richard; his own ``Why Why
Why'' and ``More and More'' are lovely, slow, tortured ballads,
with Fats Domino-style piano triplets and sweet harmonies from two
tenor saxophones, lining the song like fat fins on an old car.
Typical of Norton's rereleases, the CD is well annotated; the liner
notes are a full disquisition on the San Antonio scene of the late
'50s.

MONEY &AMP; MEDICINE: OFF THE MANAGED-CARE TREADMILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Haddad, a pediatric ear, nose and throat doctor in
Manhattan, said he realized how dropping out of managed care was
paying off for him as he sat watching his son's preschool
graduation. Haddad's workload has shrunk markedly _ 20 percent
fewer surgical cases, a similar decline in office visits _ since he
stopped abiding by the insurers' fee scales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is home for dinner most nights and can attend his older
son's activities. ``You realize how important that is when your kid
keeps waving at you the whole time,'' he said, recalling the
graduation ceremony. Ditching managed care, he said, ``was really a
quality-of-life issue.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of doctors around the country have taken the same
calculated risk in the last few years, by deciding to stop settling
for what insurance would pay. They cite low reimbursement rates
that forced them to make up revenue in volume, crowding their
waiting rooms with patients and rushing their care. The pace and
the paperwork stole too much time from their personal lives, the
doctors say. And frankly, some just disliked making less money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these rebel doctors practice in cities where there are
plenty of affluent patients who can pay cash or who have access to
old-fashioned indemnity insurance that simply reimburses the
patient for most of the bill. Doctors in suburbs where managed care
has all but cornered the health insurance market have less scope to
drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Barney Softness, a pediatrician on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, decided last year to tell his managed-care patients _
who made up about one-third of his busy practice _ that he would no
longer accept their insurance. Half left immediately, and he
finished the year on a sour financial note. But he was happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great benefit was, it was much quieter,'' Softness said. He
and his partners were able to reduce the number of patients each
saw in an hour to just four, from five or six under managed care.
``We had time to do it right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then something happened: The lost patients started coming back.
``Some said, `It is worth it to us,''' Softness said, ``the
implication being that they were getting mill-like treatment.''
Now, he said, ``we are back to being as busy as we were.'' If it
gets too busy, he said, he may have to stop accepting new patients.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I have firsthand experience of the changes in
Softness' practice: My own baby has been seen by his partners since
shortly after they dropped the plans. Care was great, service
speedy at first; lately, I've been kept waiting from 10 to 40
minutes, though once we get into an examination room, I still feel
that my child is the only one the doctor is seeing that day.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, my own primary-care doctor, who accepts many insurance
plans, never makes me wait, and never rushes me either.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few patients feel that their doctors neglect their care
as a result of insurance company pressures, according to a new
survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change, an
independent research organization in Washington. The study, based
on interviews with 59,000 Americans, found that while 44 percent
thought that the companies do influence doctors' care decisions,
only 7 percent said they believed doctors put insurers' interests
ahead of patients' needs. The center got similar results in 1997,
before the backlash against managed care had gathered steam.
</P>
<P>
   The response may mean that patients are simply not aware of how
stressed-out their doctors are. Or it may signal that patients do
not agree with their doctors' view that quality erodes as revenues
rise. Even if they do agree, most patients have little choice: Few
earn enough to afford doctors' fees on their own, and doctors say
they have had to turn away patients for financial reasons. ``There
are a lot of interesting cases that I might want to do, but can't,
because the families are constrained by their choice of
insurance,'' Haddad said.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Sheldon, a family doctor in Denver who opened a
no-managed-care office after working for a managed-care company in
Vermont, said he has found a way around the problem. He charges
patients $4 a minute. If he sees them for 10 minutes, they pay $40,
which, he said, is cheaper than an office visit at most nearby
clinics. ``It is a win-win,'' he said. ``I have patients who are
rich and poor, and they come because they love the service.''
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic, a patient might pay $60 for a 10-minute visit _ or
the same for an hour, making it hard to say if Sheldon's approach
really optimizes care and cost for patients.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors do not have the chance to test such theories. Peter
Shutkin, an internist in New Canaan, Conn., recently decided that
he had had enough of Aetna. But while he may fantasize about
extending the take-a-hike message to the other four plans he
accepts, he knows it's no use. ``Practically, I don't think it
would work,'' Shutkin said. ``I wouldn't have any patients left.''

   A constitutional court ruled that President Leonid Kuchma's plan
to strengthen his powers over Parliament does not violate the
constitution. The ruling paves the way for Kuchma to submit the
changes to Parliament, which must pass them by a two-thirds
majority. Some opposition leaders want to water down the proposals,
fearing that Kuchma's executive powers will too easily override the
legislature's. Ever since Kuchma won re-election in November, he
has been campaigning for stronger powers to break the many
deadlocks that have snarled economic reform plans.

   Austria said it was willing to cooperate with a panel of ``wise

who will send their findings to the other 14 European Union

Ahern, who handled party finances at the time, said he was aware of

ALBRIGHT URGES DELAY IN SUMMIT BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Before heading to the White House to brief
President Clinton on her visit to the Middle East, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said Thursday that the administration did
not feel pressured to call a summit immediately between the
Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said there ``was plenty of time to do what needs to be
done'' and that ``our calculus is Jan. 20,'' the day President
Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the capital after meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in Jerusalem and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at Ramallah on the West Bank, Albright signaled that the
time was not right for a summit next week, a schedule that the
Israelis had been eager for.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have consistently said that the
president will determine after Albright's visit whether the time is
right for a summit or whether it will be preferable to continue
negotiations at a lower level to massage the issues that have riven
the two sides for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have said they are ready for a three-way meeting
with Clinton and Arafat in the Washington area next week to settle
the final issues of the future of Jerusalem, the borders of a
Palestinian entity and the fate of the scattered Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright, speaking to reporters on her airplane after a
brief stop in Berlin, said that there needed to be thorough
preparation of the core issues before the leaders could be closeted
in an isolated retreat. Otherwise, there was the risk of
unnecessary failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain issues that are the type of issues where if
they are not properly prepared then you are asking for something to
be even more difficult,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of negotiations between senior negotiators,
solutions to the basic issues have been discussed in deep detail. A
senior administration official said that these subjects had been
`de-mythologized' and some gaps had been narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   On the West Bank after her visit with Arafat, a senior
Palestinian official, Saeb Ereket, said that teams would return to
Washington next week to talk for another two weeks and that a
summit was out of the question until after that.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that a summit at any time was a
gamble but that Clinton was prepared to take the risk.
</P>
<P>
   From the Israeli side, a broad brush stroke picture has emerged
for what a final deal may look like. According to these accounts,
it would include granting more than 90 percent of the West Bank for
what would make, with the Gaza strip, a Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Arafat has stuck to his demands of a full
withdrawal by Israel to the borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli
war. In private, however, Arafat was more flexible, realizing that
some Israeli settlements would remain in the West Bank,
administration officials said.

 &HT;    Squirrel, moose _ and puns
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wisecracks, wordplay and terrible, terrible puns jump from
the small screen to the big one in ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle.'' The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic
squirrel and moose into the 21st century, and into three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Their flesh-and-blood co-stars include, of all people, Robert De
Niro, wearing a big facial scar and an oil-slick hairpiece as
Fearless Leader. (De Niro is also one of the producers.)
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only high-end collaborator. Director Des McAnuff is
a two-time Tony winner for his Broadway work; the script is by
admired New York playwright Kenneth Lonergan; and the movie boasts
cameos from Billy Crystal, Carl Reiner, Whoopi Goldberg, John
Goodman and three different turns by Jonathan Winters.
</P>
<P>
   But as lively and well-crafted as the movie is, it never answers
the burning question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``R&AMP;B'' gets off to a dandy sardonic start as the Narrator
(Keith Scott, who also voices Bullwinkle) recaps the history of the
TV show, canceled in 1964, and presents us with the woeful decline
since then of the cartoon characters' home base, Frostbite Falls.
``All this exposition is wearing me out,'' Bullwinkle complains,
one of the many cracks that give the movie its loopy, self-aware
charm.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``R&AMP;B'' mocks its own existence. The Narrator
continues to hold forth, showing us how East European badniks Boris
and Natasha are, via expensive special effects, ``converted into
even more expensive motion picture stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Namely, Jason Alexander with a mustache like two opposing pencil
tips, and Rene Russo vacuum-packed into a series of darkly
glamorous dresses. Then, of course, there's De Niro, whose Fearless
Leader plots to take over the human world through his network, RBTV
(Really Bad Television), his broadcasts turning couch potatoes into
zombies who will vote him into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So it's up to rookie FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) to
bring the squirrel and the moose from rerun-land into our own
world. ``I think we're on the wrong show,'' Bullwinkle marvels at
his first sight of Karen: ``Look how well they drew that girl!''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, Perabo is lovely, looking like a blond fusion of
Natalie Portman and Hilary Swank. But in this, only her second
movie, she lacks the wit and timing to hold her own against her
computer-generated co-stars. Which means that the threesome's long
road trip from Hollywood to New York can seem long indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half
offers diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway
sight gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop
culture japes. (Personally, I could have done without an
awkward-looking De Niro sending up his own ``you talkin' to me''
riff from ``Taxi Driver.'') And its ludicrous but literate humor
might teach kids that comedy can be more than just gross-out jokes.
But the movie never quite develops into a consistent vision:
hipster salute to a beloved old shoe, or newly minted kiddie flick?
Like Rocky and Bullwinkle stranded in the 3-D world, it's a little
lost, stuck somewhere between nostalgic baby boomers and the
Pokemon crowd.
</P>

</P>

 &HT;    Rave on in search for `Groove'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching ``Groove'' is like listening to a friend tell you about
the awesome dream he had last night: the colors, the sounds, the
sights. You smile and nod and wonder how long you have to wait
before politely changing the subject. Then he notices your frozen
smile and glazed eyes and mumbles, ``I guess you had to be there.''
Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   The second rave movie of the year, this is a big step up from
the snide and empty-headed Welsh import ``Human Traffic.'' But the
problem with any movie about an altered state _ whether it's a
dream or, as in this case, a drug-and-sound-fueled dance party _ is
that it's very hard to capture on film the subjective highs of the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove'' struggles against two impulses. It wants to catch the
techno-exultance of dancing, driven by the up-till-dawn euphoria of
the ravers' drug of choice, Ecstasy. But it also settles into some
traditional dramatic, um, grooves as it tracks a handful of San
Franciscans through the all-night event in an abandoned warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   They include longtime ravers Colin (Denny Kirkwood) and his
girlfriend Harmony (Mackenzie Firgens), who coax Colin's uptight
would-be novelist brother David (Hamish Linklater) along.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the warehouse is half the fun of ``Groove.''
Writer-director Greg Harrison shows a where-and-when e-mail making
its way round the city's hipper computer screens, and the partyers
prepping for fun _ strapping on their glitter platforms and lining
up their party pills. A girl at the laundry turns the sound of a
washing machine into a secret dance beat in her mind. A guy on the
subway proudly carries a mirrored disco-ball on his lap.
</P>
<P>
   You can see that the semi-secrecy is part of the thrill. The
partyers follow hush-hush directions to the chosen spot. Only the
cool ones get the invitation, so they're a self-proclaimed
in-crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Buttoned-up David definitely seems out of place, but soon he has
popped his X and is being shown the ropes by be-cool rave regular
Leyla (Lola Glaudini). They flirt, they dance, they talk. They talk
too much, really, in a long dialogue that has Leyla starting to
question what she's doing with her life. It's the only moment when
``Groove'' suggests that partying your brains out might not be the
best thing to do with your life.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a subplot about a character who starts to question
his sexuality, but this thread feels arbitrary and forced. What
never flags in the film is the music, played by a series of
celebrated DJs, culminating with John Digweed, who is treated by
the others as a god.
</P>
<P>
   You walk out of ``Groove'' admiring Harrison's enthusiasm and
his drive to convey this high-energy phenomenon on-screen. It's a
good try. But, yeah, you kinda have to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lola Glaudini and Hamish Linklater. Rated R for drug
use, language and brief sexuality. 1 hour, 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A long night's journey into day, with glo sticks.

</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,
43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro,
</P>
<P>
   Rene Russo, Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM)1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Momma's House'' PG-13 (crude humor, sexual,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's one super-sized Martin Lawrence. As an FBI agent on a
neighborhood stakeout to capture a vicious bank robber, Lawrence
dons layer upon layer of prosthetics to impersonate a 325-pound,
small-town granny in Cartersville (the movie, however, was filmed
in Los Angeles). The results may be predictable, but with
Lawrence's manic comedic timing they are also occasionally quite
funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 39 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Nova'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Amy Irving.
</P>
<P>
   A friendly bit of romantic fluff starring Amy Irving as a widow
who teaches English in Rio de Janeiro and is courted by a charming
attorney (Antonio Fagundes). This is both a beguiling advertisement
for a vacation in Brazil and a valentine to Irving from her
director/husband, Bruno Barreto. Think of the film as being a bit
like falling in love: light-hearted and a little silly. (ERG)1
hour, 35 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night stander and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM)1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterfly'' R (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Manuel Lozano
</P>
<P>
   and Fernando Fernan Gomez,.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through the eyes of 6-year-old Moncho (Manuel Lozano), the
countryside of Galicia, in northern Spain, is a place of young
fears and growing wonders. ``Butterfly'' is about a young boy
inspired to learn by the teacher (Fernando Fernan Gomez) who
frightens him the most. It builds slowly and then explodes, showing
us how fear can turn good people into mundane monsters. (SM)1 hour,
35 minutes. In Spanish with subtitles. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Mel Gibson and
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG)1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM)1 hour,
30 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,
</P>
<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia / 2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mickey Mouse,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin and Bette Midler.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, go shopping, then go rent the original.
(ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM)1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove'' R (drug use, language
</P>
<P>
   and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lola Glaudini
</P>
<P>
   and Hamish Linklater.
</P>
<P>
   The second rave movie of the year, ``Groove'' tracks a handful
of San Franciscan partiers who venture to an abandoned warehouse in
hopes of an all-night rave party. The problem with any movie about
an altered state _ whether it's a dream, or in this case a
drug-and-sound-fueled dance party _ is it's very hard to capture on
film the subjective highs of the real thing. (SM) 1 hour, 26
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' R (some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,
</P>
<P>
   Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Venora
</P>
<P>
   and Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In its bare outline, a modern-day, Manhattan-based version of
Shakespeare's tragedy sounds like the bad thesis project of a New
York University film student. True enough, Michael Almereyda's
update flirts with the ludicrous in every reel. But it's ultimately
a compelling and streamlined vision that lives surprisingly well in
the city's hard-edged, chilly streets and penthouses. (SM)1 hour,
51 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) 22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger, Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. Relying on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest movie directed Wolfgang Petersen. Based
on Sebastian Junger's best-seller, it re-creates the collision of
three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the battle of men
(George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg) and women (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrontonio) at sea, trying to survive the monstrous sea. (SM) 2
hours, 15 minutes B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' R (sexuality, crude humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Green.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters''),
``Road Trip'' is about a quartet of guys who try to retrieve a sex
video. The trip has its share of gross-outs _ from making fun of
large women to doing something completely disgusting with French
toast. It's a witless, dumb and dumber version of ``Animal House,''
and its saving grace, MTV genius Tom Green, isn't in it enough.
(Bob Longino) 1 hour, 31 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaft'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson,
</P>
<P>
   Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright.
</P>
<P>
   You can dig it. Sporting the original Oscar-winning theme song,
the ``Shaft'' 2000, starring Samuel L. Jackson, is one bad
I'm-messin'-with-your-head movie. While the plot is a trumped-up
trifle involving both a suspected racist killer (Christian Bale)
and whacked-out drug lord (Jeffrey Wright), the movie clicks
because of the performances. Wright steals the picture, directed by
John Singleton. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' PG-13 (action violence, some
</P>
<P>
   drug humor, profanity and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan
</P>
<P>
   and Owen Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts whiz Jackie Chan plays a Chinese imperial guardsman
who volunteers to head to the United States to rescue a kidnapped
princess. ``Noon'' lets Chan use moose antlers, horse shoes and
pine saplings as weapons, take a big fall from a mission bell
tower, and contend with a drunken horse. The film lassos all the
revisionist laughs and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild
West'' botched. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' PG (some cartoon violence)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good sign when a 'toon's backgrounds are more
interesting than the plot and characters. ``Titan'' is an animation
set in the 31st century after Earth has been destroyed. The human
race's only hope is a guy named Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) who's
the key to the missing Titan project designed by his dad. Like most
sci-fi flicks, this one is more of a super-deluxe episode of the
old ``Jonny Quest'' series. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 56
minutes. B-

 &HT;    Better take the life jacket: `Storm' will rock your boat
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in ``A Perfect Storm,'' the latest movie to prove
director Wolfgang Petersen (``Das Boot,'' ``Air Force One'') a
master of action and ratcheting tension.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Sebastian Junger's best seller, it re-creates the
collision of three weather systems in the fall of 1991 _ and the
battle of men and women at sea, trying to stay alive in the
indifferent teeth of nature.
</P>
<P>
   We meet the men of the Andrea Gail as they dock at Gloucester,
Mass., after a less than perfect haul of swordfish: Capt. Billy
Tyne (George Clooney), Bobby Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Murph (John
C. Reilly) and Alfred Pierre (Allen Payne). When Tyne, to score a
bigger paycheck, decides to head back out again, he brings on sixth
crewman Sully (William Fichtner) _ who starts a grudge match with
Murph, raising tension on the boat long before the skies start to
boil.
</P>
<P>
   We also meet the folks left landside: Bobby's girlfriend Chris
(Diane Lane) and his bar-owner mother; Murph's ex-wife and little
boy. There's an emphasis on family bonds. One of the fishermen,
ready to give up this dangerous life, promises he's going out
``just one more time, I promise.'' You shouldn't say things like
that in a movie.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't slice-of-life Gloucester, but a shortcut, Hollywood
gloss on it. The script relies on a fair share of hokiness (the
only real drawback to the movie). But it works. We get enough time
to care for the principals before the story steers them into wet
hell. Enjoy the movie's first half; you won't get much downtime for
the last hour. First come spooky omens, then accidents, then lots
and lots of water as the waves swell until they look like waltzing
skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm'' is feasible as a movie only because of the advances in
computer animation. Oh, you'll spot bits of obvious fakery during
the big storm scenes. But the computer-generated effects are
orchestrated with such energy and muscle that you'll feel almost
literally swept away. They create the topsy-turvy surrealism of a
bad storm, pitching us to the height of a surge, then plunging us
into the pit below. You'll walk out of the theater glancing up at
the summer thunderheads with a sense of quiet dread.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book, the movie cuts away from the Andrea Gail's
battles, making digressions to follow the Coast Guard's attempt to
rescue a trio on a pleasure boat, and then members of their own
team after they're forced to ditch their helicopter. You can't care
as much for these stick figures, but Petersen stages the action
with unending thrills.
</P>
<P>
   In a fine and very wet ensemble cast, Clooney wisely never tries
to make the captain ingratiating; he's an edgy, tense leader who
seems a match for the threats to his boat. Wahlberg and Lane are
also good, though Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as the captain of
another ship, is mainly stuck shrieking warnings on her radio.
</P>
<P>
   When so many movies promise a roller-coaster ride, ``Storm'' is
one of the few that delivers more than noise. Though based on fact,
some of the events we see are speculative, things that might have
occurred. The movie makes them all scarily plausible. It shows us
what it might feel like to ride the back of a banshee, praying that
its death screams aren't meant for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane. Directed
by Wolfgang Petersen. Rated PG-13 for profanity and scenes of

   The verdict: It'll blow you away.

HEALTH PROVIDERS SEEK TO COUNTERACT ADS BY DRUG MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A politically potent coalition of 69 health plans, several large
employers, unions and consumer advocates is beginning a broad
campaign to slow the surge in spending on prescription drugs. They
hope to counter drug makers' huge marketing and advertising
campaigns directed at doctors and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, Rx Health Value, includes Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, Kaiser Permanente and 21 other independent nonprofit
managed-care companies. Together, they have 83 million members.
Other members include General Motors, GTE, US West, the pharmacy
benefits manager PCS Health Systems, several employer-sponsored
health care associations, the AFL-CIO, the United Automobile
Workers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, the American Hospital Foundation and AARP.
</P>
<P>
   The new group, whose members have a clear stake in cutting drug
costs, plans to move on a number of fronts to try to blunt what it
sees as a distortion of the health care system by the long-running
marketing success of drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the group plans to tell doctors and
consumers about independent studies showing which drugs, old and
new, are most effective, and will seek to increase the influence of
consumers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies spent $13.9 billion to market drugs in
1999, including pitches to doctors and advertising aimed at
consumers. That was over 50 percent more than they spent in 1996,
before regulators opened the door to a torrent of advertising
directed at consumers. Coalition members say that has contributed
to a steep rise in drug spending. Fueled by heavily advertised,
expensive new products, national spending on prescription drugs has
more than doubled since 1992, to an estimated $101 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is growing to spend even more. Research in
biotechnology and the human genome promise a host of new products.
And the House voted on Wednesday to expand Medicare to cover
prescription drugs, which is projected to add billions of dollars
annually to spending. At many companies that offer generous health
coverage, spending on drugs is increasing more than 20 percent
annually. The prescription drug costs of insured individuals rose
29 percent annually from 1996 to 1999, researchers at Brandeis
University said in a study sponsored by Rx Value Health.
</P>
<P>
   The group intends to generate information that will counter some
advertising. An independent organization sponsored by Blue Cross,
RX Intelligence, to begin operating Friday, will undertake clinical
studies seeking to show which new drugs are a clear improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition plans to combine the findings of Rx Intelligence
with analyses of the drugs' cost-effectiveness and other issues and
report the findings to consumers, employees, health plans and,
especially, doctors and nurses who write prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to use its influence ``to get a consumer
perspective in front of Congress and the regulatory agencies,''
said Barry Sloat, director of health care business strategy at Ford
Motor and the auto industry's liaison to Rx Health Value.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy. With breakthroughs in biotechnology and
human genome research, ``expenditures on prescription drugs are
going to rise very rapidly,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, president
of the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research center.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association, said consumer advertising was worthwhile
because it had motivated many people to consult doctors, who then
found and treated previously undiagnosed problems. He added that
drug prices were justified because ``it's a very high-risk industry
with a long time horizon'' for developing products. This year, drug
makers will spend $26 billion, or 20 percent of revenue, finding
new drugs and getting them approved.
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers also contend that even expensive drugs save money
because they enable many patients to stay out of the hospital.
``Our medicines are the most cost-effective part of our health care
system,'' Holmer said.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he said, government studies show that expensive
``clot buster'' drugs reduce the need for hospital, rehabilitation
and nursing-home care, saving more than twice the cost of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members contend, however, that advertising does not
provide a full picture of both the limitations and the benefits of
new drugs. In May, in one of its first public moves, the coalition
called on the Food and Drug Administration to tighten controls on
television drug advertising. Spending on such advertising climbed
70 percent last year, to $1.13 billion, according to IMS Health, a
market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Jane E. Henney, the FDA commissioner, said the agency was
reviewing its advertising policies.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Goff, vice president of the Washington Business Group
on Health, a group of large employers that supports the coalition,
said, ``We want to make sure that balanced, complete information
gets out to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wolfson, chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health
Plans, which includes Kaiser, and a founder of the new coalition,
said: ``Everybody I know over 40 is on a medication. What we don't
know is the benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Celebrex, a relatively new and expensive painkiller, is
a case in point. Last year, Celebrex, part of a new class of
genetically engineered drugs, was prescribed for 25 percent of
people diagnosed with arthritis. But Celebrex is intended for
patients who have intestinal bleeding when they use other arthritis
treatments. ``We would think only 3 to 5 percent would be getting
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of consumer advertising, ``we perceive
substantial overuse, misuse and underuse'' of drugs, Sloat of Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the drug industry is going to grow at 20 percent while
everything else is growing at 3 percent, this is going to be a huge
issue for national policy,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At DaimlerChrysler, for example, drug costs will be close to
$300 million this year, almost as much as Chrysler's entire cost
for employee health benefits in the early 1980s and a 17 percent
increase over 1999, said Walter Maher, vice president for public
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase in costs is causing pain throughout the
health care system, analysts say. ``Everyone is feeling it,'' said
John Rother, public policy director of AARP. ``Everyone has a stake
in the cost of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care companies have shifted a growing share of drug
costs to patients by raising deductibles and co-payments, but they
still face double-digit cost increases, which they pass along in
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Drug spending is so high that even in the current tight labor
market, unions are increasingly contending with unwanted choices
when they negotiate new contracts: less money for health care or
less for wages and retirement benefits. ``This is a huge issue,''
said Gerry Shea, an assistant to the president of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the drug industry, which spends about $75
million annually to lobby members of Congress and federal
regulatory agencies, has usually had its way in Washington. Drug
companies have aggressively garnered support from business groups
like the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Drug costs are ``a delicate issue for the NAM, because the
pharmaceutical manufacturers are members,'' Maher said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, using a variety of special-interest organizations
like Citizens for Better Medicare, the drug makers have fended off
attempts to pass laws or rules that might lead to lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the industry obtained an FDA go-ahead that opened the
gates to heavy advertising to consumers. Drug makers also won the
right to help pay for FDA reviews of new drugs. Approvals rose by
more than 50 percent in the 1990s, Holmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rx Health is seeking to marshall ``enough heft so it can speak
with an equal voice to the pharmaceutical industry,'' said John
Golenski, executive director of the new group and a longtime
consultant to Kaiser Permanente in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research is producing new and better drugs,'' said Alain
Enthoven, a health care expert and a professor of management at
Stanford University. But, he added, ``high-quality, independent
cost-benefit analysis'' is needed to determine ``if they are all
worth the cost.''

REAGAN, O'NEILL URGED US PEACE ROLE IN ULSTER, DOCUMENTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. conspired to advance the cause of peace in
Northern Ireland at a key juncture in 1984, pressing British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to recognize an American and Irish role
in the affairs of the troubled province, newly-released documents
show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reagan White House papers, which were part of more
than 10,000 pages released to The Boston Globe by his presidential
library under the US Freedom of Information Act, the former
president was persuaded by a personal appeal by the late House
Speaker to make a private approach to Thatcher, the world leader
with whom Reagan had his closest personal and ideological ties.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also shed new light on Reagan's personality and
private sense of ethnic identity; offer tantalizing glimpses into
the hidden world of high-level diplomacy, and add detail and
texture to the former president's relationships with Thatcher and
O'Neill, his foremost domestic political foe.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the O'Neill-Reagan diplomatic maneuver, detailed in
public for the first time by the newly-released papers, has been
confirmed for the Globe in interviews with Reagan's top White House
aides; former staffers to O'Neill, and Irish diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to personally share with you my deep concern,'' O'Neill
wrote Reagan on Dec. 13, 1984. ``The best hope for a peaceful,
lawful and constitutional resolution to the tragedy of Northern
Ireland may be in serious jeopardy as a result of Mrs. Thatcher's
public statements.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Thatcher at the presidential retreat at Camp
David on Dec. 22, Reagan replied to the speaker on Jan. 9, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a special effort to bring your letter to her personal
attention and to convey your message of concern,'' Reagan wrote.
``I also personally emphasized the need for progress in resolving
the complex situation in Northern Ireland, and the desirability for
flexibility on the part of all the involved parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher, who had lost close friends and been personally
targeted by Irish Republican Army terrorist attacks, bent to
Reagan's private appeals. In their Camp David discussions, she
promised to renew diplomatic talks with Irish Prime Minister Garret
FitzGerald, Reagan informed O'Neill. In November 1985, the Irish
and British leaders signed the landmark Anglo-Irish agreement,
recognizing an Irish role in the affairs of the troubled North.
</P>
<P>
   The library files demonstrate how Reagan _ fresh off a
sentimental trip to his ancestral home of Ballyporeen in Ireland in
the summer of 1984 _ chose to overcome the pro-British leanings of
the US State Department. They also reveal how _ in the never-ending
scheming for political advantage in Washington _ members of
Reagan's staff sought to mute O'Neill's opposition to US funding
for the Nicaraguan Contra armies by appeasing the speaker on
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped to use this as a lever against `Tip' in order to get
Contra aide moving,'' wrote one official from Reagan's National
Security Council, in a September 1986 memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan papers show how O'Neill, at one point, sweetened the
deal by agreeing to give Thatcher a coveted opportunity to address
a joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And the documents also detail how O'Neill, along with Senators
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, and former New York governor Hugh Carey _ who were known as
``the Four Horsemen'' _ played a critical role at channeling
Irish-American sentiment toward constructive purposes, thus
undercutting support for the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Working with moderate political leaders in Ireland, Northern
Ireland, and the United States, and advised by Irish diplomats and
Northern Ireland's Nobel Prize recipient John Hume, O'Neill and his
colleagues helped establish the precedent for US involvement in
Anglo-Irish affairs that President Clinton and envoy George
Mitchell have employed in the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intervention by Reagan was vital, and it was made possible
by Tip,'' said Sean Donlon, the former Irish ambassador to the
United States. The speaker's efforts in the late 1970s and early
1980s were the beginning of a process that Clinton then ``advanced
. . . to a whole new phase,'' Donlon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Horsemen had their first success in the late 1970s when
they prevailed upon Reagan's predecessor, former president Jimmy
Carter, to proclaim an American interest in the affairs of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   After Reagan was elected in November 1980, however, the US
foreign policy establishment reverted to its traditional stance:
that the United States should not anger Great Britain, its closest
Cold War ally, by meddling in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and O'Neill were rebuffed in their first approach to
Reagan, in the spring of 1981, when they asked the president to
press Thatcher to compromise with dying IRA hunger strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intense media coverage of the hunger strike in the United
States has dramatically improved the image of the Provisional IRA
among 35 million Irish-Americans and reversed a five-year trend of
declining financial support of the IRA,'' O'Neill wrote Reagan on
May 19, 1981. ``Members of the IRA are terrorists and should be
treated as such. But by refusing to negotiate regarding prison
rules, Mrs. Thatcher is permitting the terrorists to undo
significant political progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a promise that he kept to his death, O'Neill assured
Reagan that he would keep any informal negotiations a secret, and
asked the president to make ``a private and discreet expression of
concern'' to the prime minister. But Reagan declined to appeal to
Thatcher, and refused to meet with members of Congress on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little to be gained by such a meeting,'' his national
security adviser, Richard V. Allen, wrote to presidential aide Ed
Meese. Allen was more upset at the verbal ``harassment'' that
Irish-American demonstrators were giving British diplomats in the
United States. He demanded that Meese send letters to the top
police officials in Boston and New York, requesting better
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is intolerable that the representatives of our staunchest
ally in the world are subjected to this sort of treatment,'' Allen
wrote Meese, on Aug. 27, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   As the hunger strikers died, Reagan and O'Neill were waging
their historic tax and budget battle over the size and role of
American government. But despite their heated rhetorical volleys,
the two men, for both personal and practical political reasons,
never allowed their relationship to completely deteriorate. A
shared fondness for funny stories and other things Irish served as
an important bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1981, Reagan gave a private birthday lunch for
O'Neill at the White House. Calling for a bottle of champagne, the
president toasted the speaker's health saying, ``Tip, if I had a
ticket to heaven and you didn't have one too, I would give mine
away and go to hell with you.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aide Michael Deaver recalled ``It was an old Irish
toast Reagan had heard somewhere. Tip's eyes were all filled up and
they left the dining room with their arms around each other's waist
and Reagan took him down to the elevator . . . and Tip went out to
the South Lawn and beat the hell out of Reagan with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, O'Neill gave no quarter. Privately, he wrote Reagan
to thank him for ``a birthday I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, meanwhile, was cultivating another friend in Thatcher,
who endorsed the president's arms buildup and muscular approach
toward the Soviet Union and was attempting to match Reagan's
attempts to trim back government with her own conservative
revolution in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with you on our girl Margaret,'' Reagan wrote the US
Ambassador to Great Britain, Charles H. Price, in his
characteristic squiggly handwriting. If the British public ``turn
away from her, they may well have thrown away their last chance,''
Reagan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When Thatcher journeyed to Washington in 1983, Reagan rebuffed
O'Neill's requests to add Ireland to the agenda. And in May 1984,
when Hume and his Irish counterparts released the report of a
diplomatic effort called the New Irish Forum, which called for an
Anglo-Irish agreement, Reagan aide Peter Sommer wrote to his boss,
national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane that ``State and I
had earlier agreed that it would be inappropriate to draw the White
House into the middle of this complex, historical problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be very frank, I don't think we should allow ourselves to
be used by the Irish; particularly since the Irish have not been
especially supportive of our interests on such issues as Central
America,'' Sommer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But by now O'Neill had an important ally in the administration:
former judge William Clark, who served as national security adviser
and then Secretary of the Interior, and took a personal interest in
Irish affairs. Clark worked with Kennedy and O'Neill and their
staffs, and provided an important countervoice to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher agreed to discuss the findings of the New Irish Forum
with FitzGerald, but then she narrowly escaped death when the IRA
bombed her Conservative Party's conference in October 1984. At a
famous press conference following talks with FitzGerald that
November, she curtly dismissed three compromise proposals to give
the Irish a greater a voice in Northern Ireland's affairs as ``out
. . . out . . .out.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's adamant stand set the stage for O'Neill's
Dec. 13 letter, which was followed by one or more private
conversations between the speaker and Reagan, and the
Reagan-Thatcher Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office, Thatcher expressed disappointment in the
results of the subsequent Anglo-Irish Agreement, which she signed
in November 1985, on a day when a beaming Reagan and O'Neill
appeared together at the White House to hail the deal. American,
Irish, and Northern Irish leaders have since credited the agreement
as a crucial stage-setter for Clinton's involvement and the current
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Reagan and Thatcher bend to O'Neill's request?
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's rediscovery of his Irish roots, and his years of
swapping stories with the Speaker, certainly played a role, said
Deaver. Nor could Reagan and Thatcher fail to appreciate that
O'Neill was taking a political risk. The Irish-American community
in Boston and New York and other large cities was split between
moderates and militants. The British recognized the difficult role
O'Neill and the other Horsemen had taken.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an extraordinary 12-page letter to Reagan, the
indefatigable advocate for the Irish republican cause, Paul O'Dwyer
of New York, condemned O'Neill for making ``politically-motivated
pronouncements'' which ``transferred the blame for the violence in
Northern Ireland from the British occupation forces and placed it
squarely on the shoulders of the Northern Ireland victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's own political instincts and advisers told her she had
gone too far with her ``out . . . out . . . out'' remarks. And,
hoping to follow in the footsteps of her Conservative Party hero,
Winston Churchill, she coveted something O'Neill could convey: the
honor of addressing the US Congress in joint session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an occasion would be the highlight of her visit,''
British ambassador Oliver Wright wrote the speaker. Thatcher
addressed the Congress on her next trip to Washington, on Feb. 20,
1985, and met with O'Neill for an hour that afternoon.

WEST IMPRESSED WITH CLIPPERS' MOVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry West phoned Elgin Baylor Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not to set up a golfing date. Not to kibitz about the good old
days when they dispensed heroics together with the Lakers. Not even
to commiserate with Baylor over his brave choice to continue
working for Donald T Sterling all these years.
</P>
<P>
   What Jerry West had to say to Elgin Baylor had to be comforting
words for the long-beleaguered general manager of the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to congratulate Elgin for what a great job he
did on draft day,'' said West, referring to Baylor's dramatic
makeover of the Clippers during Wednesday's NBA draft in which he
(a) acquired the top high school player in the country, Darius
Miles, (b) acquired a talented point guard from Missouri, Keyon
Dooling, (c) acquired a talented shooting guard from DePaul,
Quentin Richardson, (d) acquired still another talented shooting
guard from Yugoslavia, Marko Jaric, (e) acquired a talented
swingman from Orlando, Corey Maggett, (f) acquired a veteran
forward from Orlando, Derek Strong and (g) acquired a new
reputation for himself as being a (h) shrewd and (i) innovative
basketball executive.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Clippers, those widely disparaged, cruelly demeaned,
savagely ridiculed Staples Center co-tenants with the Lakers,
actually seemed to have pulled off a major coup.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly!
</P>
<P>
   ``Darius Miles has tremendous potential, and I think the L.A.
fans will like him,'' says West. ``What the Clippers did was get a
lot of young players who figure to be together for a long time
because of the five-year rookie cap. Lamar Odom and Darius Miles
one day could be quite a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not comparable to the heralded combo on West's team,
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, but, well, at least the Clippers
for a change are being discussed without people poking fun at them.
. .
</P>
<P>
   bullet With so many youngsters now on their roster, the Clippers
figure to struggle mightily again next season, but figure to lose
in a more entertaining manner because these youngsters are all so
athletically gifted. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet Gosh, I'm embarrassed. Here I write about sports for a
living, and can't even recall the name of the Clipper coach. Am I
suffering the from puglistic dementia, or the first signs of
Alzheimer's Disease? Maybe so because I simply have no idea who's
coaching the team at the moment. Perhaps I will by the start of the
season, or will I? . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet If the Lakers didn't so desperately need a power
forward---and A.C. Green's lame work during the playoffs showed
that they did---the Lakers might have taken Jaric with their first
round pick instead of Stanford's rugged Mark Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaric is a tremendous shooter,'' says West. ``I'm very high on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   West also is high on Mark Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fearless banger who will provide us with some inside
muscle,'' says West. ``I think he's going to turn out to be a good
player.''. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet Like so many modern athletes unable to resist million
dollar salaries, Orel Hershiser understandably continued his
pitching career far past his prime. I'm not surprised the Dodgers
finally waived him the other day. What surprised me was that the
Dodgers signed him in the first place. . .
</P>
<P>
   bullet The only heavyweight fight that followers of the sweet
science want to see these days is Mike Tyson against Lennox Lewis,
and I doubt it will happen because Tyson is aligned with Showtime
and Lewis with HBO.
</P>
<P>
   And that's ridiculous!
</P>
<P>
   If two bitter rivals like Don King and Bob Arum can put aside

MEXICAN POLITICIANS NOW EAGERLY COURT FEMALE VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The macho, conservative world of Mexican politics
has finally begun to show off its more feminine side as political
parties battle as never before to win the votes of women.
</P>
<P>
   Male strippers were hired to perform at one campaign rally.
Television advertisements raised questions about candidates'
relationships with their former wives, a subject long considered
taboo for public discussion. And, while the participation of
candidates' families is common in the United States, the
high-profile roles of political wives and daughters this year in
Mexico has signaled a new opening for women and women's issues in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their numbers, women have been strongly courted by
political candidates in Mexico since they gained the vote in 1953.
But in Sunday's presidential election _ currently a statistical
dead heat between the governing party candidate, Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, and the center-right opponent, Vincente Fox
Quesada _ women's votes may be decisive. Some 52 percent of the
Mexican electorate are women; more than one-third of all voters are
homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that power, the way the presidential candidates
dress, speak and arrange their schedules, whether campaigning in
urban centers or rural villages, is done in order to appeal to
women.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the National Feminine Civic Association said that for
the first time they had been invited to meetings with most
presidential candidates to express their concerns about women.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's penchant for bluejeans and cowboy boots may make him
appear more down to earth among working men, but to many women they
make him just plain sexy. And Labastida has turned to his wife,
Maria Teresa Uriarte de Labastida, to help infuse warmth and color
into his image.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Labastida is an expert on Mayan culture who moves as easily
at indigenous ceremonies as she does among the Mexican elite.
Pretty and poised, she often wraps her husband in bearhugs on stage
and gladly complies when the crowds demand she give him a kiss,
infusing warmth and personality into a candidate often perceived as
lifeless and gray. Her presence in the campaign has sparked
comparisons with Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems that Mrs. Labastida shares the same a similar
instinct for political combat. At a recent rally of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for women at the
National Auditorium, it was Mrs. Labastida who blasted Fox for his
occasional use of vulgar language, suggesting that he was not only
a bad influence on children but also undeserving of public trust.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Women like Eva Nely Duarte Ochoa, a 43-year-old housewife from
Michoacan, hung on every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see the party recognize the talents of women, for me, is
proof that they understand our needs and that they are going to pay
attention,'' said the 43-year-old housewife and mother of three
from the state of Morelos. ``Women have always participated in all
parts of society, but now we are being recognized for our
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts have paid off.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the most reliable final polls of voters showed a
statistical dead heat between Labastida and Fox among men, they
found a majority of women supporting Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Housewives, the largest segment of women voters, have long been
a loyal bastion of support for the PRI, especially those who live
in rural communities, have fewer years of education and hold more
conservative beliefs. And it seems that support is holding.
</P>
<P>
   But women's strength no longer lies only in their numbers. There
has also been evidence of a coming of age as women assume greater
control in their homes and communities. According to statistics
from the Mexican Association of Women Executives, more and more
women have moved into the work force _ with close to 40 percent of
all Mexican women involved in some type of economic activity for
the benefit of their families. Among workers, women have an average
of 1.3 years more education than men. And more than 50 percent of
all university students are women.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to be more sensitive than men to how well the
government fulfills its responsibilities, analysts say, and less
afraid to express discontent. As homemakers, they are the ones who
worry most about whether there is electricity, clean water,
reliable transportation and good schools and hospitals. And in the
workplace, they have become vocal advocates for fair wages and safe
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women, more than any other group, except maybe young people,
are the most active proponents for change,'' said Martha Sahagun, a
spokeswoman for Fox. ``They are the most forceful fighters and to
limit their importance to their numbers devalues their
significance.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Margarita Elena Tapia, a candidate for the Mexico City Council
of Delegates, considers her campaign the product of women's new
political power. The left-wing Center Democratic Party asked her to
be its candidate, she said, because of a commitment the party had
made to burgeoning feminist organizations, and because the
grass-roots organizations at work in the neighborhoods Tapia would
represent are led by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still only a few women in politics,'' she said.
``Only a few women have served as governors or as cabinet members,
but smart politicians understand that their political bases are
controlled by women.''

CONGRESS SET TO OK $1.3 BILLION COLOMBIAN ANTI-DRUG PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is expected to approve a Colombian
drug-fighting package Friday worth about $1.3 billion over the next
two years, but US officials acknowledge that it's the beginning of
at least a five- or six-year relationship, perhaps much longer.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and in congressional testimony, Clinton
administration officials said they expect the US role in fighting
the cultivation and production of drugs will last at least through
2005.
</P>
<P>
   While strongly disputing frequent warnings from opponents that
the Colombian aid package could be the start of a Vietnam-like
quagmire and the eventual deployment of US troops, administration
officials said the Colombia drug battle includes a great amount of
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody kids themselves that this is going to be done in three
or four years,'' said one US official involved in the planning of
Colombia assistance, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``If
things go on track, we should see tangible results in two to three
years, but as far as completely wiping it out, there are too many
factors for hitting a deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   In House and Senate debate, the issue of long-term US
involvement in a South American civil war was pushed to the
background. US officials, unless pressed, attempted to keep the
debate focused on this year and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate last week, only Senator Slade Gorton, a Washington
Republican, questioned whether there was an ``exit strategy'' to
the Colombian involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be a one-time appropriation,'' he said. ``It isn't
a downpayment we make on a home or an automobile. It is a
downpayment on which we don't know the schedule of future payment;
we don't know the total amount of future payments; we don't know
how we will measure success if, indeed, any success exists.''
</P>
<P>
   But US officials say there is a measuring-stick set by the
Colombians in their blueprint to battle drugs. In five years,
according to the $7.5 billion plan, the government hopes to cut
drug pruduction by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia produces or ships 90 percent of the cocaine and up to
75 percent of the heroin that enters the United States. Cocaine
production more than doubled in Colombia from 1995 to 1999, while
Peru achieved a 66 percent drop and Bolivia a 55 percent drop in
coca leaf cultivation during those years.
</P>
<P>
   It is that drop in production in Peru and Bolivia that gives US
officials confidence that Colombia's illicit crop can be
substantially reduced, despite up to 40 percent of the
California-size country not being under government control.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on March
23, General Charles E. Wilhelm, commander in chief of the US
Southern Command, said US officials had put together a six-year
counternarcotics plan.
</P>
<P>
   The first two years, he said, would be concentrated in the
southern provinces of Putumayo and Caqueta, ruled by guerrillas and
narco-traffickers; the middle two years would be in the Meta and
Guaviare provinces to the east, a mix of guerrilla and paramilitary
units; and the last two years would move to the Norte de Santander
province, much of which is controlled by paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   But, in essence, that broad plan became obsolete in May, when
the Colombian police conducted a massive spraying operation of coca
plants in Norte de Santander.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that Colombia is not going to touch the northern
areas until they finish the south is out of the window,'' said the
US official. ``The way military planning works is that you lay out
a course of action, but I don't think you can be wedded to a
six-year plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plan completely changes, the US military hardware
being sent to Colombia ensures up to five years of commitment,
according to testimony given by Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the
White House Office of National Drug Control.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by congressional leaders about training pilots and support
crew for new Blackhawk helicopters, which cost $6 million each,
McCaffrey said, ``It takes 18 months to get a Blackhawk pilot. It
takes 10 months to build the plane. It takes two to five years to
put together a credible system. . . . We'll be working at it for a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Umberg, McCaffrey's former head of drug supply
reduction and now a Washington lawyer, said his office had put
together a five-year plan for Colombia. He said after the first two
years, ``the plan emphasis changed from heavy military to a much
more robust alternative development program.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it involved moving many southern Colombia farmers
growing coca leaves into other parts of the country because ``that
region doesn't lend itself to alternative development. It doesn't
have the roads. This effort in Colombia won't be over in a couple
of years, but there should be significant progress in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this strategy, our involvement is pretty much forever,''
said Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Center for International
Policy, a Washington think tank. ``It's a cat-and-mouse game. The
growers will go from one area to the next.''

 MEXICO CITY: by women.''

   If Fox, the candidate of the opposition National Action Party,
is elected, he will be the first unmarried president of Mexico in
recent history. Both he and Labastida have been divorced, and
Labastida had acknowledged fathering a child out of wedlock. But
neither candidate seems to have suffered in popularity because of
these matters.
</P>
<P>
   Women like Olga Lidia Colina Gonzalez, a factory worker, said
she supports Fox because she likes what he has did for women when
he served as governor in her home state of Guanajuato.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told everybody that women's words are worth as much as
men's'' said Gonzalez. ``Before people used to use any bad language
they wanted with me. Now, wherever I go, I get treated with
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Labastida has appeared to win more support among
conservative women, it is generally Fox who espouses more
traditional positions on women's and religious issues, especially
abortion. A devout Catholic, Fox said he believes life begins at
conception and therefore he personally opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in his campaign, Fox was criticized as being too macho,
and even homophobic, by feminist groups when he spoke about his
feelings against abortion and when his campaign ran advertisements
questioning Labastida's masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fox's pretty and articulate daughters _ two of the four
children he adopted with his former wife _ drew on their own
existence to soften Fox's position and blunt those attacks. In
interviews with reporters, the daughters talked about how fortunate
they felt that their biological mothers decided against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at us,'' said Paulina Fox, a raven-haired
17-year-old who won second place in a national public-speaking
competition. ``Why would you end the life of someone when there are
parents looking for children to care for and make happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Fox has gained ground among women, and interestingly
most of it comes from the educated, urban, working women who would
be expected to work against him.
</P>
<P>
   According to a June 5 poll in the newspaper Reforma, he beat
Labastida among professionals older and younger than 40, among
office workers in the public and private sector, and among general
workers in public and private agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position on abortion was the only thing that made me
uncomfortable,'' said Telia Cervantes Gutierrez, a 24-year-old law
student. ``But when you see his daughters at his side, you know
that he really believes it when he says there are alternatives to
abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Fox rally last Saturday in Mexico City's main plaza,
Cervantes stood next to her own mother, Evelia Garduno, a
40-year-old homemaker who said she had decided to vote against the
PRI for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be, Garduno said, that she used to felt afraid to
vote for change. Now, she said, change seemed the best hope for the
future of her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we have waited for better houses, better schools,
better jobs,'' she said. ``I do not want to wait anymore.''

`PRISONERS OF WAR': A THOUSAND ACTS OF COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This weekend on the History Channel, Sen. John McCain discusses
his imprisonment in a North Vietnamese prison. ``I was not a
hero,'' says McCain, heroically, ``I was witness to a hundred,
thousands of acts of courage, compassion and love by men who remain
my heroes to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's recollections appear in ``Prisoners of War: Code of
Conduct,'' part of a ``Sworn to Secrecy Marathon'' featuring
prisoners and clandestine warfare, the History Channel's 12-hour
alternative to the holiday barbecue. In fact, in observance of the
long weekend, the network will be providing four such
morning-to-evening marathons, from Saturday through Tuesday, July
4. There will be lots of Nazis marching, as is usual on this
network, and tales of the American Revolution, but also programs
about cannibalism, King Tut and Dracula. Clearly, History Channel
programming executives aren't slaves to thematic coherence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code of Conduct,'' a speedy survey of the treatment of
prisoners of war from the Korean conflict through the Persian Gulf
War, celebrates American heroism. It also helps explain why McCain,
during his brief presidential campaign, appealed even to people who
didn't share his political beliefs. He presents an image of
authority but also humbleness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for me was to choose an attitude of defiance
and an attitude that they would be unable to break my spirit and my
will,'' he says in the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The program aims to honor McCain and other American prisoners of
war without delving into historical complexity or political nuance.
Without being artful or even particularly insightful, ``Code of
Conduct'' capitalizes on mesmerizing old film footage (a History
Channel specialty) and compelling stories of capture and torture.
Endurance is recognized as one kind of heroism, with the message
subliminally reinforced by having a movie hero (Charlton Heston)
narrate.
</P>
<P>
   A retired brigadier general, Kenneth North, also a prisoner of
war in Vietnam, describes the introductory method of torture used
by the North Vietnamese: pulling a prisoner's arms behind his back
and tying them together at the elbows, then yanking them higher
until bones were dislocated. ``Trying to get your attention,''
comments North, wryly.
</P>
<P>
   It's attention-getting, and sad and terrible, to hear about such
cruelty. So the program provides some balm by explaining the
inventive ways the POWs managed to communicate with one another (in
solitary confinement) and with the outside world. One American
captive, dragged in front of cameras for propaganda purposes,
blinked a message in Morse code. U.S. intelligence officers
implanted messages into letters from the prisoners' loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tells of a prisoner who gathered bits of thread and sewed
an American flag inside his shirt. Every night his fellow prisoners
saluted his shirt and said the Pledge of Allegiance. When the
Vietcong discovered the flag, they beat the prisoner badly and
threw him back in the cell. McCain remembers watching this man take
his revenge by sewing another flag, almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   These cinematic moments are placed in context, but only briefly.
We see film of diplomats scurrying and hear about the two Geneva
Conventions (1929 and 1949), in which the signing countries laid
out the rules governing prisoners of war. The program mentions a
crucial paradox: North Vietnam said it didn't have to comply with
the rules because the U.S. government had failed to call the war a
war. Therefore, the North Vietnamese argued, the POWs were pirates
and criminals, not entitled even to the meager niceties provided by
the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But with dawn-to-dusk holiday programming ahead, there's no time
to linger on complexities _ and there are many wars to relive, over
and over again.

   The Boston Globe, in a 2000-word story by staff reporter John
Aloysius Farrell, reveals that President Ronald Reagan and Speaker
Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. conspired to advance the cause of
peace in Northern Ireland at a key juncture in 1984, pressing
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to recognize an American
and Irish role in the affairs of the troubled province,
newly-released documents show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reagan White House papers, which are part of more
than 10,000 pages released to The Boston Globe by his presidential
library under the US Freedom of Information Act, the former
president was persuaded by a personal appeal by the late House
Speaker to make a private approach to Thatcher, the world leader
with whom Reagan had his closest personal and ideological ties.

RENO WILL LOOK AT NEW RULES FOR CHILD ASYLUM CASES 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez returned to
Cuba with his family, Attorney General Janet Reno said she will
review whether there should be new regulations for dealing with
children in political asylum cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're following up ... and one of the questions I want to ask
is what, if anything, should be done,'' Reno said Thursday. ``Where
do you draw the line between a 6-year-old and a 12-year-old? How do
you make these judgments?''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service regulations don't address
a minimum age for children to seek asylum against their parents'
wishes. But immigration officials have been firm, and the courts
have backed them up, in deciding that for very young children, a
parent is the best and only person who can speak for the child in
immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Elian, whose mother drowned en route to Florida
last year, his father made the decision to take him back to their
communist homeland. Despite a seven-month legal battle, Elian's
distant relatives in Miami were unsuccessful in convincing the
courts that the child should be allowed to speak for himself and
make his own decision.
</P>
<P>
   The only similar case was one involving Walter Polovchak, who
sought asylum against his parents' wishes in the 1970s to avoid
being returned to the Soviet Union. In that case, an appellate
court ruled in Polovchak's favor, saying age 12 was the lower limit
of when a child's wishes should be recognized as independent from
those of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Reno indicated Thursday that she would not favor writing a
specific age into the regulations, saying, ``I think it's going to
depend on the child.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Elian, Reno said, ``in the end, he is with his father,
and I am glad of that. I just wish he were with his father in a
democratic, free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had held out some hope throughout the long ordeal
that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, would decide to remain
in the United States, Reno said, ``One can always hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was adamant that Gonzalez was given every opportunity to
stay. ``He was sitting right there, and he said he wanted to go
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wonderful that they can now move on with their life, and
his father has made the decision, as I think he must have, under
the law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, a native of Miami who has repeatedly expressed her
devotion to the city and its Cuban-American community, also voiced
an appeal to those who feel wounded by her decisions in the case,
and by her call to remove the child from his Miami relatives' home
by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to talk to you. I would like to let you know just
how much I care about you and care about the community and what it
has done for a city I love,'' she said. ``This hurt may go too
deep, which I will regret, but I still have to do what I think is
right under the law, and I think that this little boy's father
should speak for him, and I think he should be with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general recalled visiting her hometown last
Thanksgiving and reading a story in the newspaper about Elian's
survival of the boat sinking that killed his mother and 10 other
Cuban refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I thought, what a remarkable little boy and what a sad
situation, a tragedy. And it's a mixture of so many different
things: a little boy who lost his mother, a country that is not
free. It's a story of families that have disagreements,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a story of so much of human life.''

   The Boston Globe, in a 2000-word story by staff reporter John
Aloysius Farrell, reveals that President Ronald Reagan and Speaker
Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. conspired to advance the cause of
peace in Northern Ireland at a key juncture in 1984, pressing
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to recognize an American
and Irish role in the affairs of the troubled province,
newly-released documents show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reagan White House papers, which are part of more
than 10,000 pages released to The Boston Globe by his presidential
library under the US Freedom of Information Act, the former
president was persuaded by a personal appeal by the late House
Speaker to make a private approach to Thatcher, the world leader
with whom Reagan had his closest personal and ideological ties.

A NEW `FORTRESS' FOR SISTER HAZEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL DeYOUNG   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Life is good for Sister Hazel, Gainesville's
platinum-selling rock 'n' roll group. ``Fortress,'' the band's
first album in more than four years, was released Tuesday by
Universal Records, and the band began a national tour Thursday in
St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Written entirely by the band members, ``Fortress'' shows a
muscular, confident Sister Hazel.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen years of nearly nonstop roadwork have toughened
them up; it's a much stronger album than 1996's ``Somewhere More
Familiar,'' which they recorded independently and then sold to
Universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of bands go in and try and get their live
sound on a disc, and it didn't happen,'' the singer and guitarist
Andrew Copeland said as the band members relaxed recently in a
Gainesville restaurant after a long day of rehearsal before their
tour. ``We got lucky this time, and were able to capture that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Fortress'' wasn't an easy delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere More Familiar'' was so successful that they stayed
on the road a little longer than they probably should have.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last summer, Sister Hazel convened in a Los Angeles
studio with the Guns N' Roses producer Mike Clink. ``We wanted
somebody that had made some big-sounding records to capture the
energy that our indie record didn't have,'' said Ken Block, singer,
guitarist and chief songwriter. ``We were hungry to make a real
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clink and Ritchie Zito, who co-produced, helped the
band make an album's worth of hard-rocking songs, they all knew
something was missing. ``We could've put a record out, and it
would've been a damn good record,'' said Ryan Newell, whose slide
guitar work is one of Sister Hazel's secret weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't saying everything we wanted to say, and we were
feeling creatively like we weren't all on the same page,'' Block
said. ``I remember literally sitting around the pool and saying,
`Let's stop this.' The tracks were very one-dimensional to me. I
felt like we were beating our heads against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   What was missing? Well, frankly, it was a song to match the
group's breakthrough hit, ``All for You,'' a Top 20 single in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, everyone who's in this business knows you have to
have one song that you can really be confident will succeed at
radio,'' Block said, ``or your run will be over very quickly. And
we weren't sure we had that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clink understood and bowed out. ``When we were talking about
stopping,'' Copeland said, ``I was scared and thinking, `Man, this
is it. We're crumpling right here. Something's going wrong.'
Luckily, it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The band _ which also includes the drummer Mark Trojanowski and
the bassist Jeff Beres _ took Zito to a studio in Atlanta, where he
went to work with Paul Ebersold, who had produced ``Somewhere.'' He
was someone more familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back to our support system,'' Block said, ``played a
couple shows, tested out a couple songs live before we met Paul and
Ritchie in the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we needed that balance. Because we
wanted someone who remembered where we came from, who'd helped us
shape songs that were hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of days, Block had written three new songs,
including ``Change Your Mind,'' the first single from ``Fortress''
and currently one of the most frequently played songs on radio
playlists.
</P>
<P>
   The new material was recorded quickly. ``We said, `Now we have
something that feels right,' and then everything else just started
falling into place,'' Block said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every song right behind it, we just found our groove again,''
he said. ``We remembered what it is we do and why we do it, and it
was great. `Change Your Mind,' ironically, changed the pace of the
whole record.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Sister Hazel will fly to London to shoot a ``Change
Your Mind'' video with Elizabeth Hurley, who's using the song in
her next movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortress'' is no mere rehash of early Sister Hazel _ there's a
string quartet on ``Your Winter,'' and Emily Saliers of the Indigo
Girls adds vocals to Block's ``Champagne High.'' Copeland wrote
``Strange Cup of Tea,'' Beres contributed ``Surreal,'' and
Trojanowski and Newell are credited as co-writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just something we felt was right at this point in
time, and we stand by it,'' Newell said. ``We plan on doing many
different types of records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want somebody to put in a disc and say, `That's the
way Sister Hazel will always sound. That's the stamp,' because we
want to experiment and take our fans on that journey with us.''
</P>

 By ERIC SCHMITT   with JOHN M. BRODER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate approved a bipartisan bill Thursday that
requires a growing number of secretive tax-exempt groups that raise
and spend money on political activities to reveal their donors and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he would sign the measure into law, the
first important change in the nation's campaign finance law in
nearly a quarter-century. Only six Senate Republicans voted against
the measure, which the House endorsed on Wednesday, 385-39.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of this bill proves that public interest can triumph
over special interests,'' Clinton said in a statement, urging
lawmakers to keep pressing for a more comprehensive election law
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers passed the campaign disclosure bill as Congress raced
to finish several spending bills and a measure on collective
bargaining for doctors before they adjourned for the July 4 recess
and a week of campaigning back home.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hailed Thursday's outcome as a major victory over
Senate and House Republican leaders who had tried to block the
measure, but they acknowledged that the legislation may have only a
limited impact on the remaining four months of this campaign cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pretending we don't have other loopholes to close, but
those groups that have found this an easy, painless way to go on
the attack are now going to have to scramble to figure out
different ways,'' said Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the new disclosure requirements, some of the groups
formed under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code may
reorganize as for-profit organizations and lose their tax
exemptions, or as other types of nonprofits, tax lawyers said. Some
donors may rush big contributions to the groups, hoping to slip
them in before the new law takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that the phones are ringing over on K Street right
now about how to get money into the 527s before they are
eliminated,'' said Rep. Michael N. Castle, R-Del., who supports the
bill, referring to Washington's center of high-powered lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who heads the Senate
Republican re-election campaign and voted no Thursday, played down
the measure's significance, calling it a ``relatively benign
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, an ardent opponent of the campaign finance overhaul
who is not up for re-election this year, urged fellow Republicans
who were facing re-election to vote yes ``to insulate them against
absurd charges that they are in favor of secret campaign
contributions or Chinese money or Mafia money.'' McConnell said he
voted against the bill because it was an infringement on free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas issued a statement applauding
passage of the disclosure bill. ``As I have previously stated, I
believe these third-party groups should have to disclose who is
funding their ads. As the only candidate to fully disclose
contributors on a daily basis, I have always been a strong believer
in sunshine and full disclosure.'' During the primary season, a
longtime political supporter of Bush's set up a Section 527 group
called Republicans for Clean Air, which spent $2.5 million on issue
advertisements criticizing the environmental record of a Bush
opponent for the Republican nomination, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote on the measure Thursday was 92-6. The five other
Republicans who voted no were Paul Coverdell of Georgia, Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, Connie Mack
of Florida and Don Nickles of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who championed the Senate bill, said that whatever
fallback positions the Section 527 groups took would offer fewer
filing and reporting advantages than they have now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will not solve what is wrong with our campaign
finance system,'' said McCain, promising to continue his fight to
eliminate the unlimited donations called soft money. ``But it will
give the public information regarding one especially pernicious
weapon used in modern campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   A spectrum of political players has created Section 527
committees, including liberal interest groups, wealthy individuals
and a conservative group aligned with Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
House majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations use donations for polling, advertising, phone
banks and direct-mail appeals, but are not subject to federal
filing or reporting rules so long as they do not advocate the
election or defeat of a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved by Congress would require Section 527
committees that raise more than $25,000 a year to comply with
federal campaign laws and file tax returns. They would have to
disclose any contributors who gave more than $200 and report any
expenditures above $500. These provisions would take effect as soon
as the legislation is signed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Section 527 groups would have to report their donors and
spending to the Internal Revenue Service every three months during
an election year. The information would then be made public and
posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign disclosure measure would be the first alteration of
campaign finance law since technical changes were made in 1979 to
the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Several groups operating under Section 527 said Thursday that
they would continue their fund raising and political activities
even as they reviewed their legal status.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Gallant, a DeLay ally who runs the Republican Majority
Issues Committee, said he intended to ``continue on our core
mission to give conservative voters a voice in the upcoming
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee, which acts as DeLay's political action committee,
expects to spend as much as $25 million in closely contested House
races around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Gallant said he was uncertain about the practical impact on his
group. He said the committee would comply with the law, but ``we
are deeply concerned that Congress has placed the regulation of
free speech in the hands of the tax collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're not going anywhere. You will have RMIC to
amuse and delight you throughout the election cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the political spectrum, the Sierra Club has
conducted political activities under a Section 527 organization
called the Environmental Voter Education Campaign since 1995. Dan
Weiss, the Sierra Club's political director, said the group planned
to spend about $8 million in this year's campaign on political
advertising on environmental issues. He said the group supported
Republican and Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will eagerly comply with the new law as soon as it takes
effect,'' Weiss said. ``But it's important to note that while we
strongly support the passage of this reform, 527 money is just the
tip of the soft-money iceberg. Real reform would mean banning all
soft-money contributions to political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most lavishly funded Section 527 organizations is
Citizens for Better Medicare, a group established a year ago by the
pharmaceutical industry to lobby against a government-run
prescription drug benefit under Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The group has already spent more than $30 million on television,
radio, print and Internet advertising and has been active in more
than a dozen congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for Citizens for Better Medicare,
said the group was reviewing its legal position in light of the
disclosure measure but had not decided whether it would abandon its
Section 527 status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition is not going away,'' Zielinski said. ``We will
comply with whatever legal requirements are necessary. We'll do
whatever the lawyers say we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the financial scale from the drug industry
is the Peace Voter Fund, a modestly funded remnant of the peace
movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The fund, a Section 527 group,
plans to engage in voter education and issue advocacy on
disarmament in about a dozen congressional districts this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gosse, the group's executive director, said he would follow
the dictates of the new law and continue the group's political
activities as in the past. ``Disclosure of donors is not a major
issue for us,'' Gosse said. ``So we'll just say to donors in the
future that they will be subject to federal disclosure
requirements. It's no biggie.''

ABORTION OPPONENTS PLAN NEW LAWS TO GET AROUND SUPREME COURT
DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., S.D., Ind., Ohio)  (EDS: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the Supreme Court effectively struck down bans on a
medical procedure its opponents call ``partial birth abortion,''
supporters of those bans said they were already planning a new
generation of laws that they hope will withstand further legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision Wednesday, the Supreme Court majority said
that to be constitutionally acceptable, laws that ban the
procedures must specify the type of procedure barred. The court
also required that the laws must permit even the use of that
procedure if it is considered necessary to preserve the health of
the mother. The laws existed in some 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our state senators has already contacted our office to
get assistance to draft a new law that could withstand
constitutional scrutiny,'' said L. Steven Grasz, the chief deputy
attorney general of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's ban was the only one the Supreme Court considered in
the case decided on Wednesday. But legal experts said the court's
decision was likely to invalidate similar laws around the country,
and would spur efforts to pass new bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a rush back to the drawing boards,'' said
Laurence Tribe, an expert on constitutional law at Harvard Law
School. Tribe and other legal experts said the court's majority
opinion had left little maneuvering room for the proponents of the
bans.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators and legal technicians on both sides of the
abortion issue said that, however the high court is composed,
battles over the procedure are likely to continue around the
country for years. Partial-birth abortion is the term opponents of
abortion use to describe one of several methods doctors use to
terminate pregnancies after about 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hunt, the speaker of South Dakota's House of
Representatives, said Thursday that efforts were already underway
to analyze that state's ban and ``to see what, if anything, we may
need to do to amend our statute so that we meet constitutional
muster as far as the Supreme Court is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, State Sen. Patricia Miller, who sponsored the ban
there four years ago, said she would propose legislation if
necessary to meet the requirements of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still very much believe that states have the right to
restrict partial-birth abortion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the legal fight over Nebraska's ban, other states' bans
have been challenged in state and federal courts, and judges across
the country have permanently or temporarily barred the enforcement
of many of them, often using some of the same reasons cited in the
Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   So even before the court's ruling, supporters had been working
on strategies to rewrite the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these revised bans are already on the books. Because of
court challenges, however, only eight of the bans are now in full
force across the country, according to the National Right to Life
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said those who want to ban the procedure might be
able to comply relatively easily with the requirement that the laws
describe what is banned more specifically. But they said that the
laws could falter concerning the requirement about the health of
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ban proponents said that such a broad exception permitting the
procedure would undercut the law since a physician could always say
it was needed to preserve the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, for example, an early ban was struck down by a federal
appeals court, and the Legislature enacted a new law that its
supporters say should meet some of the Supreme Court's new
requirements. That law is to take effect next month. The new Ohio
law is more specific in defining what is considered an illegal
partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Heller, the litigation director of the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy, which opposes the bans, called the
Ohio law an example of what he said would be new efforts to better
describe the prohibited abortion methods.
</P>

<P>
   The Supreme Court opinion, written by Justice Stephen G. Breyer,
said that the Nebraska law had been written too broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's decision said the Nebraska law, imposed an ``undue
burden'' on a woman's right to choose a D &AMP; E abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said the legislation is often stated very generally
because its supporters are trying to discourage all abortions, not
just those they describe as partial birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In revised laws across the country, Heller said, ``they will now
try to come up with different language that they will claim is
limited to this one specific procedure, but that really isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   His group, which has challenged many bans nationally, is
preparing to challenge the Ohio law, which, he said, remains so
broadly worded that it could be read as banning more than the D &AMP; X
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bans denied they intended to limit women's
rights to other methods of abortion. Grasz, the Nebraska deputy
attorney general, said that abortion-rights groups make that claim
to motivate their supporters with the fear that the right to
abortion is at stake, not just a limitation on a particular method
of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the states were trying to do,'' he said, ``was
ban partial birth abortion.'' Those efforts, he said, would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the abortion issue were also divided
yesterday regarding the Supreme Court's requirement that any ban _
to be constitutional _ must permit the use of the D &AMP; X procedure
if it is deemed necessary to preserve the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bans said that rule was needed to preserve a
meaningful right to choice guaranteed by the 1973 abortion
decision, Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the bans said they regarded that part of the
opinion as a trap for them. On the one hand, they said, if new laws
are too narrow, they will be struck down like the Nebraska law that
did not include an exception to preserve the health the mother. All
existing laws permit the use of ``partial-birth'' procedures if
they are necessary to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, proponents of the bans contend, if the
``health of the mother'' exception is too broad, the bans would be
ineffective because doctors would invoke it routinely to use the
banned procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In a companion suit to the landmark Roe vs. Wade case in 1973,
the Supreme Court defined ``the health of the mother'' broadly to
include factors like a woman's age, and physical, psychological or
emotional condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dorinda C. Bordlee, a special assistant attorney general in
Louisiana who has defended the state's 1997 ``partial birth'' ban,
said she was considering advising the Louisiana legislature to
amend its law to define the mother's health as ``significant
long-term physical risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a law would surely be challenged in court.``That would
force the Supreme Court to reconsider what it considers `health,'
'' Bordlee said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews yesterday, opponents and proponents of the bans
said their counterparts were unlikely to give up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If new statutes are passed that attempt to satisfy the court,
abortion providers will challenge those laws. That's been the
history,'' said Clay R. Smith, the solicitor for the State of
Montana, who has defended Montana's ban in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abortion providers have very able lawyers,'' Smith said,
``and they're very persistent.''

HEAVILY GUARDED, ELIAN BEGINS LIFE AGAIN IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Cuba's most famous little boy began his life back home
Thursday much the way he lived it in the United States: in a
comfortable house, surrounded by loved ones and under heavy
security away from public view.
</P>
<P>
   But one major difference now for Elian Gonzalez is that the
agonizing, seven-month long custody battle that had him trapped
between two families and two countries is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the homeland at last,'' a front-page headline
proclaimed in the Communist Party daily Granma.
</P>
<P>
   And while Cubans here expressed the same joy and relief that
their small hero was back for the first time since November, when
he survivied a migrant shipwreck off the coast of Florida that
killed his mother, there were no mass expressions of happiness or
demonstrations relishing victory _ by order of the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic to have Elian back where he belongs,'' said
Jacobo Ruiz, a 37-year-old Havana resident. ``But we're not going
to put on shows. The family needs to recover and we will respect
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian and his family, including his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who spent two months in the United States trying to bring
him home, spent Thursday reuniting with relatives and close friends
at a government-provided home, complete with swimming pool, in the
upscale neighborhood of Miramar.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight around the freshly painted white dwelling.
Uniformed guards sealed off streets near the home to keep visitors
and journalists at a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get things back to normal as best we can
for the family and the country,'' said one government official.
</P>
<P>
   Around the capital, that's just how things appeared. Many of the
signs and billboards demanding Elian's return have been taken down
or replaced with traditional revolutionary images and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The recently built protest plaza adjacent the US Interests
Section office, which had been the site of countless pro-government
and anti-US demonstrations by Cuban children, mothers, and workers,
was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Even the welcoming ceremony for the boy on Wednesday evening at
Havana's international airport was brief and unusually low key for
a saga that has helped rekindle Cuba's revolutionary fervor and
strengthen President Fidel Castro's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A shy and slightly awed Elian was lifted out of the private
plane by his father and waved stiffly to a small gathering of
classmates who had been quickly bused in from his hometown of
Cardenas, about 90 miles east of the capital. As he hugged teary
relatives, including the two grandmothers who tried unsuccessfully
to bring him back from the United States earlier this year, a band
played the Cuban national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   In less than ten minutes, the boy, his father, stepmother and
infant half-brother were placed into a small white Russian-made
sedan and driven away.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was allowed to return home Wednesday after the US Supreme
Court refused to intervene in the custody case between Miami
relatives and his Cuban father. The family left Washington shortly
after the final court order keeping Elian in the United States
expired at 4 p.m., ending one of the most dramatic and closely
watched legal sagas in US history.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, many of Elian's classmates returned to Cardenas, where
residents lined the streets, cheered and waved flags.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Castro _ who turned the custody battle into a
national crusade against exiled Cuban-Americans, who wanted Elian
to stay with relatives in Florida, and the US government _ did not
attend the arrival ceremony and refrained from making any public
statements Thursday, reluctant, perhaps, to further politicize the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Elian's return to Cuba is a major
victory for Castro and his 40-year-old Communist regime and its
ongoing battle against its northern neighbor. Over the last three
years, the Castro government has used a variety of international
events _ from a papal visit to an exhibition baseball game with the
Baltimore Orioles and the struggle over Elian _ to keep hammering
away at US immigration policies and a Cold War-era economic
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   So now that the Elian drama is over, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said Elian and his family would spend the
next two or three weeks at the Havana house, getting caught up on
missed schoolwork and readjusting to being back in Cuba. After
that, the family will be given a week's vacation and then return to
Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Castro government, the fight against US policies will
go on, although presumably without its young protagonist. A mass
rally of 200,000 demonstrators in the eastern city of Manzanillo is
scheduled for Saturday. And the nationally televised roundtables _
a Cuban version of the town hall meeting _ will continue, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A government statement _ one of six published in Thursday's
Granma newspaper _ appeared to introduce the next stage for US-Cuba
relations, repeating the government's criticisms of US laws that
grant Cuban refugees asylum and prohibit economic trade.
</P>
<P>
   No one ``should forget for one second that the fight for Elian's
return . . . is nothing more than the first chapter of a larger
battle that we must keep fighting,'' the statement read. ``With
Elian, we have saved a marvelous boy, but thousands of innocent
creatures . . . run the risk of being shipwrecked, hurt or
drowned.''

ABORTION OPPONENTS PLAN NEW LAWS TO GET AROUND SUPREME COURT
DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., S.D., Ind., Ohio)  (EDS: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the Supreme Court effectively struck down bans on a
medical procedure its opponents call ``partial birth abortion,''
supporters of those bans said they were already planning a new
generation of laws that they hope will withstand further legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision Wednesday, the Supreme Court majority said
that to be constitutionally acceptable, laws that ban the
procedures must specify the type of procedure barred. The court
also required that the laws must permit even the use of that
procedure if it is considered necessary to preserve the health of
the mother. The laws existed in some 30 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our state senators has already contacted our office to
get assistance to draft a new law that could withstand
constitutional scrutiny,'' said L. Steven Grasz, the chief deputy
attorney general of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's ban was the only one the Supreme Court considered in
the case decided on Wednesday. But legal experts said the court's
decision was likely to invalidate similar laws around the country,
and would spur efforts to pass new bans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a rush back to the drawing boards,'' said
Laurence Tribe, an expert on constitutional law at Harvard Law
School. Tribe and other legal experts said the court's majority
opinion had left little maneuvering room for the proponents of the
bans.
</P>
<P>
   But legislators and legal technicians on both sides of the
abortion issue said that, however the high court is composed,
battles over the procedure are likely to continue around the
country for years. Partial-birth abortion is the term opponents of
abortion use to describe one of several methods doctors use to
terminate pregnancies after about 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Hunt, the speaker of South Dakota's House of
Representatives, said Thursday that efforts were already underway
to analyze that state's ban and ``to see what, if anything, we may
need to do to amend our statute so that we meet constitutional
muster as far as the Supreme Court is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, State Sen. Patricia Miller, who sponsored the ban
there four years ago, said she would propose legislation if
necessary to meet the requirements of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still very much believe that states have the right to
restrict partial-birth abortion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the legal fight over Nebraska's ban, other states' bans
have been challenged in state and federal courts, and judges across
the country have permanently or temporarily barred the enforcement
of many of them, often using some of the same reasons cited in the
Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   So even before the court's ruling, supporters had been working
on strategies to rewrite the laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these revised bans are already on the books. Because of
court challenges, however, only eight of the bans are now in full
force across the country, according to the National Right to Life
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said those who want to ban the procedure might be
able to comply relatively easily with the requirement that the laws
describe what is banned more specifically. But they said that the
laws could falter concerning the requirement about the health of
the mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ban proponents said that such a broad exception permitting the
procedure would undercut the law since a physician could always say
it was needed to preserve the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, for example, an early ban was struck down by a federal
appeals court, and the Legislature enacted a new law that its
supporters say should meet some of the Supreme Court's new
requirements. That law is to take effect next month. The new Ohio
law is more specific in defining what is considered an illegal
partial-birth abortion.
</P>

Reproductive Law and Policy, which opposes the bans, called the
Ohio law an example of what he said would be new efforts to better
describe the prohibited abortion methods.

EX-MASS. GOVERNOR WELD, WIFE LIVING SEPARATELY, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Former Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld's move to
New York, where he has thrown himself into the city's legal and
social circles, appears to be taking a toll in at least one area of
his life: his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the former governor said the Welds are
experiencing marital difficulties. Susan Roosevelt Weld, who
maintains the family home in Cambridge, has also taken an apartment
in New York separate from her husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Weld has told friends his marriage has suffered as a result of
his active social life, including his dating relationship with a
writer for a celebrity magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor has said Mrs. Weld, a quiet academic who
specializes in ancient Chinese law, is uncomfortable with his New
York friends and his frequent dining out at chic Manhattan
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While Weld, a managing partner for McDermott, Will, &AMP; Emery,
maintains an apartment on Carnegie Hill, on New York's upper East
Side, his wife rents a separate residence in midtown. Mrs. Weld is
also spending several days of the week in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Weld did not return phone calls Thursday. Mrs. Weld could not be
reached. In previous interviews with the Globe, Weld has not spoken
directly about their marital status, but has alluded to his wife's
lack of enthusiasm for his New York lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year, according to sources, the former governor
began dating Leslie Marshall, who lives in his apartment building.
Marshall is a contributing editor covering fashion, movies, and
celebrities for In Style Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the Welds' marital strain, buzzed about in Boston
political circles for months, emerged publicly Thursday in a New
York Post gossip column, which reported that Weld was dating a
journalist in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor has told associates he and his wife do not
plan to divorce. ``Nobody is talking to lawyers,'' he recently told
one source.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to New York, Weld, who declared in a recent
interview that he was a mere ``carpetbagger'' while in
Massachusetts, has been a rumored potential candidate for governor
or for U.S. Senate from New York. Last month he told the Globe he
is ``having too much fun'' in the private sector to consider
political office right now.
</P>
<P>
   Weld has not kept in close touch with his friends in Boston,
including those in the political world who worked with him during
his years in office, from 1991 to 1997. But his career and musings
about future plans _ from writing novels to a possible return to
public office _ are closely followed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Globe last week, however, Weld declined
direct comment when asked about the widespread reports of troubles
in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But he did say that while he lived full time in Manhattan, his
wife was in New York only about two-fifths of the time. He said he
is in Boston about every two weeks, but just for quick visits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would comment on widespread reports of discord in
his marriage, Weld replied: ``No.'' Then, choosing his words with
care, he added: ``I think it has been harder for Sue-Sue to make
the switch to a New York base professionally than I had
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld has also spoken about his active social life in New York.
``It is true that I've become an inveterate lover of fine
restaurants,'' he said. ``I have an active social life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welds, both New York natives, were married in 1975 in Oyster
Bay, on Long Island.

REAGAN, O'NEILL URGED US PEACE ROLE IN ULSTER, DOCUMENTS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Ronald Reagan and Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. conspired to advance the cause of peace in
Northern Ireland at a key juncture in 1984, pressing British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to recognize an American and Irish role
in the affairs of the troubled province, newly-released documents
show.
</P>
<P>
   According to Reagan White House papers, which were part of more
than 10,000 pages released to The Boston Globe by his presidential
library under the US Freedom of Information Act, the former
president was persuaded by a personal appeal by the late House
Speaker to make a private approach to Thatcher, the world leader
with whom Reagan had his closest personal and ideological ties.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also shed new light on Reagan's personality and
private sense of ethnic identity; offer tantalizing glimpses into
the hidden world of high-level diplomacy, and add detail and
texture to the former president's relationships with Thatcher and
O'Neill, his foremost domestic political foe.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the O'Neill-Reagan diplomatic maneuver, detailed in
public for the first time by the newly-released papers, has been
confirmed for the Globe in interviews with Reagan's top White House
aides; former staffers to O'Neill, and Irish diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to personally share with you my deep concern,'' O'Neill
wrote Reagan on Dec. 13, 1984. ``The best hope for a peaceful,
lawful and constitutional resolution to the tragedy of Northern
Ireland may be in serious jeopardy as a result of Mrs. Thatcher's
public statements.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Thatcher at the presidential retreat at Camp
David on Dec. 22, Reagan replied to the speaker on Jan. 9, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a special effort to bring your letter to her personal
attention and to convey your message of concern,'' Reagan wrote.
``I also personally emphasized the need for progress in resolving
the complex situation in Northern Ireland, and the desirability for
flexibility on the part of all the involved parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher, who had lost close friends and been personally
targeted by Irish Republican Army terrorist attacks, bent to
Reagan's private appeals. In their Camp David discussions, she
promised to renew diplomatic talks with Irish Prime Minister Garret
FitzGerald, Reagan informed O'Neill. In November 1985, the Irish
and British leaders signed the landmark Anglo-Irish agreement,
recognizing an Irish role in the affairs of the troubled North.
</P>
<P>
   The library files demonstrate how Reagan _ fresh off a
sentimental trip to his ancestral home of Ballyporeen in Ireland in
the summer of 1984 _ chose to overcome the pro-British leanings of
the US State Department. They also reveal how _ in the never-ending
scheming for political advantage in Washington _ members of
Reagan's staff sought to mute O'Neill's opposition to US funding
for the Nicaraguan Contra armies by appeasing the speaker on
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped to use this as a lever against `Tip' in order to get
Contra aide moving,'' wrote one official from Reagan's National
Security Council, in a September 1986 memo.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan papers show how O'Neill, at one point, sweetened the
deal by agreeing to give Thatcher a coveted opportunity to address
a joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   And the documents also detail how O'Neill, along with Senators
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, and former New York governor Hugh Carey _ who were known as
``the Four Horsemen'' _ played a critical role at channeling
Irish-American sentiment toward constructive purposes, thus
undercutting support for the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Working with moderate political leaders in Ireland, Northern
Ireland, and the United States, and advised by Irish diplomats and
Northern Ireland's Nobel Prize recipient John Hume, O'Neill and his
colleagues helped establish the precedent for US involvement in
Anglo-Irish affairs that President Clinton and envoy George
Mitchell have employed in the current peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intervention by Reagan was vital, and it was made possible
by Tip,'' said Sean Donlon, the former Irish ambassador to the
United States. The speaker's efforts in the late 1970s and early
1980s were the beginning of a process that Clinton then ``advanced
. . . to a whole new phase,'' Donlon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Horsemen had their first success in the late 1970s when
they prevailed upon Reagan's predecessor, former president Jimmy
Carter, to proclaim an American interest in the affairs of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   After Reagan was elected in November 1980, however, the US
foreign policy establishment reverted to its traditional stance:
that the United States should not anger Great Britain, its closest
Cold War ally, by meddling in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and O'Neill were rebuffed in their first approach to
Reagan, in the spring of 1981, when they asked the president to
press Thatcher to compromise with dying IRA hunger strikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intense media coverage of the hunger strike in the United
States has dramatically improved the image of the Provisional IRA
among 35 million Irish-Americans and reversed a five-year trend of
declining financial support of the IRA,'' O'Neill wrote Reagan on
May 19, 1981. ``Members of the IRA are terrorists and should be
treated as such. But by refusing to negotiate regarding prison
rules, Mrs. Thatcher is permitting the terrorists to undo
significant political progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a promise that he kept to his death, O'Neill assured
Reagan that he would keep any informal negotiations a secret, and
asked the president to make ``a private and discreet expression of
concern'' to the prime minister. But Reagan declined to appeal to
Thatcher, and refused to meet with members of Congress on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little to be gained by such a meeting,'' his national
security adviser, Richard V. Allen, wrote to presidential aide Ed
Meese. Allen was more upset at the verbal ``harassment'' that
Irish-American demonstrators were giving British diplomats in the
United States. He demanded that Meese send letters to the top
police officials in Boston and New York, requesting better
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is intolerable that the representatives of our staunchest
ally in the world are subjected to this sort of treatment,'' Allen
wrote Meese, on Aug. 27, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   As the hunger strikers died, Reagan and O'Neill were waging
their historic tax and budget battle over the size and role of
American government. But despite their heated rhetorical volleys,
the two men, for both personal and practical political reasons,
never allowed their relationship to completely deteriorate. A
shared fondness for funny stories and other things Irish served as
an important bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1981, Reagan gave a private birthday lunch for
O'Neill at the White House. Calling for a bottle of champagne, the
president toasted the speaker's health saying, ``Tip, if I had a
ticket to heaven and you didn't have one too, I would give mine
away and go to hell with you.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aide Michael Deaver recalled ``It was an old Irish
toast Reagan had heard somewhere. Tip's eyes were all filled up and
they left the dining room with their arms around each other's waist
and Reagan took him down to the elevator . . . and Tip went out to
the South Lawn and beat the hell out of Reagan with the press.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, O'Neill gave no quarter. Privately, he wrote Reagan
to thank him for ``a birthday I will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, meanwhile, was cultivating another friend in Thatcher,
who endorsed the president's arms buildup and muscular approach
toward the Soviet Union and was attempting to match Reagan's
attempts to trim back government with her own conservative
revolution in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with you on our girl Margaret,'' Reagan wrote the US
Ambassador to Great Britain, Charles H. Price, in his
characteristic squiggly handwriting. If the British public ``turn
away from her, they may well have thrown away their last chance,''
Reagan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   When Thatcher journeyed to Washington in 1983, Reagan rebuffed
O'Neill's requests to add Ireland to the agenda. And in May 1984,
when Hume and his Irish counterparts released the report of a
diplomatic effort called the New Irish Forum, which called for an
Anglo-Irish agreement, Reagan aide Peter Sommer wrote to his boss,
national security adviser Robert C. McFarlane that ``State and I
had earlier agreed that it would be inappropriate to draw the White
House into the middle of this complex, historical problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be very frank, I don't think we should allow ourselves to
be used by the Irish; particularly since the Irish have not been
especially supportive of our interests on such issues as Central
America,'' Sommer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But by now O'Neill had an important ally in the administration:
former judge William Clark, who served as national security adviser
and then Secretary of the Interior, and took a personal interest in
Irish affairs. Clark worked with Kennedy and O'Neill and their
staffs, and provided an important countervoice to the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher agreed to discuss the findings of the New Irish Forum
with FitzGerald, but then she narrowly escaped death when the IRA
bombed her Conservative Party's conference in October 1984. At a
famous press conference following talks with FitzGerald that
November, she curtly dismissed three compromise proposals to give
the Irish a greater a voice in Northern Ireland's affairs as ``out
. . . out . . .out.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's adamant stand set the stage for O'Neill's
Dec. 13 letter, which was followed by one or more private
conversations between the speaker and Reagan, and the
Reagan-Thatcher Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving office, Thatcher expressed disappointment in the
results of the subsequent Anglo-Irish Agreement, which she signed
in November 1985, on a day when a beaming Reagan and O'Neill
appeared together at the White House to hail the deal. American,
Irish, and Northern Irish leaders have since credited the agreement
as a crucial stage-setter for Clinton's involvement and the current
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Reagan and Thatcher bend to O'Neill's request?
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's rediscovery of his Irish roots, and his years of
swapping stories with the Speaker, certainly played a role, said
Deaver. Nor could Reagan and Thatcher fail to appreciate that
O'Neill was taking a political risk. The Irish-American community
in Boston and New York and other large cities was split between
moderates and militants. The British recognized the difficult role
O'Neill and the other Horsemen had taken.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an extraordinary 12-page letter to Reagan, the
indefatigable advocate for the Irish republican cause, Paul O'Dwyer
of New York, condemned O'Neill for making ``politically-motivated
pronouncements'' which ``transferred the blame for the violence in
Northern Ireland from the British occupation forces and placed it
squarely on the shoulders of the Northern Ireland victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's own political instincts and advisers told her she had
gone too far with her ``out . . . out . . . out'' remarks. And,
hoping to follow in the footsteps of her Conservative Party hero,
Winston Churchill, she coveted something O'Neill could convey: the
honor of addressing the US Congress in joint session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such an occasion would be the highlight of her visit,''
British ambassador Oliver Wright wrote the speaker. Thatcher
addressed the Congress on her next trip to Washington, on Feb. 20,
1985, and met with O'Neill for an hour that afternoon.

MORE HMOS CUTTING BACK PARTICIPATION IN MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., R.I.)  (EDS NOTE: This is now a story on the Times front page. In 12th
graf, replace (plus) with addition sign in name of health plan:
Medicare(plus)Choice) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health maintenance organizations will cancel
insurance coverage for more than 700,000 Medicare beneficiaries
next year because the HMOs are cutting back their participation in
Medicare, an industry trade group announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the trade group, the American
Association of Health Plans, said the H: :"were pulling out of
numerous counties because they had been ``over-regulated and
underps.
</P>
<P>
   Many elderly people joined HMOs to get outpatient drug benefits,
but they may lose those benefits when they are forced out of HMOs.
The beneficiaries can return to Medicare's original fee-for-service
program, or they can try to find another HMO. But there is no
guarantee that other health plans will be available or have the
capacity to take them.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare, a unit of Aetna Inc., one of the largest
managed care companies, told the Clinton administration on Thursday
that it was dropping more than half of its 659,000 Medicare
beneficiaries in 14 states. The cutbacks will affect a total of
355,000 people, including 36,629 in New York state, 14,780 in
Connecticut, 134,324 in Texas, 52,331 in Ohio, 47,670 in Florida,
18,650 in Pennsylvania and 15,283 in California.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions by HMOs to withdraw from Medicare are relevant to
the debate in Congress over how to provide prescription drug
benefits to people on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 217-214, the House on Wednesday passed a bill under
which the government would pay subsidies to insurance companies to
get them to offer drug benefits to the elderly. Democratic members
of Congress repeatedly said that private companies could not be
trusted to provide stable, reliable drug benefits, and they cited
the volatile Medicare HMO market to support their contention.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Weygand, D-R.I., said he had just received a letter
from United Healthcare, saying it would pull out of the Medicare
market in Bristol County, R.I. Weygand said he feared that
insurance companies would, in a similar way, stop offering drug
benefits, as proposed under the House Republican plan, if the
business became unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris John, D-La., said the last HMO in his district had
just announced that it was pulling out of the Medicare managed care
program, known as Medicare(plus)Choice. ``The Republican
prescription drug plan would privatize drug coverage in the same
manner that Medicare(plus)Choice privatized health care services''
for the elderly, John said. ``And this plan, too, is doomed to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans said Thursday that any legislation adding
drug benefits to Medicare should be tied to larger changes in the
program, intended to control costs and promote competition.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Finance Committee, Sen. William V. Roth Jr.,
R-Del., said he hoped the panel would approve a Medicare bill next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats said they doubted that Roth could muster a
consensus. They said that a deal on drug benefits might be arranged
this fall through high-level negotiations between President
Clinton, House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois and Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said the administration was concerned to see HMOs again
dropping large numbers of Medicare beneficiaries. ``It is
regrettable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation Health Systems, based in Los Angeles, said on
Thursday that it would discontinue its Medicare HMO operations in
parts of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Arizona, California and
Pennsylvania. The cutbacks will affect 19,000 people, or 7 percent
of the 259,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the company's health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Cigna Corp., said earlier this month that it would end
coverage for 104,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 states, including
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Donaldson, the chairman of Aetna Inc., said, ``The
decision to exit certain Medicare markets was reached with great
reluctance.'' But, he said, ``inadequate government reimbursements
have made operating a number of our Medicare HMOs no longer
viable.''

STOCK PRICES FALL AS SOME COMPANIES REPORT LOWER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell broadly Thursday as several
prominent companies warned of lower-than-expected profits and the
government reported that the economy grew faster than originally
thought in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of telecommunications and computer-networking companies
were among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq composite index, which
pulled out of an early swoon but slid again after lunch and closed
with a loss of 63.11 points, or 1.6 percent, to 3,877.23.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, the biggest maker of equipment for wireless phones,
cast a pall over the market by cautioning that the industry's
growth might be held back by consumer resistance to higher prices _
reflecting, among other things, government fees for licenses.
Shares in the company fell 1], to 18 11-16, and Alcatel, Nokia and
Qualcomm also slumped. A PaineWebber analyst cut his target price
for Qualcomm to 200 over the next year from 250. Shares of Qualcomm
fell 2 1/16, to 61{.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless is sort of polluting the environment,'' said Hank
Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129.75 points, or 1.2
percent, to 10,398.04, swelling the loss so far this year to 9.6
percent, about twice that of the Nasdaq. Twenty of the 30
components fell, led by J.P. Morgan and Hewlett-Packard, which each
fell about 4 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index declined 12.43 points, or
0.85 percent, to 1,442.39, with 309 of its components lower
compared with 178 that were higher. The index is down 1.83 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation fears weighed on the market after the Commerce
Department increased the figure for first-quarter growth in gross
domestic product to 5.5 percent from 5.4 percent, adding to
uneasiness that the Federal Reserve may decide to raise interest
rates again when it meets in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more inflation than we thought,'' said Douglas R.
Cliggott, a top strategist at J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   But drug stocks bucked the downtrend, paced by Eli Lilly, which
soared to its biggest gain in at least 20 years after it said its
experimental sepsis drug, Zovant, showed promise in reducing
deaths. The stock gained 15[, to 102\, after trading as high as
109.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies that warned of lower earnings, some two dozen
over the last two days, included Unisys, which tumbled 9 1/16, to
14 9/16; Goodyear Tire and Rubber, down 2[, to 21\; and SCM
Microsystems, which dropped 35 11-16, to 53|.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of empathy for earnings shortfalls'' said
Andrew M. Brooks, chief stock trader at T. Rowe Price.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a tabulation by IBES International, which tracks
forecasts, suggested that second-quarter profit reports over the
summer would not prove disappointing over all.
</P>
<P>
   Just 65.8 percent of so-called pre-announcements have been
negative, said Joseph S. Kalinowski, the equity strategist at IBES,
compared with an average of 84 percent for the quarter since 1996.
The difference, he suggested, is that this year there has been a
bunching of announcements by high-profile companies.
</P>
<P>
   Recent weakness of the dollar against the euro and the yen,
analysts said, not only may have contributed to some of the
shortfalls but has added to general inflation pressure.
</P>
<P>
   With consumer prices other than food and energy likely to be
topping 3 percent, Cliggott said, ``I think it makes sense to be
pretty cautious'' about stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the Big Board edged up to 1.11 billion shares from
1.07 billion on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks overseas were decidedly lower in most major markets _
about 3 percent in Paris, 2.5 percent in Frankfurt and Sao Paulo,
and 1 percent in London and Hong Kong. Stocks rose less than 1
percent in Tokyo. &QL;

ISRAELI AIRCRAFT MAKER RUNS AFOUL OF U.S. WITH CHINA RADAR
CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOD, Israel _ Behind a tarpaulin-covered fence at the far edge
of the Israel Aircraft Industries complex at Ben-Gurion
International Airport here sits a refurbished Russian transport,
its saucer-like radar pod temporarily removed for fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, company officials say, the pod will be back, the
radar switched on, and the distinctive droop-winged jet ready for
its final test flights. The plane, a transformed Ilyushin-76, will
be able to monitor air and telecommunications traffic more than 200
miles away _ the specifications ordered by the plane's owner, the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   For Israel Aircraft Industries' president, Moshe Keret, who over
the last 15 years has built a virtually bankrupt military
contractor into Israel's biggest exporter, the sale was to have
been one his greatest achievements. The Phalcon early-warning radar
system installed on the Chinese plane showcased all the strengths
of IAI _ as the state-owned company is known _ its technological
prowess and its success in developing new markets abroad to help
pay for Israel's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Pentagon has its way _ and the betting here is that
it will _ the converted Ilyushin will never reach China, which long
ago gave Israel Aircraft the down payment on the $250 million spy
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, President Clinton reiterated Washington's concern that
China could use the radar system against U.S. forces in the Taiwan
Strait. Earlier in the week, the House Appropriations Committee
called on Israel to terminate the deal, with many members pledging
to cut Israel's aid if it does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We signed a contract,'' a top official of Israel Aircraft
said. ``We have their money. Now we say, `No, sorry?'''
</P>
<P>
   To foreign policy analysts, the Phalcon dispute is an
illustration of how Israeli-U.S. strategic ties are still often
frayed by miscommunication and mistrust on both sides _ as well as
by rare but deep divergences in each country's conception of its
national interest. The China contract has opened the first
significant rift between the Clinton administration and the
government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, just as both governments
are trying to persuade the Palestinians to join them in Washington
for a conclusive round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But to Keret, 65, who has worked at Israel Aircraft his entire
adult life, the conflict is also a potential business catastrophe,
one that he thinks directly threatens his company's prospects for
survival in an increasingly competitive and consolidated global
arms industry.
</P>
<P>
   A threat to Israel Aircraft's future is seen by many Israeli
leaders as a threat to the nation, both militarily and
economically. The company, founded in 1953, is the centerpiece of a
domestic arms and aeronautics industry that Israel considers the
key to its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about the Phalcon per se,'' said Keret,
who has been asked by the government not to comment on the deal, at
IAI headquarters here. ``But what is the environment in which we
are operating? It is very competitive. Although we are a
state-owned company, we get no subsidy, and no favoritism from the
defense ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Boeing and other behemoths of the global defense
trade, Israel Aircraft is no giant: Its $1 billion in foreign
military sales puts it about 30th among major arms sellers abroad,
according to independent assessments. Overall sales reached $2
billion last year, two-thirds from military contracts and the rest
from commercial aircraft production and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to overstate the company's importance to
Israel. With 14,000 skilled workers, Israel Aircraft is by far the
country's biggest industrial employer, comparable in U.S. terms to
General Motors and General Electric combined. A further 15,000
Israeli jobs are indirectly dependent on the company. And its $1.6
billion in military and commercial sales abroad make it the biggest
exporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a disaster in IAI for one reason or another,''
Keret said, ``its effects would be felt throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A certain disaster for the company would be any significant
erosion of U.S. aid. IAI has been the biggest beneficiary of U.S.
rules permitting a quarter of military assistance to be spent in
Israel _ for purchases of arms produced in this country. Yet Moshe
Arens, a three-time former defense minister, whose views are widely
shared here, said this week that $2 billion in annual military aid
is ``not sufficient to make us start accepting U.S. control over
defense industry exports.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials seem mystified that Israel would jeopardize its
critical international alliance by pursuing what appears to be a
marginal weapons deal. Last fall, as the China controversy broke
into the open, the same Israeli officials who were defending the
Phalcon sale were presenting Washington with a $17 billion wish
list of arms they said the country needed to compensate for the
then-expected turnover of the Golan Heights to Syria. Now the
Israelis are discussing a similar military aid package to safeguard
a peace pact with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have tried to explain to Israelis that Americans cannot
understand why Israel was refusing to give up $250 million when it
was asking the United States for $17 billion,'' said David
Makovsky, who has been an Israeli analyst at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
   But far more than $250 million is at stake, say Israeli leaders.
``We'll do our utmost to act sensitively and to be attentive to
U.S. interests,'' Barak, who appoints Israel Aircraft's board,
said. ``At the same time, there's a contract with China, signed
during the incumbency of the previous government. The state doesn't
call off contracts to which it is a signatory just like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even seen narrowly, the contract with China is potentially a $2
billion deal, huge by Israel Aircraft standards. Under terms
negotiated three years ago, Beijing has options to buy seven more
Phalcon-equipped Ilyushins. Fulfilling such a contract would
catapult the company into an elite fraternity of major contractors
in bidding for such systems _ and it would subsidize further
technological advances at home. Though Israel Aircraft lost to
Boeing in a recent bid to supply early-warning planes to Australia,
it is competing for a $2 billion contract in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Worse, executives say, the cancellation of the contract would be
a signal to potential customers that no deal with Israel Aircraft
is final, as the United States could effectively veto a promised
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to buy from the Europeans,'' a gloomy executive said.
Or perhaps from the Russians, who supplied destroyers, cruise
missiles and other heavy weaponry to the Chinese over the last
decade with few protests from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as others here cynically suggest, from the Americans
themselves. Israelis point to the continuing export of advanced
military technology to China by the United States in the last
decade: Since the ban by Congress in 1989 on military sales to
Beijing, after the crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square, the White House has issued waivers for some $300 million in
exports of satellite and encryption equipment to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the United States did not renege on its own deals,
Israelis note, fulfilling $36 million in orders placed by China
before the ban, including anti-artillery radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last week, the newspaper Maariv decried what it
called ``Washington's attempts to torpedo the deal and sabotage
Israel's defense exports, perhaps out of the desire to protect the
interests of giant U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Maariv, like other leading media voices here, concluded that
Israel would have little choice but to renege on the contract.
Until the dispute is resolved, another daily, Haaretz, said, ``The
Phalcon will continue to be a sword of Damocles hanging over
Israel's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Keret seems surprised by the furor in Washington over the
Phalcon deal. Until newspapers here published photos of the plane
late last year, setting off the American outcry, company executives
say they considered the contract old news.
</P>
<P>
   When the company bid for the contract in 1996, Israel officially
notified the United States that the Phalcon system did not
incorporate protected U.S. technology, a contention the Pentagon
has never challenged. Though Washington officials say they objected
to the sale on strategic and human rights grounds, there were no
public complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, calling for delivery beginning in 2000, was concluded
in highly publicized trips to Moscow and Beijing by then-Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
In April 1998, the Phalcon sale was reported to Congress in a
General Accounting Office review of recent Chinese arms purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Again, there were no public U.S. protests, though officials say
they tried to dissuade Israel from signing. ``As the deal went
forward, they weren't hearing us anymore,'' a senior State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. companies were prohibited from selling radar planes
to China after the events there in June 1989, Israel Aircraft
considered this a commercial opportunity. In the first foreign sale
of its airborne radar, it sent a Phalcon-equipped Boeing 767 to
Chile, which was then prohibited by Congressional strictures from
buying Boeing Awacs surveillance planes. Washington raised no
objections, Keret said.
</P>
<P>
   From Central America in the 1980s to Turkey in the 1990s, the
company provided other military equipment to countries where U.S.
exports were constrained by human rights considerations.
</P>
<P>
   And in China, Israel Aircraft was hardly alone. Competitors in
Italy and Britain were both offering advanced airborne radar
systems to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has since become more worried by Beijing's
conflict with Taiwan, and officials are telling the Israeli
contractor that no company so dependent on U.S. trade and aid can
consider itself geopolitically autonomous.
</P>
<P>
   By design, Keret has made Israel Aircraft increasingly reliant
on the United States as a market, supplier and business partner,
creating joint ventures with all the major aerospace companies. And
through its own U.S. subsidiaries _ including its Galaxy corporate
jet business, based in Fort Worth _ the company says it spends
about $400 million yearly in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With such partners, the company specializes in upgrading U.S.
aircraft for foreign air forces _ and even for the United States
Air Force, which recently awarded Israel Aircraft and Boeing a $400
million contract to revamp 450 of its T-38 Talon trainers. The
small unmanned planes, an IAI specialty, proved a key
reconnaissance weapon for the U.S. Army in Kosovo, prompting other
NATO orders.
</P>
<P>
   In its most ambitious U.S. joint venture, Israel Aircraft is the
principal contractor on the Arrow, a $2 billion
anti-ballistic-missile system deployed here this year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. support has been critical to the company's turnaround.
After weathering a worldwide plunge in military sales in the
mid-1990s, it has stayed in the black for 14 consecutive quarters.
Net profit last year rose to $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Boeing and Lockheed Martin heed the Pentagon before
pursuing foreign arms deals, so now must Israel Aircraft, many
officials of this country reluctantly conclude.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Israel Aircraft tried to buck the Pentagon and its
military contractors, Keret painfully recalls, it almost destroyed
the company. The project was his baby: IAI's own jet fighter, the
Lavi, envisioned as a successor _ and competitor _ to the Air
Force's F-16. The increasingly expensive project was canceled under
pressure from Washington in 1987, just a year after the Lavi's
maiden flight. The move wiped out 5,000 jobs and nearly propelled
Israel Aircraft into receivership.
</P>
<P>
   Keret is credited with rescuing the company from the Lavi
debacle. The radar and navigation and missile-guidance systems
developed for the Lavi were refined into independent products, many
of them now installed on IAI-refurbished F-16s.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sits in his corporate offices in Lod, which are still
decorated with models and photographs of the extinct Israeli
fighter, Keret says he regrets the loss of corporate and national
independence that the Lavi symbolized. ``It was a good plane,'' he
said. ``I'm sure we could have sold a lot of them.''

 &HT;    No charges filed against owner of gun used to shoot Florida
teacher
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No charges will be filed against the
75-year-old man who owned the gun used to shoot middle school
teacher Barry Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   The gun was not stored loaded and 13-year-old Nathaniel Brazill
stole the gun from a drawer in Elmore McCray's bedroom, police and
the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office concluded. The boy
later used the gun to kill Grunow, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, which were released Thursday, mean that McCray
cannot be charged with either the misdemeanor or a felony version
of failing to keep a firearm secure from minors. To be charged with
either crime, Florida law requires that the gun be loaded. The law
also exempts gun owners whose weapon is stolen.
</P>
<P>
   McCray could not be reached for comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill, who is charged with first-degree murder in the May 26
shooting, as well as McCray and four people who live with McCray
gave similar accounts to police about the .25-caliber Raven
semi-automatic used to kill the English teacher at Lake Worth
Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Brazill told police several times that he took
the gun from McCray's bedroom and loaded it himself.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Brazill took the gun when he stayed
several days at McCray's home while his mother was in South
Carolina. McCray's daughter is Brazill's godmother. The teen
sometimes visited and called McCray by the name ``Grand.''
</P>
<P>
   McCray told police he kept the gun in a desk drawer in a holiday
Oreo cookie tin. The ammunition was in a box in the tin, according
to a transcript of the police interview with McCray.
</P>
<P>
   McCray said he was given the gun about seven years ago by a
woman whose husband had died. She didn't want the gun in the house
because her son was involved in drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCray kept the gun unloaded `` 'cause I didn't want no loaded
gun in my house,'' he told police.
</P>
<P>
   He took the gun out only on New Year's Eve. While kids were in
the front yard shooting off fireworks, he said he would fire two
rounds into pine trees in his back yard to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   He said Brazill and other family members may have known that he
owned the gun from the celebration. McCray's 7-year-old great
granddaughter knew he owned a gun but did not know where it was
kept, she told police.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter, Luvenia Corbin, said the gun was kept unloaded and
James McGill, a friend who also lived there, said he didn't know
where it was kept. McCray's son, Willie Mack McCray said he didn't
know his father had obtained a gun since another had been stolen in
the 1970s.

NO GUNS BLAZING, JUST IDEAS ON FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Here it is, the biggest party of the year, and they
cluster together off to the side: the members of the chess team,
the guys from the audiovisual club, future physics majors with
thick glasses and pocket protectors. Just what are they doing in
this room full of quarterbacks and cheerleaders? Who invited them
to the party?
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, the major Hollywood studios unleash their biggest,
loudest and most expensive and star-studded films into a world of
vacationing families and entertainment-hungry teen-agers. Tom
Cruise hangs from impossible cliffs. Mel Gibson skewers sneering
Brits. Jim Carrey rides the wild highway. The rules are simple:
Cars exist to be chased, guns to be fired, affairs to be
consummated, rockets to be launched. Special effects blossom like
wildflowers on the prairie. Have sequel, will travel.
</P>
<P>
   But off to the side, clustered together, are a growing number of
smaller, less heralded movies _ independent features, foreign
films, this year's quirky Shakespeare adaptations _ that somehow
find themselves battling it out in the nation's theaters with the
big Hollywood quarterbacks. In these movies, cars exist to be
driven, guns to be deplored, affairs to be analyzed. And rockets?
Well, there are no rockets. Have subtitles, will travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be, five or six years ago, that the indies would
stay out of the summer because of the major studio films,'' said
Amir Malin, the chairman of Artisan Entertainment. ``But now, with
the success that we and others have had in recent years, that's no
longer true.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the independent films being released has shifted
as well. While still offering standard literary adaptations and
films by celebrated foreign directors, many distributors have tried
to use the summer as a springboard for darker and quirkier movies
aimed at a younger audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This summer we've got two comedies, both alternative, both
hip,'' Malin said. ``That's what we like to present to summer
audiences: counterprogramming to what exists from the major
studios.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just films for hipsters that the art houses are
offering this summer. They are screening foreign epics,
character-driven dramas, absurdist satires. ``The thing to
emphasize is that films like ours go up against Hollywood 52 weeks
of the year,'' said Mark Urman, a co-president of Lions Gate Films.
``In fact, the summer is for us a great time. It's the time when
Hollywood becomes more mindless than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   During the fall and holiday seasons, the Oscar-hungry Hollywood
studios put out their prestige films, and there are more movies in
the marketplace competing with specialized films from
independent-minded distributors like Lions Gate, Miramax, Sony
Pictures Classics, Artisan, Fine Line, Paramount Classics, Fox
Searchlight, USA Films and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the darker, colder months, films that reach more
sophisticated or more mature moviegoers simply stop selling tickets
at a certain hour,'' Urman said. ``Our audiences go home and watch
Charlie Rose and retire, or whatever they do. But in the summer,
there is such a vacuum of films of ideas, films of emotions, that
we have always looked upon summer as an extraordinary opportunity
to have a genuine impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some of the biggest hits released by independent
distributors in recent years have come out during the summer: ``Il
Postino'' in 1994, ``Trainspotting'' in 1996, ``The Full Monty'' in
1997 and, of course, ``The Blair Witch Project'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guiding principle on this is that my mother needs something
to see,'' said Mark Gill, the president of Miramax's Los Angeles
office. ``It's kind of a joke, but it's true as well. The art
audience is driven by educated women, middle-aged and up, who want
to see movies that do not have big explosions in them.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as four summers ago, Gill said, 26 films opened in
American theaters between mid-May and Labor Day that could be
classified as independent or foreign films _ movies given limited
releases, usually beginning in New York and Los Angeles and, if
they clicked, gradually appearing in an increasing number of cities
until no college town was left untouched. For the last two or three
years, though, the numbers have shot up to 70 or 75 such films.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened was that there was an explosion of success at
the Academy Awards in 1996, when four of the five films nominated
for best picture were from independent distributors,'' Gill said.
``It was evident there was a marvelous business there, if you could
be successful at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, all distributors seem to agree, has been a glut. It
is not just your imagination: there are more movie reviews in the
paper because there are more and more of these small,
limited-release films. While many of the companies that began the
independent-film trend in the early 1990s have since given up the
ghost, victims of the pitiless economics of a fickle industry, a
few have hung on and prospered, and others have merged into larger
companies. At the same time, the major Hollywood studios have
gotten into the game, either by buying out the independent
companies (like Disney's acquisition of Miramax) or starting their
own in-house classics division (like Sony Pictures Classics, Fox
Searchlight and, most recently, Paramount Classics).
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there has not been substantial growth in
the size of the audience,'' Gill said. ``Even films that are
successful must make do with less.''
</P>
<P>
   So while new companies enter the market, others are putting out
fewer films, and there is general agreement that the current pace _
70 or 75 small films coming out every summer _ won't keep up
forever. ``It can't last because so many of them are not
succeeding,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps people going is that, first, a small film doesn't
have to be a mass-audience hit to turn a profit; it can make do
with less. ``We can make $1.5 million on a film, and it doesn't
sound like a lot of money, compared to the big studio movies, but
in our world, it's a success,'' said David Dinerstein, a
co-president of Paramount Classics. And if it somehow does click
and, like ``Full Monty'' or ``Blair Witch,'' cross over into a
mainstream audience, the profits are amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Red Violin,' we had a movie that spoke to a certain
audience that is underserved in the summer,'' Urman said. ``It made
$10 million. I know that by certain standards, that can be one
Saturday for a Tom Cruise movie. But by independent film standards,
that's a breakout; that's a crossover success. And it's not
necessary for our kind of films to satisfy everyone. In fact, it is
intrinsic in their design that they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The other factor in the success of a smaller film is that it is,
by definition, not released in the same way as a big summer movie.
For something like ``Dinosaur'' or ``The Perfect Storm,'' thousands
of prints are put into thousands of theaters all over the country,
and millions of dollars are spent on marketing campaigns to ensure
a huge opening weekend. Smaller films are released more gradually,
beginning in the largest markets, then spreading slowly. If the
film finds its audience, it can run through the entire summer. A
big Hollywood movie, even a substantial success, can substantially
burn out in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Granata, president for publicity and corporate
communications at Miramax, said that instead of spending a lot of
money to generate excitement over one huge opening, smaller
distributors must stage a series of small-scale openings, each week
trying to attract the attention of a new crop of local critics and
talk show hosts. ``We call it sticking to the knitting,'' Granata
said. ``You treat the opening in Boston as if it were a national
opening. The local, grass-roots effort becomes very, very
primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Miramax's ``Hamlet,'' for instance _ the version starring Ethan
Hawke and set in modern-day Manhattan _ opened on May 12 in New
York and Los Angeles. The next week, it expanded to the top 10
cities. On May 26, it went to the top 20 cities and, on June 9, to
the top 40. In recent weeks, it began to expand into the larger
college towns, like New Haven. ``You hope for 16 to 20 weeks in
theaters,'' Gill said. ``It used to be you could count on that. But
it's so much more competitive now. So few of these movies are
successful, it's just ridiculous.''

CLINTON PICKS FORMER CONGRESSMAN TO BE COMMERCE SECRETARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (CORRECTS ``of'' to ``around'' in 2nd graf)  
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday nominated a former
congressman, Norman Mineta, as secretary of commerce for the final
six months of his presidency, laying the groundwork for Mineta to
become the first Asian-American to hold a Cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta, a Democrat, retired from the House in 1995 after 21
years representing the area around San Jose, Calif. He had been
chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, and
resigned in 1995 to become a senior vice president at Lockheed
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Mineta would replace William Daley,
who will formally step down on July 15 to become campaign chairman
for Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid. He would be
Clinton's fourth commerce secretary, following Mickey Kantor and
the late Ron Brown, as well as Daley.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta is 68. During World War II, when he was 10, his family
was loaded onto a train and taken to an internment camp in Wyoming
for Americans of Japanese descent. Years later, as a lawmaker,
Mineta helped pass legislation granting $20,000 in compensation to
every Japanese-American who had been interned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm Mineta's family story tells a lot about the promise of
the American dream and the power of one person's devotion to
opportunity and to justice,'' Clinton said in announcing the
selection Thursday morning in the Oval Office. Along with Mineta,
the president was joined by Daley and Robert Mallett, the deputy
commerce secretary, who had been a finalist for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination brought immediate praise from Asian-American
organizations. One side benefit of the selection, in the view of
administration officials, is that it may help blunt criticism from
Asian-Americans that followed the firing of Wen Ho Lee, the
government scientist accused of mishandling secrets at the Los
Alamos National Laboratory. Some Asian-Americans have also
expressed unhappiness over the scrutiny people of Asian descent
have faced during the investigations of campaign fund-raising
abuses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will go a long way toward bridging the divide,''
Mineta said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta acknowledged that, even with a quick confirmation, his
time in Clinton's Cabinet would be short. But he said that he was
not taking the job as a caretaker, and that he believed the
Commerce Department would remain active until the very end of the
president's term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some might say that the months remaining in this
administration is not a lot of time to make a difference in the
life of our nation,'' Mineta said. ``But I disagree. Six months is
a virtual eternity in the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mineta's decision to leave the House to go into private business
with a year to go in his term, and just 10 months after Republicans
seized control of Congress, rankled some of his Democratic
colleagues at the time. A Republican, Rep. Tom Campbell, won
Mineta's seat in a special election. Key Republican senators and
supporters predicted a quick confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who will do very well in the sprint to the
end,'' said Tom Donahue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
``He knows Congress well, and they know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some union leaders also praised Mineta, saying their main
concern with him was his support for the Clinton Administration's
free trade agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody, however, was enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his congressional voting record is any measure, he's
clearly out of touch with small business,'' said Nelson Litterst, a
spokesman for the National Federation for Independent Business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a considerable salary increase when he went into the
private sector, Mineta had clearly not turned his back entirely on
politics. He served as an informal adviser to Gore's presidential
effort and had recently considered a run for his old seat in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second time Mineta had been offered a Cabinet post,
he said. In 1992, President-elect Clinton considered Mineta for
transportation secretary, and Mineta said Thursday that he had been
offered the job but turned it down. He was about to become a
committee chairman, and thought he could assist his party more in
that capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight years later, when another Cabinet offer came,
Mineta jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, called Mineta last
Friday to gauge his availability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you interested?'' Podesta asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta said he responded without hesitation: ``Do you want me to
crawl through the telephone line to your office right now?''

FAA FAULTS ALASKA AIRLINES BUT LETS IT CONTINUE FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alaska Airlines has allowed mechanics to perform
work for which they are not qualified, skipped maintenance on test
equipment and failed to tell pilots when equipment was inoperable,
the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday. But the agency
said it had accepted the airline's remedial plan and would not shut
down its maintenance operation, as officials had threatened.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a top FAA official faulted his agency's
performance in overseeing Alaska Airlines in the period before the
crash of one of its MD-80 jets in January, and said FAA inspectors
would begin special audits of the nation's other nine large
passenger carriers in the next few days, to look for similar
management problems.
</P>
<P>
   The official, L. Nick Lacey, acting director of the Flight
Standards Service, said the problem at Alaska Airlines was not
simply the specific flaws found, but the pattern of errors and the
failure to correct them. ``Often there are lapses and oversights
and mistakes, that type of thing,'' Lacey said, shortly after
notifying the airline, which is based in Seattle, that it would be
allowed to continue operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're seeing here is going beyond that,'' Lacey said,
``is going to the heart of why are these things happening, why are
these noncompliances slipping through the system, why are these
continuing over a long period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines has promised to hire 130 more maintenance and
engineering workers, including many supervisors, and 28 more people
for its flight operations department. The airline has also filled
some long-vacant executive positions, including director of
maintenance, a post that was vacant for nearly two years. Lacey
criticized the failure to quickly fill that job, but said his
agency might be partly at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is, did we allow them not to fill it?'' he said,
adding that he was ``disturbed'' by the agency's performance. He
hinted, though, that the FAA would seek a large fine against the
airline for its failings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of the findings were minor. The airline had
installed enhanced medical kits in the rear overhead bins of its
Boeing 737's but had not posted signs to show where the kits were.
Other findings were more serious. The investigation found, for
example, that the airline lacks enough instructors to train pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lacey said Thursday, ``what I never found in that report
was unsafe airplanes in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash that set off the FAA's investigation took place on
Jan. 31, when an MD-80 jet trying to make an emergency landing in
Los Angeles plunged into the Pacific, killing all 88 people on
board. The investigation has focused on the horizontal stabilizer,
the movable portion of the horizontal tail that the pilots use to
make the nose point up or down, but the National Transportation
Safety Board, an independent agency, is still trying to determine
the cause of the crash. The FAA is assisting in that investigation,
but Lacey would not talk about it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The flaws found at the airline have not been tied directly to
the crash. The situation is reminiscent of the aftermath of the
crash of a Valujet DC-9 in the Florida Everglades in May 1996.
After that crash, the FAA conducted an inspection of the airline
and then shut it down, but for reasons that were unrelated to the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Such investigations often result, though, in criticism by the
NTSB of the FAA's program for monitoring airline safety.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection of the other airlines _ America West, American,
Continental, Delta, Northwest, Southwest, TWA, United and US
Airways _ is an unusual effort to identify management problems.
``This is not a traditional inspection when we're out there on the
ramp, running around and tire-kicking,'' Lacey said. It is also
intended to identify good practices that can be used at other
airlines, he said, including the use of statistical systems to find
troublesome parts that require more frequent maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said inspectors would repeatedly revisit Alaska Airlines
to see if it was carrying out its improvement plan. ``We'll come
back again and again and again and make appropriate decisions at
each point along the way,'' he said.

JUST YOUR AVERAGE MOTORCYCLE WITH YOUR CORVETTE V-8 ENGINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By JIM McCRAW    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monte Warne is a down-home Renaissance man, a Michelangelo of
machinery: A licensed aircraft and airplane-engine mechanic, an
aircraft designer, a licensed private, commercial and crop-duster
pilot, a lifelong motorcyclist and a former motorcycle and car
racer. So what possessed him to build the outrageous Boss Hoss, a
motorcycle with a Corvette V-8 engine?
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1998 when Warne picked up a new Harley-Davidson
Heritage Softail in Memphis. By the time he drove it 75 miles home
to Dyersburg, Tenn., he decided that it had too much vibration and
not enough power. He sold it with just 500 miles on the odometer.
</P>
<P>
   That winter, with time on his hands, $10,000 in his pocket and
an idea in his head, he decided to build his own motorcycle. He
took a modified Chevy engine out of his race car, put it on the
shop floor and tried to figure out how to build a motorcycle around
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He used steel tubing for the frame, a widened Harley-Davidson
Fat Bob fuel tank, a Harley-Davidson front end and a right-angle
gearbox from a lawn mower to get the power to the rear wheel via a
foot-operated clutch and chain drive. He used a 12-inch-wide
Hoosier dirt-track racing tire at the rear, a modified Harley rear
suspension and the rear disc brake from a 1982 Dodge Colt.
</P>
<P>
   That first bike overheated, so he had a special radiator built.
It rode hard, so he reduced the tire's air pressure from 40 pounds
per square inch down to just 12. The Harley front forks flexed so
badly under the V-8's weight that he had to reinforce them. And
that was the beginning of the mechanical evolution that led to the
Boss Hoss. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within days, bikers around Dyersburg started asking Warne to
build frame kits so they could create their own Chevy-powered
bikes. He built another V-8 bike during the crop-dusting off-season
in 1990, and took both his creations to Florida in 1991, to the
annual Daytona Bike Week.
</P>
<P>
   Warne says the presence of the loud, brawny V-8 bikes in Daytona
Beach caused a near-riot of spectators and photographers. But if
the Boss Hosses attracted the police, they also got the attention
of the motorcycle press. Warne sold the first two bikes, and
would-be customers started to call.
</P>
<P>
   In Dyersburg, he sold both his crop-dusting business and a local
racetrack that he and his wife, Meredith, operated. They started
Boss Hoss Motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   Warne and his employees (there are 22 now) have since built
2,000 Boss Hosses for well-heeled riders around the world.
Celebrity buyers include Jay Leno, the ``Tonight Show'' host; Mark
Martin, the Winston Cup racer (whose bike is painted like his red,
white and blue Valvoline Taurus race car); Sammy Swindell, the
World of Outlaws racer who modified his bike with his own engine;
Vince McMahon, the World Wrestling Federation impresario; and Stone
Cold Steve Austin, the wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Riders must straddle the big engines, but Warne says the seating
position is similar to a Harley's, with the feet about 22 inches
apart. Nor is the weight a problem except when parking; once the
bike is in gear, the engine's torque melts the pounds away.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss Hoss has evolved through several generations. The 2000
model uses a 350-cubic-inch, 355-horsepower engine shipped from
General Motors ready to install. (By contrast, the world's most
powerful conventional motorcycle, Kawasaki's new ZX-12R Ninja,
makes 183 horsepower.) The production Boss Hoss uses a specially
built, foot-shifted two-speed automatic transmission with a reverse
gear _ it comes in handy if you're trying to get an 1,100-pound
motorcyle out of a parking space _ and a Gates belt drive similar
to those in Harleys.
</P>
<P>
   The Boss Hoss uses three gigantic Wilwood racing disc brakes,
two at the front and one at the rear, and Avon motorcycle tires.
Even with the V-8's power, the bike gets 30 miles to the gallon,
Warne said, and can go 300 miles on a tank of fuel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Boss Hoss meets federal regulations and is sold in 49
states, with California to be added as soon as the bike passes the
state's emissions test.
</P>
<P>
   For the truly power-hungry for whom 355 horsepower isn't enough
(or, some bikers might suggest, for the truly insane), the Boss
Hoss can be ordered with a 502-cubic-inch, 500-horsepower GM
engine. If either V-8 sounds like a bit much, you can order a bike
with a 4.3-liter V-6, also from GM, with a mere 200 horsepower. If
you'd like a more stable platform, there are three-wheeled Boss
Hoss ``trikes'' with rear ends that resemble either a '57 Chevy or
a '64 Corvette. Trikes, too, can be had with V-6, 350 V-8, or 502
V-8 engines. Prices start at $25,500 for the basic two-wheeled V-6
and go up to $38,000 for the 502 trike.
</P>
<P>
   Every Boss Hoss is custom-painted to the customer's
specifications, so no two are alike. There are 40 Boss Hoss dealers
in the United States, plus a network in several other countries.

GORE PLEDGES $25 BILLION TO IMPROVE MASS TRANSPORTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore called Wednesday for more
federal spending on light rail transportation systems and on buses
that use cleaner fuels, saying he would devote $25 billion over 10
years to improve mass transportation in states and cities, reduce
air pollution and liberate Americans from too heavy a dependence on
oil.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wanted to liberate them from having to travel to
work every day in the same old, tired, potentially expensive and
possibly sluggish way. ``You deserve the independence to get in
your car and drive anywhere you want to go, on your own schedule,
without having to empty your wallet at every filling station,''
Gore said at a campaign event today in Chicago, against a backdrop
of the skyline and Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should also have the choice, if you want it, to park your
car at the light rail station and be moved swiftly into a newly
thriving downtown without having to worry about gridlock,'' he
said, later adding, ``You can choose which transportation fits your
own life on any hectic day.''
</P>
<P>
   The $25 billion that he pledged brought to about $148 billion
the amount of money Gore has said the federal government should
spend over 10 years to make everything from power plants to family
sedans more fuel-efficient and less toxic to the environment. Gore
outlined his plans over three days in three swing states _
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois _ that he was tentatively scheduled
to visit yet again next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore's aides said that the $25 billion would finance grants for
which states, cities and local agencies could compete, and it would
cover projects like the rehabilitation of neighborhoods near rail
stations.
</P>
<P>
   And he made clear in a subsequent news conference that, unlike
President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s, he was not trying to
browbeat Americans into parsimonious use of energy. He was, in an
era of enormous budget surpluses, trying to use federal spending
and mostly tax incentives to nudge Americans toward more
fuel-efficient, environmentally sensitive living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the idea that in order to have a clean environment
and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we all have to put on
hair shirts and turn off the air-conditioners and swelter inside
and feel good that we're doing our duty for the environment,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for domestic oil, Gore said that its producers had a lot of
explaining to do and that he had informed officials with the
Federal Trade Commission that he wanted its hearings into the
increase in gasoline prices to be open to the public. Gore proudly
noted that since he called for those hearings last week, prices had
begun to decline.

SENSE OF DRAMA BUILDS AS GORE KEEPS SILENT ON RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many of the names for the Democratic
vice-presidential nomination have been circulating for months _
Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, Gov. Jim
Hunt of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But such is the state of the hunt for a vice president for the
vice president that no name on the Democratic side has yet so
distinguished itself that it lifts up hearts and wipes others off
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, with less than six weeks before the Democratic
convention, new names, maybe preposterous names, are slipping into
the void. What about Robert Rubin, the former Treasury secretary?
Or, in the latest musing, what about Tom Brokaw, the NBC News
anchorman?
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Vice President Al Gore insist that no one knows
anything. But the Gore camp is coming to believe that it needs to
do something dramatic to catch imaginations, especially since Gov.
George W. Bush, who holds a strong lead in most polls, will
probably be riding pretty high when he comes out of the Republican
convention with his own running mate two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention has seemed to focus more on the Republican
side, in part because Bush is gabbier than Gore, his convention is
sooner and he seems to have more choices.
</P>
<P>
   But if Gore is to be taken at his word, he is under the same
time constraints as Bush. He told reporters in late April that his
choice would not be dictated by Bush's choice and that he expected
to make his selection by the time the Republicans gather in
Philadelphia, at the end of July, even though the Democratic
convention is two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventions are so close together,'' Gore said at the
time, that whether his choice is actually announced or not, ``it
will be effectively made before then.''
</P>
<P>
   The tight-lipped Gore has said little publicly since then,
except to note that his top criterion was whether the person could
take over immediately as president and that he would obviously want
to pick someone with whom he was personally comfortable. (``No, I'm
going to pick someone I can't stand!'' he joked recently when
asked, as he is endlessly, whether personal chemistry was
important.)
</P>
<P>
   From all signs, Gore is replicating the selection process that
was used by Bill Clinton in 1992. He has put the same
super-discreet person, Warren Christopher, in charge of the search.
And he is hoping for the same kind of spontaneous combustion that
took place when Gore himself was chosen by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who in 1992 had been dragging in the polls behind
President Bush and was even running third behind Ross Perot,
announced Gore as his vice-presidential running mate four days
before the convention. Clinton was suddenly catapulted to first
place and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's had not been among the names mentioned in advance, and it
is quite possible that Gore's ultimate choice will not be among
those mentioned now.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, unlike Gov. Bush, has not really flirted publicly with any
of his possible choices. Bush seems to be amused by the game, while
Gore does nothing to encourage speculation about anyone.
</P>
<P>
   One of the considerations for Gore at this point is whether to
go with a regional candidate to nail down a particular state or
whether to go with a bigger-picture candidate to generate more
national excitement and make a broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first category would be someone like Graham to make a
claim on Florida or Gov. Gray Davis to nail down California or Sen.
Richard Durbin to make a statement in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In the second would be someone like Rubin, who would send a
signal that a seasoned financial expert would be minding the store.
A big subject of debate in Democratic circles is what kind of
candidate Rubin, who has never run for office, might make and
whether his lack of expertise in other realms would matter. He has
appeared numerous times with Gore on the campaign trail, but rarely
to scintillating effect. Others say that his financial experience
is such a plus, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   And there is a third category _ someone who might help capture a
particular kind of voter, not one based on region. This would
include Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, who might help Gore improve
his standing with organized labor and neutralize the effect of
Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who threatens to undermine
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And what of Brokaw? One top Republican burst out laughing at the
mention of his name. The reason? ``The first rule of picking a
running mate is to do no harm,'' this Republican said. ``The second
is, don't overshadow your nominee. What he would be telling the
country is, `I can't do this on my own. I have to bring in an
absolute superstar from outside government to prop myself up.'''
</P>
<P>
   One person who is enjoying watching the process is Neil Oxman, a
Democratic consultant based in Philadelphia and Gore's media
adviser in 1988. He said that while he had no specific knowledge of
this year's process, a very complex polling process was almost
certainly going on beneath the surface, one that would consume
perhaps $400,000 over the next few weeks as people close to Gore
conducted focus groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, pollsters were likely showing voters in
Indiana relatively neutral interviews with Bayh and then asking if
his presence on the ticket would make them more likely or less
likely to vote for Gore. They would ask the same question in media
markets close to Indiana, he said, but then, the farther away from
Indiana they got, they would ask more generic questions _ what is
known in the trade as ``Candidate A'' questions.
</P>
<P>
   These are along the lines of, how would you feel about Candidate
A, who has been the governor of a Midwest state and who has not
raised taxes and is now a senator? If reactions to these questions
are positive, Oxman said, the campaign could believe that Bayh
could be a good choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about marketing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican who is close to the Bush campaign said it was
clear, in any case, that Gore needed to do something dramatic to
shake up the race. So who would he pick if he were Gore? He thought
for a moment and said the most dramatic name he could think of:
``Bill Clinton.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For ages, nations have dreamed of building invulnerable shields
to protect themselves from hostile forces. There was the Great Wall
and the Maginot line and, in America, the Safeguard anti-missile
system and Star Wars.
</P>
<P>
   All fell short. Now, the Clinton administration and its military
advisers may try again, this time with a limited anti-missile
weapon they think can go a long way toward immunizing America
against attack _ at least from missiles launched by adversaries
like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, which are known to be developing
intercontinental missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon and experts outside the government say
this defense technology has reached a new level of maturity. They
argue that the combination of miniaturized parts and fast rockets
can produce an agile, light-weight weapon that can find and ram an
incoming warhead at about 7,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are skeptical that it can work. Even its advocates
compare the overall challenge of building and orchestrating the
system's millions of delicate parts to developing the atom bomb and
putting men on the moon. One question is whether the defending
weapon can survive the boost into orbit. More fundamental is
whether it can be made to distinguish between a warhead heading for
the United States and a cloud of decoys, a task that it has about
100 seconds to accomplish. In fact, since research on so-called
hit-to-kill weapons began in 1976, attempts to destroy mock
warheads in space have failed more than 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial flight test of the technology is set for next Friday,
when a ground-based interceptor missile is to thunder aloft and try
to destroy a mock warhead in space. If it goes well, President
Clinton may decide this fall whether to build the first phase of
the so-called national missile defense. Though the administration
is weighing approval of preliminary construction, it says a final
deployment decision may fall to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the proposed system would be a supersmart
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' designed to be carried atop a
rocket and guide itself to a collision with an incoming warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents are confident that it can work, even though the first
two tests of this design were discouraging. One was a partially
lucky hit and the other a complete miss. If next week's test fails
as well, the chorus of critics will no doubt grow.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the proposed project is both challenging and
enormous, growing in four steps from an initial 20 missile
interceptors in 2005 to a much larger system by 2011. By the time
it is complete, the shield would require at least 2 launching
sites, 3 command centers, 5 communication relay stations, 15
radars, 29 satellites, 250 underground silos and 250 missile
interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   It would be based in Hawaii, Alaska, California, Colorado, North
Dakota, Massachusetts, Greenland, Britain and possibly Maine. Two
radars would be set up in Asia at sites so far undisclosed,
possibly in Japan and South Korea. Building it would cost at least
$60 billion and running it would take at least 1,455 people, and
probably hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase alone is supposed to take eight years, the
government says, though most experts consider 12 to 16 years a
safer pace and less risky.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-missile program's director, Lt. Gen. Ronald T.
Kadish of the Air Force, says a rushed job is doable, just barely.
``We're confident in the path we've chosen,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``Our program will do what we ask it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the interceptors can pick out enemy decoys that
are sure to accompany any attack, Kadish said he was certain that
new anti-missile technology would enable the system to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not well understood,'' he said. ``Critics assume the
system will remain static forever. We've never assumed it would
never change.'' He added, ``We can play the countermeasure,
counter-countermeasure game.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say this approach will only beget costly arms races
that will erode confidence in any anti-missile weapon.
</P>
<P>
   If the anti-missile issues can be resolved, and a weapon built
that really works, the nation might at last establish something
approaching a limited nuclear sanctuary. If the effort proves
futile, it risks wasting billions while upsetting a balance of
terror that has kept an uneasy peace among nuclear antagonists for
more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAN:
</P>
<P>
   In Space, Feats of Annihilation
</P>
<P>
   The exoatmospheric kill vehicle, a 130-pound wonder just 54
inches long, is the star of the Clinton plan. It is made by
Raytheon at a plant in Tucson. In space, it would guide itself
toward the target, its tiny computer analyzing sensor readings and
firing thrusters.
</P>
<P>
   Its big challenge is to disregard the decoys amid the nuclear
warheads, which the sensor tracks through their heat rays and sees
as twinkling points of light, like stars.
</P>
<P>
   Zipping along at about 2 miles per second, the kill vehicle is
to slam into the nuclear warhead in space and demolish it by force
of impact.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-missile designers praise the kill vehicle as the apex of
miniaturization and accuracy. By contrast, they say, the world's
first successful hit-to-kill interceptor, in 1984, had to unfurl a
15-foot-wide steel umbrella to raise the odds of collision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world of difference, the way the technology has
moved,'' said Edward L. Wilkinson, project manager of the 1984
system, which succeeded after three failures.
</P>
<P>
   Donald R. Baucom, an anti-missile historian at the Pentagon,
said the new kill vehicle's deadly agility would be rooted in its
miniaturized parts and light weight _ pounds vs. earlier tons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even its staunchest backers acknowledge that the kill
vehicle is blind to enemy warheads for most of its flight.
Raytheon, its maker, says it can pick up the telltale heat
emanations of targets only in the last 100 or so seconds before
impact.
</P>
<P>
   So the weapon must still rely on radars and satellites to find
its quarry. The needed helpers, detailed in April in a
Congressional Budget Office report, and in interviews with its
author, Geoffrey Forden, include these:
</P>
<P>
   -- Early-warning radars. Five existing ones would be improved
and a new one built in Asia to help alert the force of interceptor
missiles of enemy attack.
</P>
<P>
   -- High-resolution radars. These can better resolve targets in
space to aid tracking, eliminate decoys and assess whether targeted
warheads have been destroyed. Nine would be built.
</P>
<P>
   -- Missile-tracking satellites. These detect heat from newly
launched missiles and can help estimate flight paths. In time,
existing ones would be supplemented by five new ones, all in high
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   -- Warhead-tracking satellites. From low orbits, 24 of these new
spacecraft would aid the hunt for warheads and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   -- Command centers. The main one at Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., a
bunker hewn out of solid rock, would link all the data and its
officers would fight the defensive war.
</P>
<P>
   -- In-flight relays. On the ground, radio transmitters would
send navigational signals to missile interceptors heading for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of this network is not only to aid kill vehicles but to
push the defensive battle as close as possible to enemy territory
so as to give military officers time to fire more than one
interceptor at a specific warhead, raising the odds of success.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is known as shoot-look-shoot. In theory, anti-missile
officials say, three or more hits might be attempted against a
given warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, director of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, told Congress in February that if interceptors were
80 percent dependable, two tries would provide 96 percent
confidence and three would give 99 percent assurance of a
successful kill.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated power of the weapon system is a state secret.
But documents that the State Department gave Moscow in January said
the full system would be able to destroy up to 50 enemy warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The system's full coverage is detailed in a Pentagon map. Its
colors range from red to blue for ``bad'' to ``good'' levels of
protection and show North America as solid blue _ including all 50
states, Canada and Mexico. Cuba, however, is a conspicuous green,
its coverage relatively poor.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this protection, the Pentagon would base 20
interceptors in central Alaska by 2005 and 100 by 2007, ready to
shoot down missiles coming out of such places as North Korea. By
2011, the Pentagon would put a total of 125 interceptors in Alaska,
and 125 in North Dakota, either at the old Safeguard anti-missile
base in Nekoma, N.D., which was mothballed 25 years ago, or farther
south at Grand Forks.
</P>
<P>
   Either site would increase the system's ability to target
warheads streaking in from the Middle East, where military experts
cite Iraq and Iran as possible threats.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, experts talk of a third interceptor base in Maine to
raise the East Coast's level of protection. ``Ideally,'' said Bill
Davis, an anti-missile pioneer who advises the National Missile
Defense Program, ``you'd like to have three sites.''
</P>
<P>
   THE PROBLEMS:
</P>
<P>
   Doubts on Science And Engineering
</P>
<P>
   A quiet threat to anti-missile success is the defense industry
itself, which loves the huge contracts but is reeling after years
of mergers and cutbacks. The defense system's main contractors _
Boeing, Raytheon and TRW and Lockheed Martin _ insist that they are
up to the anti-missile job. But many experts have doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these companies are in trouble at the same time,'' said
Richard Cook, a former Lockheed vice president who backs the
anti-missile plan. ``They're poorly managed. And they're not
attracting the talent.''
</P>
<P>
   In a major setback, the Air Force last year canceled a $832
million contract with TRW and Boeing for test models of the
low-orbit satellites because of cost overruns and troubles with
software and sensors. Now, the first six of 24 satellites are to be
experimental. When fired into space in 2006 or 2007, rigorous
testing is to reveal any flaws in time to fix later models.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a backup effort at expanded ground testing is ``making
good progress,'' said Sally Koris, a TRW spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   But computers meant to manage the battle are performing poorly.
In recent ground tests, they failed five of six objectives, the
Congressional Budget Office report said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest woes center on the kill vehicle itself. Its
development is proving unusually hard, even after Pentagon
officials cut the number of decoys in flight tests from nine to
one.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed its first interception test as
an unqualified success but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle
had initially drifted off course and picked out the large decoy
balloon instead of the warhead. In a January test, a leak of sensor
coolant made the missile interceptor miss the target altogether.
</P>
<P>
   After investigating Raytheon, a 12-person Pentagon panel headed
by retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch last year found that a
shortage of spare parts was behind testing delays, higher risks and
work omissions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, the panel said there was danger that the kill
vehicle would fall apart when shaken atop its booster rocket, the
development of which is lagging far behind schedule at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary two-stage booster used in flight tests is slow and
relatively gentle. The three-stage one planned for war is fast and
rough. The Welch panel said it was unclear whether the kill vehicle
``is designed to withstand'' the planned tumult of shocks and
vibrations, calling such uncertainty ``a high risk'' and urging
close attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Barring new delays, the first time the kill vehicle is to
thunder into space atop the Boeing booster is next year, and Boeing
says it is moving steadily toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Danchick, a senior engineer at TRW who retired two years ago
after four decades in the industry, said many of the anti-missile
ills derived from corporate disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contractors no longer have the talent pool,'' he
continued. ``So they fake it with glossy view graphs.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the contractors insist that they are in good
shape and are simply experiencing the growing pains natural to any
big project. ``We're making significant strides at Lockheed and the
missile defense industry in general,'' said Jeffery Adams, a
Lockheed Martin spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, feeling the most pressure of all, is deferring
technical questions to the Pentagon, said David Shea, a company
spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques S. Gansler, the Pentagon's acquisition director,
recently conceded that the Defense Department and its contractors
were pushing the technological limits. ``It's clearly a high-risk
overall program,'' he told reporters this month, adding that having
everything work right on the coming flight test was ``not a high
probability.''
</P>
<P>
   The test flight next Friday is to be the most demanding yet and
the first to aid the hunt in space for the mock warhead by relaying
data from a ground radar to the kill vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After that experiment, 16 more intercept attempts, each costing
about $100 million, are to fly before the planned initial
deployment in 2005. The Pentagon says data from these increasingly
complex tests will help designers debug the anti-missile system and
improve the weapon's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it eventually works perfectly, critics say, the kill
vehicle and its radar and satellite assistants can still be undone
easily by decoys and other countermeasures that even an
inexperienced attacker like Iraq or North Korea is sure to employ.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the security
studies program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
released a 175-page study on likely enemy countermeasures, saying
such tricks were much easier than making a missile.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it said that disguising a weapon to look like a
decoy _ just wrapping a Mylar balloon around a warhead so it drifts
inconspicuously among other decoy balloons _ would foil the
defense. The Pentagon has announced no plans to test the kill
vehicle against such a stratagem.
</P>
<P>
   Federal intelligence agencies also worry about such
countermeasures. Last September, a National Intelligence Estimate
said that nations developing missiles could also respond to a
defensive shield with at least eight types of tricks and decoys,
including simple balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the system say critics naively credit foes with great
powers. The technology of deception is far from easy, they say, and
defensive arms can evolve to foil any offensive trick.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the anti-missile pioneer who consults for the current
program, said new generations of kill-vehicle sensors would have
chips of up to 1.05 million pixels, far beyond the current level of
65,536 pixels and the 72 pixels of the 1984 success. So in the
future, he said, sensor resolution will soar, aiding the kill
vehicle's ability to ferret out subtle differences among warheads
and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game that never ends,'' he said, faulting the critics.
``You get action and reaction all the time. So it's a little unfair
for them to state with finality that they know of a simple, cheap
countermeasure that can defeat the system from here to eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, dismissed such statements as glib, saying
the reality was so grim that contractors and Defense Department
officials were resorting to widespread anti-missile fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In two reports to the White House, Postol has charged that the
Pentagon is covering up its own discovery that the sensor cannot
tell warheads from decoys and, to hide this flaw, is rigging all
interception tests of the kill vehicle. These flight tests began
last year and are to run to 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has strongly denied his charges, saying
that the kill vehicle, teamed with its proposed array of radars and
orbiting sensors, can do the discrimination job just fine. And
Kadish and other Pentagon officials have hinted repeatedly that the
job will be aided by technologies and techniques that are secret.
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Munn, a retired Lockheed chief scientist whose team
accomplished the first hit-to-kill successes in outer space, in
1984 and 1991, said the Pentagon was deluding itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discrimination looks easy when you do it on paper,'' he said.
``But you get up there and you never see what you expect _ the data
never agree with the predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to make it work is to dumb it down,'' Dr. Munn
said of anti-missile flight testing. ``There's no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   THE ALTERNATIVES:
</P>
<P>
   From Boost Phase to No Phase
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States has focused its energies on ways to
kill incoming warheads once they are well under way, there is, at
least in theory, a clever way to sidestep the whole problem of
designing interceptors that must seek out the correct target: It
would be to smash a missile while its engines are firing _ before
it releases its payload of warheads, chaff, balloons and other
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   Hot engine flames are considered an easy target compared with
warheads that are merely warm. And thin-skinned missiles, laden
with highly explosive fuel and laboring to escape the Earth's
gravity, are fragile compared with hardened warheads meant to
survive fiery atmospheric re-entry. Finally, the missiles move at a
relatively slow pace.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow surprised Washington in early June by suggesting that
so-called boost-phase anti-missile systems were better than the
Clinton proposal. For years, the Russians have discussed the idea
with American scientists, including Postol of MIT and Richard L.
Garwin, chairman of the State Department's advisory board on arms
control.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is simple: To thwart a North Korean attack a nearby
interceptor based at sea or on land (Russia abuts North Korea)
would smash the rising missile, shattering its body and sending its
warheads plummeting back to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen, after going to Moscow to
hear the Kremlin's proposal, backed developing a boost-phase weapon
jointly. ``We're prepared to cooperate with them,'' he told
reporters. But Cohen added that any resulting weapon would be slow
in coming and no substitute for a national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, boost-phase technology has never been tested
and if perfected would have to be based at multiple sites within a
few hundred miles of missile threats. That would be relatively easy
for North Korea, possible for Iraq (with interceptors in Turkey or
Kuwait) and difficult for Iran (with interceptors in Belarus,
Ukraine or Kazakhstan).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big project,'' Postol said of boost-phase defenses.
``Nothing even close to it could come off the shelf'' of existing
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican
presidential nominee, raised the stakes even further. In May, he
said that as president he would back research on more robust
anti-missile weapons like lasers and weapons in space, taking a
page from President Reagan's Star Wars plan.
</P>
<P>
   Space arms could cost up to many hundreds of billions of
dollars. Their allure that is they could, in theory, hit rising
missiles in their boost phase with great ease and offer protection
against large strikes. But here, too, there are countermeasures and
global coverage could be hard. One Star Wars proposal envisioned a
need for 100,000 orbital arms.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the risks of anti-missile weapons outweigh any
benefits. Besides spurring arms races, they worry that such weapons
could promote military tactics that raise the risk of accidental
war and can be viewed as provocative because ``defensive'' arms can
also do things as attack satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents counter that anti-missile arms could deter missile
development by small nations, preserve freedom of action for the
United States during international crises and _ most important _
save lives. And new kinds of global teamwork, they add, could
forestall arms races.
</P>
<P>
   A shadow that hangs over all these anti-missile proposals is
Safeguard, the only weapon the United States ever built against
long-range missiles. Switched on in North Dakota in October 1975,
it was meant to shield nearby missile fields from a disarming first
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Its plug was pulled as military strategists concluded that
Moscow could overwhelm it with a rush of new warheads then being
deployed. In all, the $25 billion weapon system lasted just 133
days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its mothballed base is a wilderness of broken asphalt,
empty silos, tumbled buildings and a chapel, eerily intact. It
stands as a monument to what can go awry in anti-missile plans.

 &HT;    Government testimony begins in Branch Davidian trial
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Jurors in the Branch Davidian wrongful death
lawsuit shifted their focus Thursday from inside the sect's
compound to the outside as the government began presenting its side
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopter crew members who escaped Davidian gunfire and a
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who was wounded
during the Feb. 28, 1993, raid at Mount Carmel opened government
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After plaintiffs' attorneys concluded their cases Thursday
morning, U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. rejected a motion
by government lawyers to dismiss the lawsuit by Branch Davidian
survivors and family members.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Thursday afternoon, ATF agents Eric Evers and Kris
Mayfield testified that they never expected to be met by such
strong resistance as they arrived at David Koresh's compound to
arrest the sect leader on weapons violations charges and search the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Evers, who was wounded, told jurors that he was riding in the
cab of the first of two pickups that pulled cattle trailers filled
with ATF agents up to the front door of the complex. Mayfield was
riding in the back of the second trailer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Evers' assignment that morning was to run around to the side of
the compound and handcuff anyone who was working near an
underground pit area, he said. Mayfield was part of the dynamic
entry team assigned to rush the front door and announce the agents'
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield told jurors that he saw an unarmed Koresh for an
instant standing in the doorway as he and other agents approached.
He said he didn't hear Koresh say anything before the door closed
and automatic gunfire shot through the closed door and front wall.
Seconds before that, Mayfield said he had heard gunfire on the
north side of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who said he didn't have his pistol drawn when he ran
up to the front door, leaped behind a piece of equipment near the
front door for cover and said he drew his weapon and returned fire
through the front door and a nearby window.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorney Marie Hagen asked why he didn't have his
weapon drawn sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect to have anybody ambush us or shoot at us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys carried half of the mangled double front
door over to within a few feet of the five-member jury to provide a
closer view of the bullet holes. Mayfield said that the bullet
holes in the door indicate bullets that traveled in both
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said they misplaced the right side of
the double front door, and Davidian defense attorneys during the
criminal trial in San Antonio got a lot of mileage out of
speculating why the other half of the door is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield said the only time he fired was when he saw bullets
being directed toward him or other agents. He said he could not see
who was firing, but returned fire in the general direction from
which the bullets came.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taking a lot of machine-gun fire from the window just
above where I was and I fired several rounds into that window so
whoever was in there would back off and quit firing,'' Mayfield
said. ``It seemed that only caused the gunfire to intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he attempted to throw a flash-bang device through the
window, but it struck the wall and bounced off.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen asked Mayfield who he saw after the ceasefire was declared
and the ATF walked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Steve Willis, a friend of mine,'' Mayfield said. ``I
wasn't able to talk to him. He was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lead plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell asked Mayfield during
cross-examination to walk over to the controversial front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little worse for wear,'' Caddell said. ``It didn't look like
that on Feb. 28, did it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked Mayfield to count the number of incoming bullet
holes in the left side of door. Mayfield counted four incoming
bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping the door, Caddell asked Mayfield, ``Do those look like
tank treads to you? Something ran over it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell then asked if a Davidian might have fired through the
door as a tank barrelled over it. Hagen, however, objected before
Mayfield could answer. Smith agreed that the question called for
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen later had Mayfield count the number of outgoing bullet
holes in the door. There were 10.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell showed the court a photograph taken during the siege
that showed the missing right side of the door. It was peppered
with bullet holes. That's the side of the door that Koresh held
open when he greeted the ATF.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving Davidians claim it was proof that ATF agents were the
aggressors on the day of the raid. Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin,
Koresh's attorney during the siege, testified earlier that all the
bullet holes in the right side of the door were from incoming
shots.
</P>
<P>
   After court recessed, Caddell said the government's introduction
of the door backfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing the left-half of the door into the courtroom was not
a good move,'' Caddell said. ``It's got tank treads on it. It's got
bullet holes that its own witness admits are bigger than the
Davidian bullet holes.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Caddell said, it raises questions as to what happened to
the other side of the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, I think the right-hand door was lost on purpose,''
Caddell said. ``I don't think there's any other reasonable
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers said he was felled by a shotgun blast that struck him in
the chest as he rounded the corner of the building and headed
toward the pit. He said he took two rounds that struck his
bullet-proof vest, one that struck his shoulder and one to the
right wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, You need to get up. You need to get up. These guys
are shooting real bullets. This isn't a game. They are going to
drop a bullet on my head,'' Evers said.
</P>
<P>
   Four ATF agents were killed and more than 20 were wounded during
the raid. Five Branch Davidians were killed that morning and
another was killed in a separate incident later that afternoon.
Others were wounded, including Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Evers said he climbed into a ditch and stayed there until the
ceasefire about 2 1/2 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, three members of the Texas National Guard
testified that they were riding in three helicopters meant to serve
as diversions during the raid. All said their aircrafts drew
gunfire from the Davidians, forcing them to land nearby.
</P>
<P>
   While ATF agents on board one of the helicopters carried
pistols, no shots were fired from the helicopters, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Government testimony will resume this morning.

FORGET SOSA: YANKS TRADE FOR JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Refusing to make a high-priced trade for Sammy Sosa,
the New York Yankees instead acquired outfielder David Justice from
Cleveland Thursday night, the first move to bolster their sagging
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees swapped outfielder Ricky Ledee and two minor league
players to be named in return for the 34-year-old Justice, who has
21 homers and 58 runs batted in this season _ more homers than any
Yankee. Justice apparently was Plan C for the Yankees, who failed
to complete a conditional trade for Detroit's Juan Gonzalez last
week and then haggled without success for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees informed the Cubs of their impending trade for
Justice, Chicago's general manager, Ed Lynch, passed on the word to
Sosa, who was playing in Pittsburgh Thursday night. ``Sammy was
disappointed,'' said Andy MacPhail, the president of the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Indians have agreed on a list of minor leaguers
from which the two unnamed players will be selected by Aug. 1. By
rule, the teams cannot announce the players on the list, which
figures to include at least one good prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Justice will likely divide his time as the designated hitter,
left fielder and right fielder. Shane Spencer has been used as the
designated hitter, but will probably get more time in the outfield
now. It's possible that manager Joe Torre will shake up the lineup
in a big way. Tino Martinez, who has been the Yankees' No. 5 hitter
behind Bernie Williams, is having a bad year, batting .266 with
seven homers and 40 RBI. Justice could move into the No. 5 spot,
with catcher Jorge Posada hitting sixth and Martinez dropping to
seventh, ahead of Spencer and Scott Brosius in the last two spots.
</P>
<P>
   Justice will be a long-term investment for the Yankees: He is
making $7 million this year and each of the next two years, and has
an option for the 2003 season for $7 million. That's about $10
million to $13 million less than they might have had to pay Sosa in
a contract extension. It was the potential cost in salary and
prospects that made Yankees' executives extremely leery of dealing
for Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees offered Ledee, outfielder Jackson Melian, pitcher
Jake Westbrook and a choice of Alfonso Soriano or D'Angelo Jimenez
for Sosa; the Cubs insisted on five players, including Melian,
Westbrook, Ledee and two players from a group of three that
included Soriano, Jimenez and Alex Graman, a Single-A pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also knew that when and if they agreed to a trade
for Sosa, they would then have to negotiate a contract extension _
an agreement that would revamp their salary structure and change
the dynamics of their forthcoming negotiations with Derek Jeter,
their 26-year-old shortstop, and Mariano Rivera, their closer.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, was enticed by
the idea of getting Sosa's power and marquee presence; his
executives were frightened by how such a trade would affect the
organization into the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs and Yankees reached a stalemate on Tuesday, and over
the last two days the Yankees reconsidered their stance. They spoke
again with the Baltimore Orioles about B.J. Surhoff, and exchanged
proposals for Oakland's John Jaha and San Diego's Ed Sprague. They
might still try to acquire Jaha or Sprague. And they talked about
Justice with the Indians, who, like the Yankees, are a struggling
American League power.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Justice had infuriated club officials by suggesting
that the Indians' best years might be behind them. ``There comes a
time when you say, `Hey, maybe the window of opportunity is closing
for them,''' Justice said.
</P>
<P>
   There were only three instances of brief contact between the
Yankees and Cubs on Wednesday and Thursday, and in all three
instances, it was MacPhail who made the call, reaching out to the
Yankees. But the response from Yankees' officials was that they
couldn't reach Steinbrenner and didn't know what they were going to
do.
</P>
<P>
   This evening, General Manager Brian Cashman began calling around
to all the teams with which he had been negotiating and informed
them he was about to make a significant trade. About a half-hour
before Thursday night's game, Torre summoned Ledee into his office
and told the outfielder _ who signed with the Yankees 10 years ago
_ that he was being traded.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee said goodbye to Jeter, Posada and a few others, but
couldn't face the rest of them, fearing he would be unable to
contain his emotions. His eyes were puffy and welled with tears
when he spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said. ``It's very, very sad. I'm just sad I
couldn't put it together with the Yankees, the team I wanted to be
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice was part of another shocking trade, in 1997, when
Atlanta swapped him to Cleveland in a deal that included Kenny
Lofton and Marquis Grissom. But Justice was still incredulous when
he was told Thursday evening that he was going to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' he said, ``but business is business. That's the
game we play.

GORE PLEDGES $25 BILLION TO IMPROVE MASS TRANSPORTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Corrects day in lede)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore called Thursday for more
federal spending on light rail transportation systems and on buses
that use cleaner fuels, saying he would devote $25 billion over 10
years to improve mass transportation in states and cities, reduce
air pollution and liberate Americans from too heavy a dependence on
oil.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wanted to liberate them from having to travel to
work every day in the same old, tired, potentially expensive and
possibly sluggish way. ``You deserve the independence to get in
your car and drive anywhere you want to go, on your own schedule,
without having to empty your wallet at every filling station,''
Gore said at a campaign event today in Chicago, against a backdrop
of the skyline and Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should also have the choice, if you want it, to park your
car at the light rail station and be moved swiftly into a newly
thriving downtown without having to worry about gridlock,'' he
said, later adding, ``You can choose which transportation fits your
own life on any hectic day.''
</P>
<P>
   The $25 billion that he pledged brought to about $148 billion
the amount of money Gore has said the federal government should
spend over 10 years to make everything from power plants to family
sedans more fuel-efficient and less toxic to the environment. Gore
outlined his plans over three days in three swing states _
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois _ that he was tentatively scheduled
to visit yet again next week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gore's aides said that the $25 billion would finance grants for
which states, cities and local agencies could compete, and it would
cover projects like the rehabilitation of neighborhoods near rail
stations.
</P>
<P>
   And he made clear in a subsequent news conference that, unlike
President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s, he was not trying to
browbeat Americans into parsimonious use of energy. He was, in an
era of enormous budget surpluses, trying to use federal spending
and mostly tax incentives to nudge Americans toward more
fuel-efficient, environmentally sensitive living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject the idea that in order to have a clean environment
and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we all have to put on
hair shirts and turn off the air-conditioners and swelter inside
and feel good that we're doing our duty for the environment,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for domestic oil, Gore said that its producers had a lot of
explaining to do and that he had informed officials with the
Federal Trade Commission that he wanted its hearings into the
increase in gasoline prices to be open to the public. Gore proudly
noted that since he called for those hearings last week, prices had
begun to decline.

DOCTORS EXPRESS RELIEF OVER HIGH COURT'S ABORTION DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ABORTION-RIGHTS) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors who do abortions as part of their regular medical
practice said Thursday that they were greatly relieved by the
decision of the Supreme Court that the government could not
prohibit doctors from performing a procedure that opponents call
partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   They said that laws trying to ban the procedure were so vague
that doctors performing almost any abortion could be prosecuted
under them.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said that medically, there is no such procedure as a
partial-birth abortion, calling the term a political label. The
Nebraska law struck down by the court described a partial-birth
abortion as one in which part of the fetus was outside the woman's
body before the fetus was killed. The doctors said many types of
abortion could fit that description.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William F. Harrison of the Washington Medical Center in
Fayetteville, Ark., said that when the Arkansas Legislature banned
the procedure, he was not concerned because he did abortions only
up to 18 weeks of pregnancy after the woman's last period, or in
rare cases a few weeks after that. But on reading the law, Harrison
said, it became clear that the statute was so broadly written that
it could apply to many abortions he performed.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said he talked to the local prosecutor, a friend,
about the problem. ``He said he'd never prosecute me under those
circumstances,'' Harrison said. ``I said, `Fine, I trust you, but
what about a few years from now when you are replaced by a
right-wing Republican prosecutor? Then what?' He couldn't answer
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Feldt, head of the national Planned Parenthood, said that
``we are pleased with the court's affirmation'' of the right to
abortion, ``but we in no way believe this is the end.'' Feldt
added, ``We know there will be another generation of bills, in
which they will try over and over again to establish that
legislatures can outlaw specific medical procedures at any time
during pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frederick Hopkins, an obstetrician in San Diego who also
serves as an officer of Planned Parenthood there, said one of the
troubling aspects of the campaign against so-called partial-birth
abortion was that while it was a threat to any doctor who performed
abortions, it had no medical aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as partial-birth abortion,'' Hopkins
said. ``It is not in any medical text and there is no medical
definition.'' Yet it is ``intimidating and frightening,'' he said,
``to think a doctor could have been prosecuted under such vague
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``doctors and patients are safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right To
Life Committee, said he was disappointed with the court decision,
but that efforts would continue to get a law passed to ban
``partial-birth abortions,'' one that would meet the approval of
the Supreme Court.

missiles launched by adversaries like like North Korea, Iran and
Iraq, which are known to be in various stages of developing
intercontinental missiles. But critics are skeptical that it can
work. Empty silos which contained Spring interceptors, designed to

WENDT, WHO BUILT GE CAPITAL SERVICES, IS NAMED HEAD OF CONSECO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Minn.)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Gary Wendt, the man who built GE Capital Services into
a financial services powerhouse, was named Thursday as chairman and
chief executive of Conseco Inc., the beleaguered insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt's appointment, which had been rumored for more than a
week, was hailed by Wall Street analysts, who said that Wendt's
experience and track record made him Conseco's best hope for a
strong recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Conseco, which rose sharply on Monday, jumped 14
percent Thursday, or $1.25, to $9, in heavy trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Wendt comes two months after Stephen C.
Hilbert, who founded Conseco 21 years ago, resigned as chairman and
chief executive, along with Rollin M. Dick, who quit as the
company's longtime chief financial officer. Both said investors had
lost confidence in their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco, which is based in Carmel, Ind., was once a high-flying
insurance and financial services company that had grown profitable
under Hilbert through a series of acquisitions. But Conseco has
been struggling the last two years, partly because of its costly
and seemingly ill-fated acquisition of Green Tree Financial, which
finances purchases of mobile homes. The company is now trying to
sell the unit, which has been renamed Conseco Finance.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt succeeds David W. Harkins, a company director who served
as acting chief executive after the departure of Hilbert.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old Wendt is now charged with trying to find a way
to sell Conseco Finance and restore confidence in a company whose
stock has lost about 82 percent of its value in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt said in a conference call with the media Thursday that it
was too early to outline a strategy or say exactly what course he
would take as chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he had accepted the job because he was familiar
with the financial services industry from his tenure at GE Capital
and that he relished the opportunity to turn around the company's
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears there's a challenge here,'' he said. ``There are
things that have to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said they were pleased with Wendt's
selection. But they cautioned that Conseco faces grave
difficulties. The company is trying to sell Conseco Finance at far
less than it paid in 1998. It is also facing a liquidity crunch
because of heavy borrowing of up $1 billion in bank debt. Profits
are declining.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said they expected the company to undertake a
restructuring effort in the next year. They say that days after the
First Union Corp. said it would close its Money Store operation, it
is not clear whether Conseco can find a viable buyer for its
finance unit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They certainly have gone out and hired the best guy to try and
turn around the business,'' said Colin Devine, an analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``But investors need to temper that because
considerable issues with the finances remain unchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said earlier this year that the sale of its finance
unit would take place by the third quarter, but Wendt said Thursday
that he would explore all options.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Seifert, an analyst at Standard &AMP; Poor's, said Wendt would
have to restore the confidence of big investors who lost confidence
in the last year of Hilbert's tenure, particularly after the
company reported disappointing first-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conseco lost a tremendous amount of institutional support,''
she said. ``It's going to take a long time to build that back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert also said the company would have to draw up a game plan
to restructure its operations and create a financial structure to
allow investors to evaluate the company's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to model this company is next to impossible,'' she
said, adding: ``For quite some time this has been a rudderless
ship. And Gary Wendt needs to get a game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   At GE Capital, which consists of about 29 businesses ranging
from credit cards to truck leasing, Wendt was known as a skillful
and visionary leader; over a dozen years, the unit's profits grew
to $4 billion from $300 million. By the late 1990s, GE Capital was
the most profitable division of General Electric, accounting for
about 40 percent of the company's profits in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He left in late 1998 in a management shakeup that some analysts
attribute in part strained relations with John F. Welch, the chief
executive of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Wendt and other former GE Capital executives created
a buyout and private equity investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after Hilbert resigned from Conseco, however, Wendt
tried to get in touch with Conseco officials at about the same time
the company was trying to reach him to inquire about his interest
in running the insurance giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our letters crossed in the mail,'' Wendt said. ``They were
calling me at the same time we were calling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that the negotiations
had been delayed because of a non-compete agreement Wendt had
signed with General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffer, a spokesman at General Electric, said Thursday
that Wendt had been in talks with the company to get approval to
take the Conseco post.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a negotiation to let Wendt out of his non-compete
agreement,'' Sheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer said General Electric would not elaborate on the
negotiations or comment on reports that as part of the agreement
General Electric would have options to take a stake in Conseco.

NEW U.S. FARM SUBSIDY PLAN IS CONTRARY TO EUROPEAN POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The Clinton administration introduced a sweeping
proposal Thursday at the World Trade Organization to change the way
governments subsidize farmers, challenging the European Union's
extensive agricultural subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The American plan would simplify financial support to farmers
and reduce or end disparities in tariffs to increase market
openings for agricultural goods from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, disclosed Thursday in Geneva and Washington, will
be formally introduced Friday at a session of the WTO agricultural
talks, which began in March.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the current domestic subsidies system would be
revised to eliminate those agricultural subsidies not directly
linked to price and volume of output. There would also be a ceiling
on the level of domestic subsidies based on a percentage of the
country's total agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. approach was welcomed by exporting countries, it
is likely to add to tension between the United States and the
European Union, which are already at odds over a number of
politically sensitive trade matters, including bananas and
corporate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to begin a new global trade round in Seattle in
December was in large part attributed to serious differences in how
to tackle the issue of agriculture. The United States and an
18-country group of agriculture exporters argue that European
export subsidies hinder competition and drive up consumer prices.
The EU, Switzerland, Norway and Japan maintain that rural areas
need such financial protection to ensure their survival.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these differences, members of the WTO are bound to
negotiate farm subsidies because of commitments they have already
made.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. proposal is directly contrary to the position of
the European Union, which spends about half of its total budget on
agricultural subsidies and supports payments to farmers not to grow
crops.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-country trading bloc has criticized the U.S. government
for denouncing subsidies at the same time it supports what the
Europeans call a hidden subsidy, emergency aid, to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Franz Fischler, the union's agricultural
commissioner, criticized American farm spending, saying the Clinton
administration had increased spending to record levels. Two weeks
ago, Congress passed a $15 billion relief bill to assist farmers
who are facing a fourth year of economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In Geneva, the American special negotiator for agriculture,
Gregory Frazier, defended emergency aid packages to American
farmers as falling within WTO rules.

   (NYT19) NEKOMA, N.D. -- June 29, 2000 -- MISSILE-DEFENSE -- For
ages, nations have dreamed of building invulnerable shields to
protect themselves from hostile forces. All fell short. Now, the
Clinton administration and its military advisers are trying again,
this time with a limited antimissile weapon they think will go a
long way toward immunizing America against attack at least from
missiles launched by adversaries like like North Korea, Iran and
Iraq, which are known to be in various stages of developing
intercontinental missiles. But critics are skeptical that it can
work. Empty silos which contained Spring interceptors, designed to

to indulge in hot dogs and fireworks, the Fourth of July weekend
can still call to mind the struggle around the event the holiday
commemorates, the signing of the Declaration of Independence. So
perhaps a town like Bennington, whose ambience runs from the
workaday to the artsy, should count itself fortunate to have so
visible a reminder of Revolutionary valor. (Paul O. Boisvert/The

<P>
   NEW YORK _ We were heaving to and definitely not giving up the
ship as the U.S. brig Niagara weathered stormy skies in Long Island
Sound before mustering in New York Harbor for Operation Sail 2000
over the coming July 4 holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The spanker sail at the stern trailed a puff of patriotic color:
a 15-star Old Glory from the War of 1812. And atop the foremast
fluttered a replica of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's proud blue
banner, ``Don't Give Up the Ship.'' After vanquishing the British
in the original Niagara on Lake Erie in 1813, Perry retired to his
cabin and penned his eloquent report: ``We have met the enemy, and
they are ours.''
</P>
<P>
   The air rang with commands shouted and repeated: ``Avast!''
``Brace up three points!'' and _ my favorite _ ``OK, hear the news:
Port watch eats!'' Even a clueless landsman knew that spelled
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara has been assigned a leading spot in the parade of
sail on Tuesday, behind the flagship, the U.S. Coast Guard bark
Eagle; the full-rigged Danish training ship Danmark and the Pogoria
of Poland.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5 million spectators are expected to throng New
York City's shores next week for what may be the greatest nautical
spectacle of all time _ an event drawing well over 120 tall ships,
some 42 warships from the United States and 25 other nations and
50,000 to 70,000 small pleasure craft.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will review the July 4 spectacle from the deck
of the aircraft carrier the John F. Kennedy, anchored near the
Statue of Liberty, as some 70 planes soar overhead in an
international flyover. The festivities will culminate at 9 p.m.
with what is being called the largest pyrotechnic display in
history: a Macy's fireworks bombardment shooting off more than
2,000 shells a minute _ more than 60,000 in all _ in New York
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Between the arrival of the armada on Monday and its departure on
July 9 there will be gun salutes and a blessing of the fleet, a
national bell-ringing, military band concerts and a concert by the
New York Pops, with a guest appearance on the podium by Walter
Cronkite, the event's honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Ships moored around Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Liberty
State Park and Bayonne, N.J., will be open to visitors. Also
scheduled are demonstrations of military and sportive prowess by
many of the 28,000 or so visiting seamen. After the events in New
York, many of the ships will sail on to Boston for another
assemblage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the most magnificent and important tall-ship
event in history anywhere in the world,'' said Charles Robertson,
chairman of Op Sail 2000. A longtime yachtsman and businessman,
Robertson was instrumental in the last Operation Sail, in 1992,
which commemorated the 500th anniversary of Columbus' landing in
the New World. Add the military component, said Capt. Woody
Berzins, the Navy spokesman for the ``gray hull'' or warship event,
officially called the International Naval Review, and you are
looking at ``the greatest maritime event in history,'' in the
unabashed words of the Op Sail 2000 slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's extravaganza will be the fifth Operation Sail, a
tradition established in 1961 by another old salt, President John
F. Kennedy, who did not live to see its actual debut in celebration
of the New York World's Fair in 1964. Subsequent Op Sails
celebrated the nation's bicentennial (1976) and the centennial of
the Statue of Liberty (1986). Future Op Sails are already being
planned, Robertson said, for the West Coast in 2004 or 2005 and
back again on the East Coast in 2008 or 2009.
</P>
<P>
   The International Naval Reviews go back to 1893, when the
warships of 10 nations sailed from Hampton Roads, Va., into New
York Harbor past President Grover Cleveland to commemorate
Columbus' second voyage. In 1907 American and foreign warships
again convened in Hampton Roads to mark the tercentennial of the
Jamestown Colony, a salute reprised there in 1957 for Jamestown's
350th anniversary. A fourth naval review, the largest to date, drew
warships from more than 40 countries to New York for the 1976
bicentennial, and a smaller fleet converged in 1986 for the
relighting of the renovated Statue of Liberty's torch. Next week's
International Naval Review, the sixth, was mandated by Congress in
1996 as an observance of the millennium and the nation's 224th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   With the focus on anniversaries, the submarine service, in its
centennial this year (the inventor John Holland sold his prototype
submersible to the Navy for $150,000 in 1900), celebrates with a
visit by the Jacksonville, one of the nation's 50 nuclear-powered
fast-attack submarines.
</P>
<P>
   But once again it is the wind-powered craft, throwbacks to a
storied wooden world, that are likely to steal the show. They go
from the largest of the tall ships, 27 Class A vessels starting
with the Esmeralda, a four-masted Chilean barkentine of 371 feet,
to 25 Class B ships of 161 to 100 feet, to 61 Class C Vessels of 90
to 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational craft that are not part of the official group with
assigned berths are also expected to swarm New York's waters in
record numbers, possibly as many as 70,000 by Coast Guard
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the windjammers, despite their antique look, are
actually modern-day re-creations, built as training vessels for
foreign navies. ``Sailing vessels like these teach them things they
wouldn't ordinarily know,'' said Paul Welling, a retired Coast
Guard Vice Admiral who skippered the Eagle for four years, training
600 cadets a summer. He now serves as chief operating officer of Op
Sail 2000. ``If you're on a screw-driven vessel you wouldn't be so
concerned about weather and wind-shifts.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the more authentic entries is the Wavertree, called the
world's oldest iron sailing ship, built in 1885. A pillar of the
British merchant fleet hauling jute from India to Scotland, it was
demasted in a storm off Cape Horn in 1910, faced junking for scrap
and was finally rediscovered in 1968 by the South Street Seaport
Museum, which is turning it into a floating museum and training
vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara, which I joined recently in New London, Conn., for a
sopping day sail before it headed off to Newport, R.I.;
Philadelphia, and New York for the festivities, is on the light
side for a Class A vessel and ranks about midway in length, at 198
feet. But it is surpassing in loftiness: its two masts top out at
118 and 113 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Both masts are square-rigged (the defining characteristics of a
brig), which means that the yards, the horizontal spars from which
the sails are set, can be set square to the centerline of the ship
as well as angled, or ``braced up sharp,'' to sail closer to the
wind. The 15 sails consume almost 13,000 square feet of canvas and
can propel the ship along at up to 13.5 knots, or more than 16
miles an hour, very speedy for a square-rigger of this size. Once
the Niagara bristled with 18 32-pounder carronades and two
12-pounder long guns that could hurl a cannonball more than a mile;
now only four replica 32-pounder Scottish cannons and two long guns
poke through the gun ports.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara, which makes regular cruises out of the Erie
Maritime Museum in Erie, Pa., comes freighted with history,
although with the exception of a few precious original timbers, it
is a re-creation.
</P>
<P>
   With the immature young republic and its recently dislodged
British overlords having stumbled into war again in 1812 over
simmering resentments and insults, Perry, commanding nine ships,
confronted six of the enemy's at Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie on Sept.
10, 1813. The beginning of the battle went badly for the Americans.
Perry, aboard his flagship, the Lawrence, miraculously escaped when
80 percent of the crew was felled by British fire. Striking her
banner, ``Don't Give Up the Ship'' _ and then doing precisely that
_ Perry evacuated to the Niagara, hauled up the banner and went on
to capture the British fleet (``Two Ships, two Brigs, one Schooner,
&AMP; one Sloop''), a victory that prepared the way for peace in 1814
and the nation's westward expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The Niagara was ignominiously scuttled in 1820 and raised and
rebuilt nearly a century later, in 1913, for the centennial of the
battle. Renovation dragged on through the Depression and World War
II. But by the 1980s severe decay required its dismantling, with
some original timbers salvaged for a full reconstruction, completed
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The ship surely seemed authentic enough, though, as I stepped
aboard in a downpour, seeking shelter under the canvas-covered main
hatch and enviously eyeing the crew in waterproof orange and yellow
foul-weather gear. In 1813 a crew of 155 manned the ship, about 100
of them on the guns. Today it sails with 16 professionals,
including the master, Capt. Walter Rybka, plus 24 volunteers who
sign on for at least three weeks at a time. Visitors are encouraged
to pitch in on the two watches, port and starboard, and even, with
proper safety harnesses, high up on the sails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them tasks, belt them up if they want to play,'' Rybka
told the crew. But he cautioned, ``Do not belt up someone who
doesn't want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the special guests on board was Cmdr. William F. Foster
Jr. of the Constitution, the granddaddy of tall ships. Known as
``Old Ironsides,'' it was commissioned in 1797 as one of the
nation's first six warships and is now restored and permanently
berthed as a museum in Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest revelation for a nonseaman was how much
brawn and know-how a tall ship requires to remain, well, shipshape.
There are sails to loose and set, halyards to haul away on and make
fast, line to coil, yards to brace up and brace in, watches to
stand and the tiller to steer. Below deck, where the clearance is
too low to stand upright, hot meals are cooked on a wood stove; the
crew is unceremoniously bunked in hammocks hanging like clusters of
cocooned caterpillars, and even the heads require manual pumping.
</P>
<P>
   That's all authentic, too (except that there are no more
floggings and no grog issue). ``They always kept them busy so they
wouldn't discover those sailorly vices,'' said John Beebe-Center,
the sun-bronzed Chief Mate, who learned sailing while growing up in
Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   If the spaghetti tangle of rigging seemed impossibly intricate,
it was perhaps only the 19th-century equivalent of today's computer
innards: to the people whose business it was to sail the ship, it
all made perfect sense. So, too, the laboriously loaded and fired
guns, which Rybka and his crew demonstrated to thunderous effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the sudden silence after the concussive blast, somewhere on
deck a cell phone trilled. Clearly, we were back in the 21st
century.

A NEW PHISH SEASON BEGINS, THE GROOVE STILL INSISTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ The Phish groove surged through the PNC Bank
Arts Center here Wednesday night as the Vermont band turned on its
juice for the first Northeastern date of its annual summer tour.
This groove, as always, had a distinctive effect on fans. They
twitched, twirled and watched themselves move their own hands in
mysterious patterns. Walking through this captivated group was as
challenging as jumping into the most raucous punk mosh pit. So long
as Phish kept pushing its buoyant, speedy beat, hardly anyone could
step out of the electrified dance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the nontwirler, ensconced in a safe corner, the groove
was one of the less interesting aspects of Phish's show. Like most
staples, it had a uniform flavor. To keep fans dancing, Phish had
to return to that accelerating rush, dominated by Trey Anastasio's
guitar-tweaking and Jon Fishman's hyperactive drumming. The groove
wasn't slippery, like great funk, or intriguingly hesitant, as
blues can be; it straightforwardly did its job.
</P>
<P>
   What made Phish interesting musically was everything that went
on around, behind and within the groove.
</P>
<P>
   Anastasio proved himself a seriously adventurous guitarist,
making a racket with sequencers, looping and pitch shifters. The
keyboardist Page McConnell countered Anastasio's futurism with
blasts from the past, tossing in some boogie-woogie or even cool
jazz. The rhythm section of Fishman and Mike Gordon on bass subtly
stretched out even while tending that groove, anchoring quick time
changes and intersecting riffs.
</P>
<P>
   What was truly intriguing was the fusion Phish achieved. When
the band emerged a decade ago, its goofily cerebral sound was a
liberal arts major turned into music _ eclectic to a fault and
earnestly dilettantish. Luckily, Phish has evolved beyond
collegiate showing-off.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's show still traveled rock's map from New
Orleans to Chicago and Nashville to San Francisco. A cover of the
Rolling Stones song ``Loving Cup'' represented the band's
mainstream side, while the chorus of ``Harry Hood,'' which might
have been lifted from the soundtrack to ``Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang,'' proved its enduring wackiness. But there was no distance
between the styles Phish claimed. Instead, speedy bluegrass melded
with anthemic, Who-style rock, and corny smooth jazz met its end in
a dissonant swell.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's rhythm was the safety casing for this experimentation; it
soon reasserted itself, even when Phish tried more traditional pop
songs. Old-fashioned songcraft isn't Phish's strength; Anastasio's
singing is nondescript, and the mix of Frank Zappa-style humor and
soft-rock melodies can induce a serious case of the cringes. Relief
came quickly whenever that happened, as the drums kicked in, the
guitar squeaked and the groove returned.

 &HT;    Rocker, Mets fans behave on first day
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The world's most infamous subway ride never happened,
the starting pitcher didn't show up, and the fellow everyone came
to heap abuse on didn't necessarily inspire the loudest boos.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one thing everyone at Shea Stadium was absolutely
certain of Thursday night: ``John Rocker sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   They all yelled it, even if they didn't all absolutely believe
it by the time Rocker and the rest of the Braves took the field for
the first game of their obsessively talked-about weekend series
against the Mets. Shouting it from the uppermost rows in the
right-field stands, sporting it on T-shirts they had purchased over
the Internet or outside Shea, 40,000-plus Mets fans made clear
their common view of the controversial reliever they had waited
half a season and shown up two hours early to jeer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, if someone had had a mike on John Rocker
for about a three-minute span when he was in the outfield a little
while ago, I think it would have changed a lot of people's minds in
this place about him,'' Ernie Bertothy, 21, said.
</P>
<P>
   What Rocker did, about an hour before game time, was walk over
and shake the hands of Bertothy and his friend, Mike Doran, who had
come to the game from nearby Naugatuck, Conn., to see a good game
and witness some even better insults being hurled at the big
left-hander as he loosened up in the outfield. Throw in the several
autographed balls he threw _ gently _ to fans in the field-level
seats and the apology he appeared on the giant scoreboard reading,
and it was a rather tame return to New York.
</P>
<P>
   From Rocker to the fans, nearly everyone was well-behaved. Yet
some of it was self-imposed, as many Mets fans said they were just
trying to keep things in the proper perspective. This series was
all about the Mets' big chance to take over first place, they said,
not Rocker's big mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I don't even want to see John Rocker this weekend and
that's not because I'm so mad at him,'' said Tom Vitale, who was
sitting about five rows from the field near the visitors bullpen,
wearing a hard hat he'd jokingly decorated with an ``I Love New
York'' sticker. ``It's because if Rocker's in a game, that means
the Braves are probably leading.''
</P>
<P>
   To Vitale's friend, Matt Pacifico, Thursday was as much a chance
to disprove what Rocker had said about Mets fans' supposed bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   If, in fact, it was disprovable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I'm worried about,'' said Pacifico, who had
refused to bring along a hard hat and who now turned around to
study the upper decks where some fans were brandishing beer cans
and signs with Rocker-specific messages like ``Hey Rocker, Can I Be
Your Battery Mate?'' ``If anyone throwing batteries from up there
doesn't have a great arm, it's coming right at my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, from beginning to end, it was no lovefest in Queens.
Coming off the No. 7 subway line _ the same one Rocker had pledged
to ride Thursday, setting off citywide agita _ the first thing
anyone saw was a sign reading ``Dump John Rocker!'', part of a
protest organized by a consortium of groups representing Latinos,
gays, even Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to denounce the hate language John Rocker used, but
also any hate language that might be used by fans in the stadium
tonight,'' said New York Police Sgt. Edgar Rodriguez, president of
the Gay Officers Action League.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much better inside the stadium, where former Met Bobby
Bonilla got the loudest boos of the night during the pre-game
introductions. Ande where being from the Bronx couldn't save Jason
Vargas from becoming a target of fan vitriol, all because he wore a
Greg Maddux jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all I find out Maddux is sick and not pitching
tonight,'' Vargas sighed while nibbling a bit nervously on a piece
of red licorice. ``Then I'm getting a LOT of heckling about the
shirt. They yell `Take the jersey off,' `You shouldn't be here,'
and `Rocker sucks!'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's guilt by association,'' Vargas laughingly concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rocker's pre-game schoomzing with fans made some of them
just hate him more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you can go down near the field during batting practice
and get autographs, but because of all this Rocker stuff, they
weren't letting people down there,'' complained Mets season ticket
holder Michael Conslato, pointing to his disappointed 5-year-old
son. ``I wish he'd go to the minors and not ruin our whole
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   If only he'd been a little less cooperative.

SENATE PASSES DONOR DISCLOSURE BILL 
 
(INCL. TRIM INDICATORS) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LETITIA STEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly approved and
sent to President Clinton a bill to force tax-exempt organizations
to disclose their sources for money used for television and radio
advertisements to influence political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to sign the bill, the first restrictions on
campaign financing in 21 years. The legislation will become law
immediately, meaning the secretive groups would have to identify
their donors during the fall election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all those who believe in reform, today is only the first
step, but it is a great first step,'' said Sen. John McCain, the
Arizona Republican who led bipartisan efforts to overcome stalling
tactics by GOP leaders in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which cleared the Senate 92-6, will no longer allow
groups organized under Section 527 of the tax code to raise
unlimited amounts of money for political purposes without
identifying the donors and how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 385-89 early Wednesday to approve the bill,
which requires disclosure only for donations made after Clinton
signs it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Other tax-exempt interest groups and companies _ which some
Republicans tried unsuccessfully to include in the bill _ will
remain free to run ads without disclosing their donors as long as
the groups stick to issues advocacy and do not directly advocate a
candidate's election or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passage of this bill proves that public interest can triumph
over special interests,'' Clinton said in a statement urging
lawmakers to approve other election-law changes. The legislation
also was praised by Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, a conservation organization that has conducted
political activities since 1995 under a Section 527 organization
called the Environmental Voter Education Campaign, ``will eagerly
comply with the new law,'' said Dan Weiss, the club's political
director.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents predicted that the legislation would have a ``chilling
effect'' on some groups' ability to raise money, and that when the
law is challenged in court, it will be thrown out as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very nervous that this will make it much more difficult
for groups to make legitimate complaints about Congress and federal
agencies,'' said Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, a
527 organization that promotes free-market policies. Moore said
donors doing business with the government could be punished if it
is known they oppose administration policy.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the law changes, our lawyers will advise us on what the
best course of action will be, and we'll take that action,'' said
Dan Zielinski, spokesman for Citizens for Better Medicare, a 527
group criticized by Clinton this week for trying to derail a
Democratic plan for providing prescription drug benefits for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who led opposition
to the bill, predicted it would be struck down by the courts. ``It
will take us down the constitutionally questionable path of
requiring disclosure by advocacy groups,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   While he voted against the bill, McConnell urged his Republican
colleagues to support it as they wrapped up business before going
home for a week of campaigning over the July 4 holiday. Voting for
the bill ``will insulate them against charges that they are in
favor of secret campaign contributions,'' McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When McCain successfully pushed a similar measure through the
Senate earlier this month, eight Republicans who previously opposed
his efforts _ but this year face re-election _ sided with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are eight senators who never voted with us before who
found themselves on the road to Damascus,'' McCain said, referring
to a religious conversion described in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tax-exempt 527 groups were targeted, campaign-finance reform
advocates said, because their ability to raise and spend unlimited
amounts of money from unidentified donors violates two principles
of campaign finance laws _ limits and disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will enable voters to learn ``exactly who is
behind the last-minute smear campaigns and anonymous ads that
increasingly characterized our federal elections,'' said Common
Cause President Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   From January through March, more than $114 million had been
spent by over 60 of the so-called 527 groups, acording to a report
by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of
Pennsylvania. Only a handful of the groups' identifies are known.
</P>
<P>
   Although the legislation approved by Congress may shed some
light on these groups, cracking down on them is not likely to
reduce the amount of money or its influence in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it will do to the flow of money to the elections is
simply act as a router that will redirect the money to another
source,'' said Steven Weiss, spokesman for the Center for
Responsive Politics, a non-partisan organization that studies the
impact of money in the election process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a dam in the river of money that is flowing into
politics,'' he said. ``It is simply a levee that moves the money to
another place.''

UNDATED: abortion methods.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publicly, supporters of the bans often say they want to ban a
procedure known as a D&AMP;X abortion, for intact dilation and
extraction.
</P>
<P>
   In that procedure, used starting at about 16 weeks of pregnancy
when the fetus' head has grown too big to pass safely through an
undilated cervix, doctors trying to keep the fetus as intact as
possible for various reasons extract it feet first and then use a
sharp instrument to collapse the fetal skull.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the bans say they are often so broadly worded
that they seem to also ban so-called D&AMP;E abortions, for dilation
and evacuation. In this procedure, which is used much more commonly
for abortions after the first trimester of pregnancy, the fetus is
dismembered during the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Supreme Court opinion, written by Justice Stephen G.
Breyer, agreed that that had been a flaw in the Nebraska law.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer's decision said that Nebraska, because of its broad
phrasing, imposed an ``undue burden'' on a woman's right to choose
a D&AMP;E abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that state legislation creating a ban was
often written in very general terms because its supporters are
trying to discourage all abortions, not just those they describe as
partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In revised laws across the country, Heller said, ban proponents
``will now try to come up with different language that they will
claim is limited to this one specific procedure, but that really
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   His group, which has challenged many bans nationally, is
preparing to challenge the Ohio law, which, he said, remains so
broadly worded that it could be read as banning more than the D&AMP;X
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bans denied they intended to limit women's
rights to other methods of abortion. Grasz, the Nebraska deputy
attorney general, said that abortion-rights groups make that claim
to motivate their supporters with the fear that all abortion rights
are at stake, not just a limitation on a particular method of
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the states were trying to do,'' he said, ``was
ban partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts, he said, would continue.
</P>
<P>
   People on both sides of the abortion issue were also divided
Thursday regarding the Supreme Court's requirement that any ban, to
be constitutional, must permit the use of the D&AMP;X procedure if it
is deemed necessary to preserve the health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   The life of the woman is not at issue: all state laws banning
the procedure _ including Nebraska's _ made allowances for its use
should the pregnant woman's life be otherwise threatened.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's ruling addressed the issue of the mother's
health, a lower medical threshold _ and one more open to broad
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bans said that rule was needed to preserve a
meaningful right to choice guaranteed by the landmark 1973 abortion
decision, Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the bans said they regarded that part of
Wednesday's opinion as a trap for them.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, they said, if new laws are too narrow in
defining the health of the mother, they will be struck down like
the Nebraska law, which did not include a health exception.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they continued, if the health exception
written into new laws is too broad, the bans would be ineffective
because doctors could invoke the exception routinely to use the
banned procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In a companion suit to Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court defined
``the health of the mother'' broadly, including factors like a
woman's age, and physical, psychological or emotional condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dorinda C. Bordlee, a special assistant attorney general in
Louisiana who has defended the state's 1997 ``partial birth'' ban,
said she was considering advising the Louisiana Legislature to
amend its law to define the mother's health strictly as
``significant long-term physical risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a law would surely be challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would force the Supreme Court to reconsider what it
considers `health,''' Bordlee said.

PHOTOGRAPHER OF STARS WILL NOMINATE THEM

   By GLENN COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So they gave one last decent Broadway gala to bid
farewell to the theatrical season, and Aubrey Reuben was there, as
ever, with his Canon Sure Shot 120, as ever, blasting cold flash
right into the eyes of celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Simon? Snap. Nathan Lane? Snap. Marsha Mason? Snap. Robert
Klein? Snap. Charles S. Dutton? Snap. Calista Flockhart? Snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, OK,'' Reuben said, eyeing the dinner crowd the
other night at the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS fund-raiser
honoring Simon. ``Now on to what's really important _ the food and
the wine!''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben, in his trademark gray Ralph Lauren suit and floral tie,
has been called a ``gentleman paparazzo'' but rejects that. ``I
don't take pictures of people without their permission,'' he said.
``I don't stake out homes or hotels. I don't shoot into people's
windows.''
</P>
<P>
   What then would be your job description, Reuben? ``Celebrity
photographer,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly Aubrey Reuben, observer, is the thing observed. Or
as Bill Evans, the press representative for the Neil Simon event,
put it: ``It's always been good to see Aubrey, but now we really
have to play up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that Reuben was recently named to the prestigious
nominating committee for next season's Tony Awards, one of only 30
chosen. ``I take it very seriously,'' Reuben said. ``It's a great
honor. The theater is literally my life.'' Pause. ``I even adore
the ushers.''
</P>
<P>
   True, some in the ever-treacherous theater business have reacted
to the news as if the scullery maid was named sous-chef. But his
new liege defends him. ``Aubrey is eminently qualified, as a lover
of the theater who has seen every show for years and years,'' said
Roy Somlyo, president of the American Theater Wing, which founded
the Tonys in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   But really, Somlyo _ a celebrity photographer? ``I don't think
that in any way demeans the Tony process,'' Somlyo said. ``It would
be wrong for the committee to be an elitist group.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough. But how, oh how, to present Reuben in full? Is it
Reuben the gala-seeking missile, who has ``never been to a party I
didn't like,'' as he puts it? Is it Reuben the indefatigable, who
has snapped as many as eight events in an evening while consuming
untold merlots before having an Irish coffee at 2 a.m. at Rosie
O'Grady's, the saloon?
</P>
<P>
   Or is the real Reuben the avuncular Broadway historian, the
going-out guide who for decades has written about theater, opera
and ballet for Temas, the Spanish-language magazine _ the Reuben
who has for 20 years served on the executive committee of the
70-member Outer Critics Circle?
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the identity anomaly is the little-known
public-school thing. Reuben began as a teacher of Spanish in New
York City schools in 1957 and retired as assistant principal of
John Bowne High School in Queens, N.Y., in 1987. Along the way, he
arranged for discount Broadway tickets for his classes and invited
show-business luminaries to lecture in his schools.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben began his shutterbug career ``as a groupie with a box
camera,'' he said, flashing snaps backstage after seeing shows he
covered for Temas. But the early 1980s brought ``the revelation
that I could be paid for this'' when his first picture appeared in
The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   When Reuben ``first showed up around the edges, he wasn't taken
all that seriously,'' Evans said. But now Reuben is absolutely
beset by what one might call event-faxation _ his number is on
press agents' automatic-send list. And his snaps appear, among many
other places, in The Post, where he is paid a retainer; an agency
also beams his pictures to newspapers and magazines around the
world. Reuben has had such world coups as the cover of People
magazine (Bess Myerson and Carl Capasso in a smoochy condition).
Giant scoops can earn him more than $20,000 a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben steadfastly maintains that he is 33 years old. (He is
68.) ``I qualify for the Guinness Book of World Records because I'm
the only 33-year-old father whose son is 42 years old,'' he says
proudly. The son, David, teaches on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben stubbornly inflicts his English accent on America though
he came to New York at age 15 from his native English city,
Manchester (to join his sister, a GI bride), and he is now a
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Even without his photographic royalties, Reuben says he is
comfortably off, thanks to pensions and the investments he made
with his wife of 39 years, Maria Elena, who died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He makes zero claim to photographic expertise. ``I have not the
slightest idea of how a camera works, and all I know about film is
that it has numbers on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then what is his definition of an artistically excellent photo?
``The picture editor likes it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What are the crucial aesthetic elements of composition? ``Deep
cleavage is a decided plus,'' he said. ``If it's the scandal of the
moment, that doesn't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Have his snaps ever attained the level of art?
</P>
<P>
   Reuben exploded in his life-of-the-party bray. ``Next
question!''
</P>
<P>
   And how many nights a year does he go out? Three hundred
sixty-five, he says. ``I love leap years, because then I'm out
366.''

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For ages, nations have dreamed of building invulnerable shields
to protect themselves from hostile forces. There was the Great Wall
and the Maginot line and, in America, the Safeguard anti-missile
system and Star Wars.
</P>
<P>
   All fell short. Now, the Clinton administration and its military
advisers may try again, this time with a limited anti-missile
weapon they think can go a long way toward immunizing America
against attack _ at least from missiles launched by adversaries
like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, which are known to be developing
intercontinental missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon and experts outside the government say
this defense technology has reached a new level of maturity. They
argue that the combination of miniaturized parts and fast rockets
can produce an agile, light-weight weapon that can find and ram an
incoming warhead at about 7,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are skeptical that it can work. Even its advocates
compare the overall challenge of building and orchestrating the
system's millions of delicate parts to developing the atom bomb and
putting men on the moon. One question is whether the defending
weapon can survive the boost into orbit. More fundamental is
whether it can be made to distinguish between a warhead heading for
the United States and a cloud of decoys, a task that it has about
100 seconds to accomplish. In fact, since research on so-called
hit-to-kill weapons began in 1976, attempts to destroy mock
warheads in space have failed more than 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial flight test of the technology is set for next Friday,
when a ground-based interceptor missile is to thunder aloft and try
to destroy a mock warhead in space. If it goes well, President
Clinton may decide this fall whether to build the first phase of
the so-called national missile defense. Though the administration
is weighing approval of preliminary construction, it says a final
deployment decision may fall to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The central feature of the proposed system would be a supersmart
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' designed to be carried atop a
rocket and guide itself to a collision with an incoming warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents are confident that it can work, even though the first
two tests of this design were discouraging. One was a partially
lucky hit and the other a complete miss. If next week's test fails
as well, the chorus of critics will no doubt grow.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the proposed project is both challenging and
enormous, growing in four steps from an initial 20 missile
interceptors in 2005 to a much larger system by 2011. By the time
it is complete, the shield would require at least 2 launching
sites, 3 command centers, 5 communication relay stations, 15
radars, 29 satellites, 250 underground silos and 250 missile
interceptors.
</P>
<P>
   It would be based in Hawaii, Alaska, California, Colorado, North
Dakota, Massachusetts, Greenland, Britain and possibly Maine. Two
radars would be set up in Asia at sites so far undisclosed,
possibly in Japan and South Korea. Building it would cost at least
$60 billion and running it would take at least 1,455 people, and
probably hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase alone is supposed to take eight years, the
government says, though most experts consider 12 to 16 years a
safer pace and less risky.
</P>
<P>
   But the anti-missile program's director, Lt. Gen. Ronald T.
Kadish of the Air Force, says a rushed job is doable, just barely.
``We're confident in the path we've chosen,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``Our program will do what we ask it to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the interceptors can pick out enemy decoys that
are sure to accompany any attack, Kadish said he was certain that
new anti-missile technology would enable the system to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not well understood,'' he said. ``Critics assume the
system will remain static forever. We've never assumed it would
never change.'' He added, ``We can play the countermeasure,
counter-countermeasure game.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say this approach will only beget costly arms races
that will erode confidence in any anti-missile weapon.
</P>
<P>
   If the anti-missile issues can be resolved, and a weapon built
that really works, the nation might at last establish something
approaching a limited nuclear sanctuary. If the effort proves
futile, it risks wasting billions while upsetting a balance of
terror that has kept an uneasy peace among nuclear antagonists for
more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   The exoatmospheric kill vehicle, a 130-pound wonder just 54
inches long, is the star of the Clinton plan. It is made by
Raytheon at a plant in Tucson. In space, it would guide itself
toward the target, its tiny computer analyzing sensor readings and
firing thrusters.
</P>
<P>
   Its big challenge is to disregard the decoys amid the nuclear
warheads, which the sensor tracks through their heat rays and sees
as twinkling points of light, like stars.
</P>
<P>
   Zipping along at about 2 miles per second, the kill vehicle is
to slam into the nuclear warhead in space and demolish it by force
of impact.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-missile designers praise the kill vehicle as the apex of
miniaturization and accuracy. By contrast, they say, the world's
first successful hit-to-kill interceptor, in 1984, had to unfurl a
15-foot-wide steel umbrella to raise the odds of collision.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a world of difference, the way the technology has
moved,'' said Edward L. Wilkinson, project manager of the 1984
system, which succeeded after three failures.
</P>
<P>
   Donald R. Baucom, an anti-missile historian at the Pentagon,
said the new kill vehicle's deadly agility would be rooted in its
miniaturized parts and light weight _ pounds vs. earlier tons.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even its staunchest backers acknowledge that the kill
vehicle is blind to enemy warheads for most of its flight.
Raytheon, its maker, says it can pick up the telltale heat
emanations of targets only in the last 100 or so seconds before
impact.
</P>
<P>
   So the weapon must still rely on radars and satellites to find
its quarry. The goal of this network is not only to aid kill
vehicles but to push the defensive battle as close as possible to
enemy territory so as to give military officers time to fire more
than one interceptor at a specific warhead, raising the odds of
success.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is known as shoot-look-shoot. In theory, anti-missile
officials say, three or more hits might be attempted against a
given warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, director of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization, told Congress in February that if interceptors were
80 percent dependable, two tries would provide 96 percent
confidence and three would give 99 percent assurance of a
successful kill.
</P>
<P>
   The anticipated power of the weapon system is a state secret.
But documents that the State Department gave Moscow in January said
the full system would be able to destroy up to 50 enemy warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The system's full coverage is detailed in a Pentagon map. Its
colors range from red to blue for ``bad'' to ``good'' levels of
protection and show North America as solid blue _ including all 50
states, Canada and Mexico. Cuba, however, is a conspicuous green,
its coverage relatively poor.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques S. Gansler, the Pentagon's acquisition director,
recently conceded that the Defense Department and its contractors
were pushing the technological limits. ``It's clearly a high-risk
overall program,'' he told reporters this month, adding that having
everything work right on the coming flight test was ``not a high
probability.''
</P>
<P>
   The test flight next Friday is to be the most demanding yet and
the first to aid the hunt in space for the mock warhead by relaying
data from a ground radar to the kill vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After that experiment, 16 more intercept attempts, each costing
about $100 million, are to fly before the planned initial
deployment in 2005. The Pentagon says data from these increasingly
complex tests will help designers debug the anti-missile system and
improve the weapon's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it eventually works perfectly, critics say, the kill
vehicle and its radar and satellite assistants can still be undone
easily by decoys and other countermeasures that even an
inexperienced attacker like Iraq or North Korea is sure to employ.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the security
studies program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
released a 175-page study on likely enemy countermeasures, saying
such tricks were much easier than making a missile.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it said that disguising a weapon to look like a
decoy _ just wrapping a Mylar balloon around a warhead so it drifts
inconspicuously among other decoy balloons _ would foil the
defense. The Pentagon has announced no plans to test the kill
vehicle against such a stratagem.
</P>
<P>
   Federal intelligence agencies also worry about such
countermeasures. Last September, a National Intelligence Estimate
said that nations developing missiles could also respond to a
defensive shield with at least eight types of tricks and decoys,
including simple balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the system say critics naively credit foes with great
powers. The technology of deception is far from easy, they say, and
defensive arms can evolve to foil any offensive trick.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the anti-missile pioneer who consults for the current
program, said new generations of kill-vehicle sensors would have
chips of up to 1.05 million pixels, far beyond the current level of
65,536 pixels and the 72 pixels of the 1984 success. So in the
future, he said, sensor resolution will soar, aiding the kill
vehicle's ability to ferret out subtle differences among warheads
and decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game that never ends,'' he said, faulting the critics.
``You get action and reaction all the time. So it's a little unfair
for them to state with finality that they know of a simple, cheap
countermeasure that can defeat the system from here to eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at M.I.T., dismissed such
statements as glib, saying the reality was so grim that contractors
and Defense Department officials were resorting to widespread
anti-missile fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In two reports to the White House, Postol has charged that the
Pentagon is covering up its own discovery that the sensor cannot
tell warheads from decoys and, to hide this flaw, is rigging all
interception tests of the kill vehicle. These flight tests began
last year and are to run to 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has strongly denied his charges, saying
that the kill vehicle, teamed with its proposed array of radars and
orbiting sensors, can do the discrimination job just fine. And
Kadish and other Pentagon officials have hinted repeatedly that the
job will be aided by technologies and techniques that are secret.

FOR 1776 COPY OF DECLARATION, A RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BARRON   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What price liberty? A copy of the Declaration of
Independence that was printed in 1776 and discovered behind a $4
flea-market painting in 1989 was sold Thursday for $7.4 million, 23
percent more than Sotheby's highest pre-auction estimate and a
record for a copy of the document.
</P>
<P>
   It was also one of the highest prices paid for a document sold
over the Internet. There seem to be no definitive records of online
sales, although eBay, the online auction house that sells
everything from tiny figurines to souped-up cars to century-old
copies of National Geographic magazine, said several months ago
that it believed that a Picasso had sold for just under $2 million
in an online deal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's final price vaulted a one-item Internet auction past
some of the most talked-about traditional auctions of recent years,
including the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis sale with the $574,500
humidor and the $442,500 rocking chair, the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor auction with the $415,000 mahogany table, and the Marilyn
Monroe auction with the $1.15 million dress, the one she wore the
night she sang ``Happy Birthday'' to President John F. Kennedy in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   The copy of the declaration that changed hands Thursday had been
auctioned once before, also at Sotheby's. That sale, in 1991, was
conducted the traditional way, with an auctioneer who pounded a
gavel after saying ``going, going, gone.'' The price was $2.42
million, which stood as a record for the declaration until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the same auctioneer was in charge, but the bidding
was done with computers. The bids were posted on Sotheby's Web
site, www.sothebys.com, the moment they were submitted. The buyers
were the television producer Norman Lear and the Internet
entrepreneur David Hayden.
</P>
<P>
   Lear, who created shows including ``All in the Family'' and
``Maude,'' said he and Hayden planned to send the declaration
around the country in connection with ``a theatrical event that
will be unashamedly patriotic.'' Lear said the traveling show would
be produced under the auspices of his nonprofit organization,
People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   Lear, at his farm in Vermont during the auction, and Hayden, who
was on a plane from New York to California, matched the only other
bidder in increments of $100,000. Sotheby's, which had required
prospective bidders to register by Tuesday, did not identify the
loser.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's billed the auction as a kind of high-tech, high-value
experiment, but it was really only medium tech. The bids for Lear
and Hayden were submitted by someone who works for Lear and who was
at a computer terminal at Sotheby's, at York Avenue and 72nd Street
in Manhattan. The auction opened in the morning with a $4 million
bid from Lear and Hayden. The other bidder's first appearance _ a
$4.1 million bid _ came two and a half hours later, and two hours
after that, Lear and Hayden countered with $4.2 million. The
bidding Ping-Ponged between the two sides. At 4:57, three minutes
before what was supposed to be the end of the auction, Lear and
Hayden raised their bid to $4.6 million. With 52 seconds before the
deadline, the other bidder climbed to $5.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sotheby's online rules, it will not close an auction until
10 minutes have gone by without a bid, and 22 more bids were posted
before it ended at 5:47, 10 minutes after Lear and Hayden topped
their competitor's final $7.3 million bid. With Sotheby's 10
percent commission, their total came to $8.14 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thought we would stop about six because we saw no
possibility of its going past six,'' he said, referring to $6
million. ``How to explain it? There is no price on liberty. You've
got to take a pill with this, but nonetheless that's the way we
were feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lear said he had heard about the auction last week and had
called Hayden at the beginning of this week, ``when I began to be
concerned about where this might go.'' Hayden _ the founder of
Critical Path, an Internet messaging service, and a co-founder of
the company that created Magellan, an Internet search engine that
was sold to Excite in 1996 _ agreed to go in with him.
</P>
<P>
   David N. Redden, the auctioneer Thursday as in 1991, and one of
the auctioneers in the sale of items from Onassis' estate in 1996,
said the pace of yesterday's auction seemed less furious than that
of a traditional sale, in part because of the lag while bids were
posted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact was, this slow-motion Internet-style auction actually
works,'' said Redden, who is a vice chairman of Sotheby's and head
of its book and manuscript division. ``It gives people time to
think and adjust and maybe redefine what their limits are. In this
case, there was five or six or seven minutes between the bids,
which creates a different dynamic in terms of decision-making.
There isn't the up-against-the-wall, make-a-decision-now sense that
there is in the auction room.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The document that Lear and Hayden bought is known as a Dunlap
broadside. It was one of 25 copies surviving from the 500 or so run
off by a Philadelphia printer named John Dunlap on the night the
Continental Congress voted to break away from British rule. Redden
said that the printer was rushing _ the ink was still wet when the
copy sold Thursday was folded. The first line, ``In Congress, July
4, 1776,'' can be seen in reverse at the bottom of the page.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunlap broadside was the way that word of the colonies'
independence was spread. Copies were sent to local officials and
military leaders, including General George Washington, who Redden
said read his copy to his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Washington's copy is missing the bottom third, one of
the most bedraggled,'' Redden said.
</P>
<P>
   The one sold Thursday was in as good condition as the copies at
Yale University and at the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan, he
said. The flea-market shopper who bought it in 1989 told him that
he had bought the painting behind which the Dunlap broadside was
hidden because he liked the frame. He later discarded the painting
and the frame.

 &HT;    Another side of shooter emerges
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman, William Cooper Jr. and Scott McCabe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Staring into the eyes of the girl who scorned
his puppy love, Nathaniel Brazill squeezed the trigger of a cheap
silver handgun and shot his teacher in the head.
</P>
<P>
   That girl, Dinora Rosales, and other close friends and
acquaintances of the 13-year-old student stood behind their English
teacher, Barry Grunow, as he fell dead from that bullet on the last
day of school.
</P>
<P>
   They, along with teachers, friends and relatives who knew the
seventh-grade student crafted an image of an angrier Nathaniel
Brazill than has been previously reported. He imagined killing,
bragged about how he would use a stolen gun and joked _ they
thought _ about inscribing hit lists with students' names,
according to witness statements culled from 799 pages of documents
released Thursday. Yet they all maintained that he'd been a
gentleman, a nice kid and a joker with a smile on his face. The
talk of violence almost always seemed in jest.
</P>
<P>
   The police evidence, released under the state's public records
laws, will be used by prosecutors and defense attorneys to define
the boy, once again, in preparation for his adult trial on a
first-degree murder charge, expected sometime next year. Brazill
has already admitted shooting Grunow May 26, hours after he had
been sent home by a guidance counselor for throwing water balloons.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Worth Middle School surveillance tape, which police say
shows the shooting, has not been released. Brazill's defense
attorney, Bob Udell, has argued that it would inflame the public
and prevent his client from receiving a fair trial. A judge is
expected to rule today on whether to make the tape public.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting Grunow on the right side of his nose at 3:25
p.m., he told police he was angry at the teacher for laughing at
him when Brazill aimed the gun at his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a smile on his face and was laughing and that made me
mad,'' Brazill said.
</P>
<P>
   Udell said Thursday night he has not read the documents released
by the State Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is someone going to tell me what the motive for this
murder is?'' he asked. ``There's an old saying: You can believe
some of what you see but none of what you hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come to the trial. We'll see who's telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He has previously indicated he will argue that Brazill fired
accidentally. He also is likely to question the credibility of the
police witnesses, most of whom are 13-years-old.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill's father, Nathaniel Brazill Sr., said he had not seen
the newly released documents and did not want to comment for this
story.
</P>
<P>
   UNREQUITED CRUSHES
</P>
<P>
   Brazill was apparently suffering from teenage heartache this
school year. He had a group of close-knit friends, but wanted more
than platonic relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Friends recounted numerous conversations in which he talked
about girls and he kept pictures of four of them by his home
computer. Brazill wanted to talk to two of those girls, Rosales and
Vonae Ware, when he ran into Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had asked me out like to be his girlfriend but I told him
no,'' Rosales told police.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill continued to bring her cards throughout the year, a
wooden heart he made in shop class and flowers and balloons on the
last day of class.
</P>
<P>
   Police took two of those cards, apparently written near the end
of school, as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school year with you has been the best of my life...I
love you and I think I'm going to lose my mind. I love you, take
care,'' he wrote before signing ``Love Nate.''
</P>
<P>
   He had an earlier crush on Ware, but she returned the chocolates
he gave her. Although he was friends with Ware's boyfriend, Bobby
McRoy, he became jealous, students told police. He told students
he'd kill Bobby by the end of the year and he wrote about those
plans in one of his letters to Rosales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna kill Bobby. Bobby always lyin on me and stuff,'' he
told Suzy Fleureme, according to her statement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the girls' rejections, Brazill remained close friends
with Ware and Rosales. He desperately sought them out when he
returned to school after being dismissed. On the way in, he told
his friend Jules Nole to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him walking real fast cause and I thought it was strange
cause he had no classes right in the back there in the portables,''
Nole said.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazill arrived at Grunow's classroom, Rosales and Ware
were near the door, trying to leave a few minutes before dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow saw Brazill at the door and told him to leave. As Brazill
held up the gun and racked the bullet into the chamber and ready to
fire, the girls told him, ``This isn't funny, this isn't funny.
This isn't a joke,'' according to Rosales' statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he just looked at me and then he just shot Mr. Grunow
and left,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of middle school students told police they heard or saw
the gunshot. One said she smelled the smoke from the discharged
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   WRITTEN EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   When Brazill turned himself into police later that day, he had a
preprinted card for Safe Harbor, a teen runaway hotline _ something
Ware said he liked to hand out to other students as a joke.
</P>
<P>
   He told police that after he shot Grunow he thought he would
kill himself by riding his bike from school into a lake and
drowning himself.
</P>
<P>
   Later, police took an unsigned, unfinished letter from his room
that also mentioned suicide. Found in a notebook in his home, it's
dated April 15, 1988 and has an out of town address. But it's
addressed, ``Dear Grunow,'' and includes specific references to
many of Brazill's friends and teachers from the 1999-2000 school
year. The author of the letter, which contains several grammatical
errors, identifies himself as a seventh-grader: ``Their was nothing
about this school year that I liked. People were mean to me. The
were always beating on me. I think I might commit suicide,'' it
says in part. Some of the anger in the letter is directed at
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Brazill had shown anger earlier in the year. Geography teacher
Brett Packard recalled an incident in January when Brazill and
another student fought over a fruit drink. Packard took it and told
them if they were not going to share, then the soda was his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got intensely mad when I would not give it back,'' Packard
said. ``I didn't back down on it and I poured it out onto the
grass. He was really mad. And he stewed on that for 2 or 3 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brazill confessed to police about shooting Grunow, he told
them he learned to load the gun, stolen the weekend before the
shooting from a family friend, by watching cop shows on television.
He kept pamphlets from gun manufacturers in his room, with prices
he jotted down in the margins.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as a year ago, before he even had a gun, he told his
cousin how he imagined he could use one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to rob a bank,'' said James Josey, a
12-year-old first cousin.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about shooting police and ``sounded like he was
talking for real,'' Josey said.
</P>
<P>
   The idle bragging of a little boy? Perhaps, but hours before the
shooting, Brazill ran into a neighborhood kid, 18-year-old Brandon
Spann, and promised to ``(mess) up the teachers at the school.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tiffany Jenkins, 13, didn't know whether to believe him when
he showed her the gun a few days before and said it might be used
to kill her cousin Bobby McRoy.
</P>
<P>
   Kervin Dieujuste also saw the gun and heard Brazill brag. He
meant to tell the principal, but forgot, he told police.
</P>
<P>
   Students, even those who knew Brazill had a gun, didn't think he
was capable of shooting anyone. That's why talk of his ``hit list''
seemed like just that, talk. Many students heard Brazill mention
such a list, though, and police seized a sheet of paper from his
room with two names next to dates and a heading that said ``Add to
hit list Kervin.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the shooting, classmate Sandy Astain-Jules saw
Brazill writing down the names of ``people I hate'' while she was
talking to him in class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I looked at the paper and he put, 'People I wanna kill.'
So I thought . . . he was playing around. See he put my name on
there and some other people's name on there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Grunow, the 35-year-old father of two, was not on the list.

DESIGN A LAST CHORD FROM NISSAN'S ROCKER-DESIGNER-PITCHMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Mich., Calif.)   By PHIL PATTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nissan's television commercials have made Jerry Hirshberg the
most recognized auto designer in America. More than his Infiniti
J30 luxury sedan, his Nissan Xterra sport utility or even his
strange Gobi truck design, they are likely to be the images by
which he is remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg's career at Nissan comes to an end Friday with his
voluntary retirement; he turns 60 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg came to Nissan in 1980, when the Japanese company set
up a Southern California studio, Nissan Design International, or
NDI, to learn from the American market. Most automakers have
California studios now, but Nissan's was among the first. Hirshberg
was determined to design all kinds of products, which he believed
improved the quality of his automotive designs.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in other products has helped to make Hirshberg a
polarizing figure in auto design. The true car designer, tradition
holds, dreams of nothing else _ he has ``gasoline in his veins.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   He has also been one of the industry's most outspoken and
articulate practitioners; his explanations of his own work are
sometimes taken as glibness. Auto design is a hermetic world of
traditions and conventions, not unlike that of Paris couture or
Japanese anime.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   General Motors hired him in 1963 in a program aimed at enriching
the pool of ideas by bringing designers without automotive
backgrounds into the studio.
</P>
<P>
   His career had already taken an odd detour while he was earning
degrees in mechanical engineering from Ohio State University and in
industrial design from the Cleveland Institute of Art. He moved
from the classical music of his high school years into rock 'n'
roll and in 1959 had a hit song, ``Sparkling Blue.'' Using the name
Jerry Paul, he toured as an opening act for the likes of Fabian and
Frankie Avalon. ``Sparkling Blue,'' he proudly says, continued to
be played on oldies stations and produce residual payments into the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave up music for automobile design, joining GM's Pontiac
Division in the '60s when its general manager, John Z. DeLorean,
was making waves. Hirshberg worked on the original Firebird of 1967
and the striking 1968 GTO muscle car, then moved on to Buick.
Through it all, he worked under the legendary (and tyrannical) Bill
Mitchell, who encouraged competition among GM's disparate design
studios. But Hirshberg thought the competition intimidated
designers and squelched new ideas. The very names of cars he worked
on _ LeSabre, Firebird _ summed up the aggressive ethos of the
place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, he got a call from a headhunter. Nissan had decided to
establish a studio in California to adapt vehicle designs to the
increasingly important American market; would he set it up? Once he
got Nissan Design International going, in the LaJolla section of
San Diego, he worked to redesign the process of design. He laid out
some of his ideas in a 1998 book, ``The Creative Priority: Driving
Innovation in the Real World'' (HarperBusiness), whose pages are
full of phrases like ``mind mapping,'' ``porous planning'' and
``polarized thinking.'' California psychobabble, his Detroit
critics grumbled, though not on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he calls the studio itself his most successful design.
But his style is unconventional. Once, to break a midafternoon
creative logjam, he took his entire staff to a screening of
``Silence of the Lambs.'' He administered a test to determine the
``colors'' of potential staffers' personalities, lest the
organizing greens be overwhelmed by innovative but helter-skelter
reds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To keep minds open and ideas fresh, NDI also took on a variety
of nonautomotive design work, from children's furniture to laptop
computers, yachts and golf clubs. (Its most commercially successful
project may be the best-selling Taylor Made Bubble Burner golf
clubs.)
</P>
<P>
   Another nonautomotive job was a commission to rethink the design
of The Los Angeles Times. Beginning with the basics, he concluded
that a person reading a newspaper ``appears to be smelling it.'' He
ground several metropolitan dailies into confetti and asked a panel
to evaluate their odors. The Los Angeles paper did very well;
testers called its smell ``sweet.'' (The New York Times rated less
well, due to a higher percentage of recycled paper.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His innovations have sometimes been small but significant. As
the studio set out to redesign the Quest minivan, word came back
that users wanted 3 inches of added space. The specific figure
puzzled him. Bringing in owners and their vehicles, Hirshberg found
that what they really wanted was room to accommodate objects, like
another row of grocery bags, without adding to the van's length. So
the studio added storage in the form of an adjustable shelf _ a
feature that has been widely imitated.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg is famous for the verbal spin he puts on his designs.
He called the Xterra, a small sport utility that has been a big hit
since its introduction last year, ``a garage tool that says, `Treat
me rough' _ it's designed to look better dirty than clean.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Infiniti J30 made its premiere, he says, ``I presented
the car at the Waldorf-Astoria like a Hollywood director.'' The
sedan was conceived in the mid-'80s in an effort to create
``instant heritage'' for Nissan's new luxury division. The studio
came up with a series of round shapes that, in an era when most
cars were wedges, evoked the falling rear ends and rounded
coachlike bodies of old Jaguars and Delahayes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the J30s introduction, he presented the design theme as a
Zen-like drawing: a bold, calligraphic sketch of a line and an egg.
</P>
<P>
   New vehicles based on Hirshberg's designs will arrive in
showrooms until 2003, and he will continue to appear in ads. He
turned down a chance to become worldwide director for Nissan
design, he says. That job went to Shiro Nakamura, formerly of
Isuzu, whom Hirshberg recommended. Heading Nissan Design in
California will be Tom Semple, a longtime colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg's last major design at Nissan Design International is
the American studio's entry in an intramural competition for the
design of Nissan's next ``Z'' sports car. It will compete with an
entry from Nissan's Japanese studio, and the winner will be
displayed at the Detroit auto show in January. Hirshberg promises
that the Z will be very different from a design shown in Detroit
two years ago. It will not be a ``retro'' version of the old Z car,
he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Retro lost its edge when we crossed the millennial
threshold,'' he said. ``Now we run the danger of cars becoming
costumes on wheels.'' He considers it good for automotive design
``to become aware of its history _ for cars to begin referencing
other cars for a change, not rocket ships or airplanes.'' But he
says auto designers may ``squander this new credibility very
rapidly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``How long can a wink last? The danger is that we will
visually giggle ourselves back into oblivion.'' He criticizes the
popular Chrysler PT Cruiser as a pastiche of retro references.
</P>
<P>
   Hirshberg will continue to work as an adviser to Nissan. But he
plans to spend most of his time painting. Not with a spray can, as
in a recent ad for the Sentra compact sedan, but with oils. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been this huge white canvas in my studio for 20
years,'' he said. Devoting himself to painting ``was a dream from
the days I first began working at General Motors.'' If that doesn't
work, he can always go back to rock 'n' roll.

 &HT;    Will parties split labor vote this fall?
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republicans descend on Philadelphia next month to
nominate Texas Gov. George W. Bush for president, but some
important Democrats are paying courtesy calls here this week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton comes to town today. Vice President Al Gore
and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) were here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   All three came to speak to the national convention of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union,
whose 1.3 million members make it one of three largest in the 13
million member AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton, Gore and Gephardt would come calling underscores
the pivotal role that organized labor will play for the Democrats
in the upcoming fall elections. Labor turnout, especially in key
battleground states such as Pennsylvania, will be critical to
Gore's chances of winning the White House and Gephardt's goal of
recapturing the House and becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The visits from Clinton and Gore also point to the predicament
Gore faces just four months before the November elections. Both
Clinton and Gore are seeking to mend fences with organized labor _
a core constituency of the Democratic electorate _ after alienating
labor voters over their support of permanent trade relations with
China.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, appears to have solidified his support among
core Republican voters and is spending more of his time reaching
out to constituencies not normally allied with the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bush spoke to an important gathering of
Latinos in Washington, and in Cleveland two days later he made a
pitch to people with disabilities, proposing pilot programs to help
the disabled with transportation to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Voter.com Battleground 2000 poll, conducted by
Republican and Democratic pollsters, found union voters splitting
their support between Bush and Gore, an indication of the road Gore
still must travel to shore up support among labor voters.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who is committing vast union
resources toward Gore's election, spoke to the AFSCME convention
Thursday and delivered a passionate endorsement of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the stakes have never been higher,'' Sweeney told the
4,000 delegates. ``We have to work harder than we have worked in
our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney then went off to lead a town hall meeting of labor
activists dubbed the ``Texas Truth Squad,'' featuring testimonials
from Texas workers on Bush's record on labor issues in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The town hall, with others to follow in other cities around the
country, was among the first public events of a huge AFL-CIO
campaign to turn out union voters against Bush and support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several months, the AFL-CIO has dispatched
hundreds of paid coordinators to 70 congressional districts around
the country. The field activists will be responsible for
registering union members to vote, developing accurate phone lists
of union voters, and distributing millions of mailings to union
households. Pennsylvania, with its 23 electoral votes, ranks among
the top five or six battleground states in the fall campaign. The
state is home to some one million union workers, and Gore enjoys
the support of most of the state's union leadership.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO state President Bill George said the federation had
dispatched about 20 field staff this month to begin the
labor-intensive process of mobilizing the state's unionized
workers.
</P>
<P>
   George said Gore is still facing some skepticism among union
voters because of his support of the China trade legislation,
especially among the state's 85,000 steelworkers. ``But they look
at the other candidate and they see a complete disaster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``I think it's going to go down to the wire.''

 &HT;    Stakes high for space station module launch
 &HT;    By Mike Toner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NASA declared this week that the cornerstone of the
International Space Station, the long-delayed Russian-built service
module, is finally ready to go _ a critical step in what space
agency Administrator Daniel Goldin says will be a ``landmark'' year
in a project that is 10 years late and tens of billions of dollars
over budget.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the $60 billion station depends heavily on a
successful launch of the 21-ton module from the Baikonur Cosmodrome
in Kazakhstan. The module contains the living quarters for the
station's first crews and the flight control systems to keep it in
orbit.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, a successful launch may mute _ at least
temporarily _ the chorus of critics who say NASA has mismanaged the
project from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But so far very little in the history of the space station has
gone according to plan. Depending on whom one talks to, it is
either the most complex and costly construction project ever
attempted, or NASA's biggest boondoggle. The history of the
43-foot-long cylinder now being readied for launch July 12,
suggests it is a bit of both.
</P>
<P>
   A `STAR' OR A `BLUFF'?
</P>
<P>
   The Russians call it ``Zvezda,'' or Star. To NASA it is simply
``the service module'' _ the third and crucial component of the
costliest and most ambitious space construction project in history.
To critics it is a pawn in a ``cosmic bluff'' that has strained
U.S. Russian relations, drained billions of dollars from other
space programs, and tarnished NASA's can-do image with both
Congress and the American public.
</P>
<P>
   By any name, it is desperately needed for the continued assembly
of the nascent space station, whose first components _ parked at an
altitude of 250 miles _ now circle the globe every 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, the service module, which is
about the size of a large tour bus, will reach the space station by
late July. In the next few months, four supply flights _ two by the
Russians and two by the U.S. space shuttle _ will make the station
ready to receive its first three-man crew in late October, at which
point, Goldin said, ``the United States and our partners start to
reap the benefits of long duration research in space.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda's belated delivery, two years after it was supposed to be
in orbit, also reflects the latest in a generation of unfulfilled
promises and managerial missteps by the world's leading spacefaring
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The service module has been built in fits and starts by
disgruntled Russian laborers who sometimes worked without
paychecks. When money ran low, the Russian government insisted it
had no funds to complete construction. But while NASA fumed, the
Russian space agency used its rubles _ and hardware earmarked for
the International Space Station _ to keep its aging Mir space
station alive in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda, which will supply the power needed to maintain the
station's orbit, was supposed to have been launched in early 1999.
The snowballing delays and concerns that it might never be finished
forced NASA to ante up more than $100 million to design and begin
building a substitute. In May, NASA had to press the space shuttle
into service to boost the station to a higher altitude because _
absent Zvezda's power supply _ it was in danger of falling out of
orbit. Shuttle astronauts also had to replace failed batteries
aboard the 2-year-old Russian portion of the station.
</P>
<P>
   COST WORRIES GROW
</P>
<P>
   As NASA has struggled to patch up _ and sometimes gloss over _
Russian missteps in the project, congressional critics of the
station have spared no scorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA's management of this program has all the appearances of a
Keystone Cops movie,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.),
chairman of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics. ``The
American people deserve better. Our future in space demands it.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion, the station will be the largest structure ever
assembled in space. More than 350 feet in length and weighing more
than a million pounds, it will be four times larger than Russia's
Mir space station and, like Mir, visible to the naked eye from
Earth. Assembling it will require more than 80 Russian and American
launches and 1,900 hours of spacewalks over the next seven years .
</P>
<P>
   If the past two years are a prologue, however, the space station
will face additional delays, further cost increases and growing
doubts about the U.S. space agency's role in the project during and
after construction.
</P>
<P>
   $100 BILLION FINAL TAB?
</P>
<P>
   When President Ronald Reagan committed the nation to building a
permanent station in space in 1984, it was going to be finished by
the early 1990s at a cost of about $8 billion. NASA's current plans
call for completion of the station in 2007. And the price tag has
grown to $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the General Accounting Office, which crunches numbers for
Congress, says the delays, cost overruns, technical problems and
poor planning have made it almost impossible to predict the final
cost of the program. Counting operating costs for the first 10
years of operation, the GAO's best guess is that it will exceed
$100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Space ventures have never fit neatly into Congress' budgetary
boxes. The Apollo moon program and the space shuttle were both
billions of dollars over budget. But compared to those ventures,
the space station is in a class by itself.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has already spent at least $20 billion on designs,
redesigns and the actual hardware that will be fitted together,
like giant Tinker Toys. The project now consumes $2.3 billion of
NASA's $14 billion annual budget. Only one expense _ space shuttle
operations _ is greater. But for the next seven years, the shuttle
fleet will be used primarily to ferry parts and supplies to the
space station.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Congress has limited what NASA can spend
on the space station to around $2 billion a year. But because the
spending cap had forced NASA to push needed work on the project
farther into the future, the overall cost is still growing.
</P>
<P>
   The critical role played by Russia, which in Reagan's day was
``the evil empire'' but today is the United States' principal
partner in the space station project, has added a costly and
frustrating new layer of complexity.
</P>
<P>
   FINGERS POINT AT RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   Congress initially agreed to fund the space station in 1993
because of the Clinton administration's assurances that the
participation of Russia and 14 other nations would reduce the cost
to U.S. taxpayers, speed construction and help promote
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strategy has failed on each single point,'' said James
Oberg, a independent space policy analyst and expert on the Russian
space program. ``Having the Russians involved has made the project
cost more and take longer.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA itself estimates that Russian-induced delays in building
the station will add about $3 billion to its final cost _ more than
Russian participation was expected to save U.S. taxpayers when the
project was proposed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have held America's space station hostage to
their delays,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.), who has
criticized the space station as a ``black hole'' that continues to
swallow U.S. tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, members of Congress have introduced various
bills that would link future funding for the station to Russia's
halting the sale of missile technology to Iran, terminate all
Russian involvement in the project or kill the station outright.
None of the proposals is given a chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, legislation introduced by Rep. Tim Roemer (D-Ind.),
who files the same bill every year, called for cancellation of
funding for the station. This year, as before, it was defeated in
the House, 325 to 98. With $20 billion already spent _ and NASA
contracts for some piece of it strategically placed in every state,
the space station has a powerful constituency.
</P>
<P>
   But Oberg says NASA, in its haste to prove to Congress that it
could get some piece of the station in orbit in the later 1990s,
set a series of unrealistic target dates for the cash-strapped
Russians. The Russians promised to meet them, but never did. Oberg
said the result was that NASA and its Russian counterpart have been
racing to meet arbitrary deadlines. ``Each knew it was a cosmic
bluff, and each was waiting for the other to flinch and ask for a
slip,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the timing grew crucial, the Russians tried to wring
more money out of NASA. Congress approved $60 million to tide the
Russian Space Agency over in 1998. This year, even NASA chief
Goldin, who has staunchly defended the Russian role in the project
from the beginning, lost his patience. He is particularly irked
that the Russians borrowed from the funds approved by Congress in
1998 to keep the aging Mir station in orbit _ and then tried to
sell NASA a Soyuz launch vehicle for $65 million, about three times
what it charged a private company for the same equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin has repeatedly asked the Russians to abandon Mir and
focus on the International Space Station. In June, Energia, the
Russian company that operates the station, announced plans to keep
it aloft indefinitely for use as a space tourism destination. In
cooperation with a Dutch company, the Russians _ proving to be
quick learners when it comes to capitalism _ will offer trips to
the station to anyone willing to pay $20 million for the privilege.
So far, they have one customer, 59-year-old U.S. investment manager
Dennis Tito.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at our wits' end,'' Goldin told Congress in March. ``We
need that service module up there. To say we are frustrated and
disappointed is an understatement.'' Goldin has warned the Russians
that if Zvezda doesn't fly soon, NASA will build a substitute
interim control module itself. Such a module, however, will still
require Russian couplings to dock with the space station. The
Russians have offered to sell NASA a set of the hardware for $65
million.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Space Agency Director Yuri Koptev says the U.S. space
agency has had its own technical difficulties and delays in
manufacturing parts for the space station. NASA's mismanagement,
frequent redesigns and cost overruns also are drawing fire from
congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, U.S. dependence on Russian performance in the
International Space Station program has cost taxpayers an estimated
$5 billion and delayed the program by three years,'' said Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation Committee. ``NASA needs to spend more time on
technical management of its programs instead of counting their
appropriation funds.''
</P>
<P>
   SAFETY ALSO A CONCERN
</P>
<P>
   But even as Zvezda undergoes its final checkout at Baikonur, it
is clear that the space station's problems are not over. The Proton
rocket that will carry Zvezda has been successfully flown in its
current configuration only once. Because two predecessors exploded
in flight last year, NASA insisted _ and will get _ additional
testing before committing the key piece of station hardware to the
newly overhauled Proton launcher.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's engineers say Zvezda does not yet meet all of the
agency's safety requirements, including one for better protection
from orbital debris that could endanger the crew or even ``cause
the loss of the space station.'' The shielding can't be installed
on the ground because it would make the module too heavy to launch.
NASA plans to upgrade the shielding in 2004, after the module has
been in use for more than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Li, associate director of the agency's security division
says as Zvezda is currently built, a sudden loss of cabin pressure
could disrupt the station's guidance system and doom the station.
NASA plans to fix the problem in 2001. As costs and delays add up,
scientists are worried that the station's problems are undermining
its original purpose: to serve as an orbiting laboratory for
biotechnology, materials research, Earth observations and space
science. To the dismay of scientists, NASA has been borrowing from
its own science programs, including some critical efforts to study
the hazard of long-duration space flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancellation of scheduled research flights in order to
fund construction is a clear deterrent to developing space-based
projects,'' said David Kaufman, president of the 60,000-member
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman says NASA's diversion of life science research funds for
construction could actually wind up jeopardizing the health of the
very people who will man the station once it is finally completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE,' starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Raja
Gosnell (PG-13, 97 minutes). This fitfully amusing film, starring
the comic whirligig Lawrence, could best be described as
``Stakeout'' goes ghetto, with a touch of ``Tootsie'' for flava _
er, flavor. Lawrence plays Malcolm, an FBI agent with a penchant
for doing undercover work in full body makeup. Here he impersonates
Big Momma, a stubborn old Southern woman. Why? Big Momma's
granddaughter is on the run because her ex-boyfriend, Lester, a
murderous bank robber, has escaped from prison. Malcolm believes he
can use her to get to Lester. This isn't much of a movie; it looks
like a series of baseball card shots and may have the worst rhythms
ever in a film directed by a former editor. (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating new film, based on stories by the Spanish writer Manuel
Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Lozano), a sensitive young boy
coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries
of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the
proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses a
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this. (Mitchell)
</P>
<P>
   `DINOSAUR,' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaur's movements
and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _ will
impress skeptical grown-ups. Despite some potentially upsetting
scenes of carnivorous mayhem, the film will delight children. (A.O.
Scott)
</P>
<P>
   `FANTASIA/2000,' with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial
version of Disney's 1940 groundbreaking fusion of animation and
classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the
original film (the wonderful ``Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' starring
Mickey Mouse). ``Fantasia/2000'' is more backward-looking than
futuristic. The two best segments are ``Rhapsody in Blue,'' a witty
Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld
set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's
``Firebird'' Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around
the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the
planet's life forms. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `FREQUENCY,' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by
Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future'' meets
``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ``The
Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental
supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is a morose
young policeman who makes contact with his dead father, a
firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the
accident that cost him his life. The two collaborate on changing
other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There
are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up
fighting for his life, Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire
intensity suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the
movie together, such as it is. (Mitchell)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   `GONE IN 60 SECONDS,' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi,
Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Directed by Dominic Sena (PG-13,
119 minutes). A remake of a movie so insubstantial that its title
seems to refer to the length of time it would linger in memory.
Cage, who has gone prematurely blond, is the world's best car
thief, dragged out of his apparently lucrative go-cart business and
returns to auto theft to save the life of his brother ( Ribisi).
With a magnetic cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless hot-rodding
entertainment. (Mitchell)
</P>
<P>
   `HIGH FIDELITY,' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben
Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107
minutes). Although the setting has been moved from London to
Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995
novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Cusack has one
of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager
and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ``Top 5'' breakups in his
disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest
relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of
not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip
musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth. (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If
``There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous
mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking
and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the
Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ``Me Myself and
Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish
sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may
prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Carrey, in
one _ or is it two? _ of his most charming and repellent
performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split
personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie
and plausible bewilderment by Zellweger. (Scott)
</P>
<P>
   `M:I-2,' starring Tom Cruise, Thandie Newton and Sir Anthony
Hopkins. Directed by John Woo (PG-13, 120 minutes). Cruise returns
as the daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt in Woo's loud, flashy,
incoherent new blockbuster. The film is jampacked with movie
references _ to Hitchcock, to the first ``Mission: Impossible''
movie and to Woo's superior Hong Kong action films _ but it's at
once overheated and flat. The plot, involving killer viruses, is
baffling rather than twisty. The introduction of a love interest
(Newton) who also happens to be the bad guy's ex-girlfriend adds an
element of melodrama that's more grating than affecting. Some good
car chases and explosions, though. (Scott)
</P>
<P>
   `SHAFT,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey
Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree A
sequel/remake to the 1971 semi-classic, starring the always
dependable Jackson. He's the nephew of the original Shaft
(Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He
leaves the force to track down a racist WASP murderer (Bale), who
joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful
Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically
correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert
archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two
villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But
Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of
retro and modern cliches. (Mitchell)
</P>
<P>
   `SHANGHAI NOON,' starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Directed
by Tom Dey (PG-13, 110 minutes). Chan is one of the great physical
comedians, and this martial arts western spoof is a high-spirited,
marvelously silly showcase for his talents. Chan plays an Imperial
Guard dispatched from Beijing to the Old West to rescue a princess
played by Lucy Liu. But the heart of the movie is the interplay
between Chan and Wilson, who depicts his inept outlaw sidekick with
goofy, spacey charm. (Scott)
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the
brutality of Communism. Fiennes' performances, and those of Ehle
and Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. ``Sunshine'' is a
serious, humane and thought-provoking attempt to make sense of
complicated and painful historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `TITAN A.E.,' with the voices of Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore and
Bill Pullman. Directed by Don Bluth and Gary Coleman (PG, 90
minutes). This animated sci-fi fantasy, set in the 31st century,
imagines that Earth has been destroyed by aliens and what is left
of humanity is scattered about the universe in drifter colonies.
Guided by a magic ring left to him by his father, Cale (Damon), a
teen-age space explorer, searches for the Titan, a hidden spaceship
with the key to humanity's future. The technology is innovative and
there are some gorgeous special effects. But the screenplay and
characters are too bland for the story to catch fire. (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `U-571,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub. (Mitchell)

BIG PEGASUS PRICE: PLUS OR PROBLEM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD - The sale of Fusaichi Pegasus for a record price
reported at $60-70 million is either really, really good news or
really, really bad news for horse racing fans. But cool your
celebration or hand-wringing. One thing the sale is not is part of
a trend.
</P>
<P>
   It took a combination of circumstances - unlikely to be repeated
soon - to produce the extraordinary price promised by the Kentucky
branch of an Irish breeding operation for the right to stand the
Kentucky Derby winner at stud near Lexington starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   -Fusaichi Pegasus isn't just any Derby winner but an unusually
impressive one, and the first winning Derby favorite since
Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   -The colt has raced only seven times - winning five - and hasn't
exposed weaknesses that a longer career would inevitably give away.
</P>
<P>
   -The death of Mr. Prospector at age 29 last year might have
increased the demand for his bloodline, and Fusaichi Pegasus is a
son of that great stallion.
</P>
<P>
   -Fusaichi Pegasus' owner, Fusao Sekiguchi of Japan, was looking
to part with the horse completely, not to retain a share of the
breeding rights, and had no connection with any breeding farm. Thus
he cared about nothing but the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   -The rising popularity of standing stallions in the Southern
Hemisphere during the Northern Hemisphere breeding offseason has
increased potential revenue, giving farms the chance to turn
profits on ever-more-enormous investments.
</P>
<P>
   -The growth of horse-owner partnerships has increased the number
of mare owners willing and able to pay the $200,000-per-foal fee
that Ashford Stud, a division of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud,
reportedly will demand for Fusaichi Pegasus' services in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   -Interest in the colt produced unusually frenzied, auction-style
bidding among breeding farms in Kentucky and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   -The breeding market in general is relatively healthy right now.
</P>
<P>
   This sale, which bested the 1983 price of $40 million for
Shareef Dancer, reflects the widely upbeat attitude about racing
economics, and that's why some view it as good news for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people say racing is done, but it isn't done if
people are willing to pay that much money for a stallion,'' said
Joe Orseno, the trainer of Red Bullet, the colt who upset Fusaichi
Pegasus in the Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it says every Derby winner is going to be worth
$60-70 million,'' said Todd Pletcher, who trained four of the
horses Fusaichi Pegasus outran in the Derby. ``I think it says that
the market is healthy enough that when the right horse comes along,
there are going to be people who are willing to pay $200,000 to
breed to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Why might it be bad news? Because the biggest star in North
American racing is going to be retired at the end of his 3-year-old
season so his purchasers can begin to recoup their purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   The plan apparently calls for Fusaichi Pegasus to remain under
Sekiguchi's ownership and Hollywood Park-based trainer Neil
Drysdale's management through the Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup at Churchill
Downs. Unraced since a minor hoof injury kept him out of the
Belmont Stakes, Fusaichi Pegasus is expected to resume training in
the next week, and race at least once before the Breeders' Cup
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' said Jim Bond, the trainer of Behrens,
about the Fusaichi Pegasus deal. ``The only problem I have with it
is the thought that a horse can have one or two (major winning)
races and command this amount of money. It just seems that
durability has nothing to do with it anymore. I don't know if
that's good for our industry. I like to see horses who stay around
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens certainly is one of those, which is Bond's point.
Behrens is 6 years old, has won 9 of 23 starts, and is the richest
active thoroughbred with more than $4.2 million in purses. But
nobody is talking about $60 million for his future in the breeding
shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durabilitywise, he'd be worth twice as much as this,'' Bond
said.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Hollywood Park has scheduled six stakes during the
holiday racing week that began Thursday and runs through Tuesday,
the Fourth of July. Expected highlights include Saturday's Affirmed
Handicap (with Dixie Union prepping for the July 23 Swaps),
Sunday's Beverly Hills Handicap (with Happyanunoit, Astra and
possibly Spanish Fern fighting for the top of the local
fillies-and-mares turf division), and Tuesday's American Handicap
(led by Dark Moondancer).
</P>
<P>
   Out of town, Tuesday's Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park is the
week's big race. Behrens, in his first start since finishing second
to Dubai Millennium in the Dubai World Cup, faces Lemon Drop Kid
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: K One King, last week's big addition to the
Hollywood Gold Cup, is this week's big dropout after coming up with
a right foreleg injury.
</P>
<P>
   But Bond-trained Pleasant Breeze has been added to the field for
the $1 million Gold Cup on July 9. The 5-year-old son of Pleasant
Tap finished second to Golden Missile in the Pimlico Special before
finishing seventh in the Massachusetts Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The Gold Cup probables (until further notice): Big Ten, Cat
Thief, Chester House, David, Early Pioneer, General Challenge, Out
of Mind and Pleasant Breeze. &QL;

BOTTENFIELD CAN'T STOP MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- When the Angels traded Jim Edmonds to the Cardinals
for Kent Bottenfield on March 23, they hoped they were getting the
same pitcher that won 18 games and was named to the National League
All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   So far the only noticeable similarity between Bottenfield in
1999 and Bottenfield in 2000 is the loss count -- Bottenfield had
seven losses all of last year, and Thursday afternoon he got his
seventh loss of 2000 in a 7-2 setback to the Seattle Mariners
before 44,387 at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (4-7) didn't pitch poorly -- he gave up four runs
and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. But two of the hits were home runs
by John Olerud, including a tie-breaking two-run homer in the sixth
inning that gave the Mariners the lead for good at 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, who waved off reporters after the game, was so
upset after Olerud's homer, he told the next batter, Mike Cameron,
to hurry up and get in the batter's box. Cameron yelled back and
the benches from both teams stirred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling him to get in the box, and Cameron got mad,''
Angels catcher Matt Walbeck said. ``They were jawing back and
forth. It was just gamesmanship. It was nothing dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottenfield was a little frustrated and wanted to get back to
pitching,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners hit two more homers off the Angels bullpen, giving
starter Gil Meche and the three relievers plenty to work with. The
win moved the Mariners past Oakland and into first place in the
A.L. West. The Angels are six behind the Mariners and 5{ behind
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield did start off the season pitching well, holding
opponents to three runs or fewer in seven of his first eight
starts. But since then, he's done it only once his seven starts.
Since beating the Mariners here on May 5, Bottenfield has won only
once -- June 2 vs. the Dodgers when the Angels scored 12 runs.
</P>
<P>
   A bout with shoulder tendinitis caused him trouble toward the
end of May and early June, but since returning from the disabled
list with a healthy shoulder, the results aren't any better -- he's
0-2 with an 8.44 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbers, Scioscia said Bottenfield's on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he pitched a strong ballgame with the exception of a
couple pitches,'' Scioscia said. ``He made some strides today. I
think his confidence needs to get to the level it was last year and
early this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Walbeck said Bottenfield's performance Thursday was similar to
many of his starts early in the season when he was throwing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his command was good and he hit all his spots,''
Walbeck said. ``He pitched well today. His rhythm was fine. He made
a couple mistakes and they made him pay. Sometimes you just have to
tip your hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he's frustrated. Today was a big start for him. He's
disappointed in the outcome, but I hope it doesn't carry over to
his next start. He still made pitches and gave us a chance to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez's RBI single in the first inning gave the
Mariners a 1-0 lead, but the Angels tied it in the third inning.
Walbeck led off with a bunt single, took second on a walk to Benji
Gil, went to third on a sacrifice by Darin Erstad and scored on a
groundout by Orlando Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud gave the Mariners the lead back with the first of his
home runs, a solo shot in the fourth inning. The Angels tied it
again with a run in the sixth, the inning keyed by Garret
Anderson's double.
</P>
<P>
   But Olerud, who had only five homers all season going into the
game, got Bottenfield again with a two-run homer and a 4-2 lead in
the bottom of the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Javier added a two-run homer off Mark Petkovsek in the
seventh and Robert Machado hit a solo homer off Derrick Turnbow in
the eighth for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored only eight runs the three-game series, and
Thursday it was Meche who kept the Angels hitters in check. Meche
gave up two runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. Reliever Jose
Paniagua (1-0) got the win.

VITTORIO GASSMAN, ITALIAN ACTOR, DIES IN ROME AT 77 
</HEADLINE>
   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vittorio Gassman, a versatile film star who was also one of
Italy's leading classical stage actors, died Thursday in his home
in Rome. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his agent, Franca Rodolfi.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that lasted more than 50 years, Gassman was expert
in both comic and tragic roles, moving effortlessly from stage to
screen while also acting as a director, a producer, a translator of
plays and leading man in his own traveling repertory company.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was often disparaging about his years in Hollywood,
he wore his fame lightly and was proud of his success in comedy.
``The art of the comic is no less than that of the tragedian,'' he
said. ``Gordon Craig said that an actor has to be a clown to put
himself into another's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was known to American and international audiences as a star
of the Italian films ``The Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' ``The Easy
Life'' and ``Il Successo'' (``The Success''). In 1975, he was named
best actor at the Cannes International Film Festival for his
performance as a blind man in ``Profumo di Donna,'' later remade in
English as ``Scent of a Woman'' with Al Pacino. It was one of many
prizes that Gassman earned in his long and distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   Gassman was frequently underrated as an actor, perhaps because
of his striking appearance: he was darkly handsome, 6 feet 2 inches
tall, and there were often references to his ``arrogant good
looks.'' He could also make acting look easy. Dino Risi, who
directed him in ``The Easy Life,'' said: ``Gassman is an actor of
great talent, determination, ambition and intelligence. He is so
good he can imitate `naturalness' to perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not so much an imitation as an ability to fit himself
into whatever role he chose to play: an easily distracted burglar
in ``Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' an irresponsible playboy in
``The Easy Life'' and a conman in ``Love and Larceny.'' In that
last film he was a man of more than a dozen faces, assuming the
guises of Santa Claus, a Japanese bridegroom and an autocratic
general. In ``Let's Talk About Women,'' he played nine roles. Which
one was the real Gassman? The answer was, of course, whichever one
he chose to be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many of his peers, he also had an important
career in the theater, in plays by Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Ibsen
and Pirandello, among many others. In a 1965 article in the New
York Times Magazine, the author Melton S. Davis called him
``Italy's incomparable Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing Gassman's image on screen, Davis said, ``Possibly
no other actor in Europe could portray so well a man who loses his
dignity while trying to hold on to shreds of self-respect. He
performs with sensibility and interior tension; his face, despite
its classic lineaments, is unendingly mobile and expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly he returned to the stage. In addition to his many
Shakespearean roles, he performed in contemporary plays: he was
Stanley Kowalski in the Italian version of ``A Streetcar Named
Desire.'' In 1964, he read from ``The Divine Comedy,'' in a New
York celebration of Dante's 700th birthday. On several other
occasions, he acted in New York (with his one-man show, ``Viva
Vittorio!'') and performed on stages throughout Europe and South
America.
</P>
<P>
   For his work on stage, he was praised and also criticized for
his florid style of performing. The actor Giorgio Albertazi said,
``I'm not the first to accuse Gassman of being a ham. He plays his
hand so forcefully that the intentions of the work fall out of
sight, leaving room only for the great, for the magnificent, for
the incomparable interpretation of Vittorio Gassman.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism, Gassman said, ``In a country where the
most desired honor is to be considered simpatico, I have built my
career and reputation on being considered antipatico.'' On screen
he was able to combine the two, allowing moviegoers to understand
characters they might normally consider to be reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Genoa on Sept. 1, 1922. Briefly he studied law
and also considered a career in journalism. At the suggestion of
his mother, whose family had discouraged her from becoming an
actress, he went to Rome's Academy of Dramatic Art. At first, he
felt uncomfortable on stage, but gradually realized that he enjoyed
acting and found that he had a natural talent. He made his
professional stage debut in 1943 in ``La Nemica,'' and then worked
with a company headed by the director Luchino Visconti.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, after acting in more than 40 plays, he entered the
movies, largely to finance his work on stage. His first
breakthrough came in 1950 playing a criminal in Giuseppe de Santis'
``Bitter Rice'' (with Silvana Mangano), an unsparing slice of
neo-realistic life. That was followed by ``Anna,'' also with
Mangano.
</P>
<P>
   His first film in the U.S. was ``The Glass Wall'' in 1952. In
quick succession, he married the actress Shelley Winters and signed
a contract with MGM. ``Sombrero'' with Yvonne de Carlo was followed
by ``Rhapsody'' with Elizabeth Taylor. Both the marriage to Winters
and the Hollywood career soon ended.
</P>
<P>
   Then and later he was dismissive of his work in Hollywood,
regarding it as a misadventure. ``They didn't understand that a
European actor could be anything but a cliche Latin lover,'' he
said. ``After a couple of years I was anxious to go back to Italy,
and they were anxious to send me back, so it was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a free-lance actor, he was in ``War and Peace'' (with Audrey
Hepburn) and ``The Miracle'' (with Carroll Baker). Taking a break
from his film work, he fulfilled a long-standing dream by forming
his own theater company, Teatro Popolare Italiano. Using a portable
stage, he toured plays through Italy. In 1957, he directed himself
in a film version of Jean Paul Sartre's adaptation of Alexander
Dumas' ``Kean.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, with a seeming suddenness, he revealed his great talent
as a comic actor, and his ability to spoof himself, beginning with
``Big Deal on Madonna Street.'' Mario Monicelli's waggish tale of
an inept gang of thieves also featured Marcello Mastroianni and
quickly became a worldwide success. The director followed that with
``The Great War,'' with Gassman playing an indolent soldier in the
Italian army (the film also also starred Alberto Sordi and
Mangano).
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Easy Life,'' in 1963, he played one of his most
challenging roles, one that was to become a kind of signature. As
Bruno Fortuna, he was a wastrel with a lingering charm, a rascal
who takes a young law student (Jean-Louis Trintignant) on a
breathless and ultimately destructive journey through the high (and
easy) life.
</P>
<P>
   His other films included ``A Wedding'' and ``Quintet'' for
Robert Altman, ``The Family,'' Paul Mazursky's ``Tempest,'' Barry
Levinson's ``Sleepers'' (in which he played a Mafia don) and ``La
Bomba.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his third wife, Diletta D'Andrea, and four
children.
</P>
<P>
   Gassman, who often spoke about the art of acting, once said,
``As an actor you live your life watching yourself live your life
and watching others watch you, too. Acting is based on lying, a
noble type of lying, which is why I decided to tell the truth; it's
my chief luxury.''

HOUSE VOTES TO SPEND $1.3 BILLION ON DRUG WAR IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following is an added starter on The New York Times
front page)  By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved an $11.2 billion spending bill
Thursday night that includes more than $1 billion in emergency aid
to battle drug traffickers and their rebel allies in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to pass the same measure on Friday and
send it to President Clinton for his signature before Congress
adjourns for the weeklong July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy has raged over the centerpiece of the legislation,
$1.3 billion to help train and equip Colombian army and police
forces. A crucial component is a fleet of sophisticated transport
and attack helicopters to ferry Colombian troops.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in both major parties have warned that the aid to
Colombia will be a dangerous escalation in an unwinnable
Vietnam-style conflict that has already claimed thousands of lives
in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters, including House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and
Clinton, have pushed hard to help an important Latin American ally
stem the tide of drugs flowing into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to do anything to combat drugs, we must be
responsive to the people who have pledged to fight this plague,''
said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., who heads the House
Appropriations Committee, which oversees foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   And Hastert, in a statement after the vote, said: ``The crisis
in Colombia will not go away if we stand idly by and do nothing. It
is time to reach out a helping hand to Colombia. This Colombia aid
package is an investment in our future _ a future free from the
scourge of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would also finance the military's peacekeeping
mission in Kosovo, provide disaster relief to flood and wildfire
victims in the United States and make a down payment on a new
Second Avenue subway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republican leaders had bickered for months over
how to package the aid. The House passed a similar $12.7 billion
omnibus bill in late March, but Sen. Trent Lott, the majority
leader, balked at bundling such a wide range of aid, fearing that
it would be a magnet for pork-barrel spending.
</P>
<P>
   As the months dragged on with no action, the Pentagon warned
that without prompt financing, the armed services would have to
begin canceling training exercises. President Andres Pastrana of
Colombia cautioned that the delay was hurting his country's
antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators finally worked out a compromise
this week on the size and scope of the package and tacked it on to
a popular spending bill for military construction projects. The
final vote was 306-110, with 171 Republicans and 135 Democrats in
favor, and 44 Republicans, 64 Democrats and two independents
against.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans had also hoped to attach an amendment to
permit the limited sale of food and medicine to Cuba. But the
language agreed upon by House Republicans drew a filibuster threat
from Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who said the legislation would
do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuba amendment would bar public and private American
financing for the sale of food and medicine, and it would turn into
law current regulations that restrict which groups _ including
relatives and educators _ can visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so wrong, so outrageous,'' said Dodd, who supports
lifting sanctions altogether. ``Only poor and innocent people
suffer when you bar food and medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Cuba leaves the amendment's future uncertain.
House Republicans said they now hoped to attach it to an
agriculture spending bill after the holiday recess, but if
Democratic objections persist, the deal could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package also includes $2 billion to pay for costs the
Pentagon has incurred this year as part of the NATO mission in
Kosovo. The bill provides the military with $1.6 billion to cover
rising fuel costs and $1.3 billion to supplement its health care
program.
</P>
<P>
   Aid was not confined to foreign emergencies. The package has
$661 million to pay reconstruction costs for the 400 families in
Los Alamos, N.M., who lost their homes after the devastating fire
there two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also tucked in were odds and ends, like $17.5 million to improve
fire safety in the Capitol, $4.5 million to reimburse the District
of Columbia Police Department for costs related to protests at
recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund, and $3 million
toward a new Second Avenue subway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But easily the most contentious part of the package focused on
the antinarcotics aid to Colombia and other countries in the
region, including Ecuador and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   This assistance would lead to a much larger American role in
helping Colombia crack down on a flourishing narcotics trade in
rebel-controlled territory in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes 18 Blackhawk helicopters and 42 Huey II
helicopters, which are needed to ferry special Colombian army
battalions and Colombian National Police. The mix of aircraft
represents a compromise between the House, which favored the
larger, more expensive Blackhawks, and the Senate, which wanted
only the less costly Hueys.
</P>
<P>
   To help address the critics' concerns about the Colombian
military's poor human rights record, the bill includes $122 million
for programs to promote human rights and justice in the region, $29
million more than the administration had requested.
</P>
<P>
   With fears of an open-ended military commitment hanging heavy
over many members, the bill has a provision that limits the number
of American military personnel in support of the Colombia mission
to 500 at any one time, unless more are needed for a rescue
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying we want to help, but only if you assure us you do
not abuse human rights, and prosecute any violators who do,'' said
Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., who lived in Colombia for two years as a
Peace Corps volunteer. ``If you are using this aid to help the
insurgents, you lose the helicopters.''
</P>
<P>
   The American aid is going to support an antidrug plan that
Pastrana announced last year, after working closely with
U.S.officials. The strategy, called Plan Colombia, seeks $3.5
billion in international aid in the next three years. Beside the
enforcement components, the plan envisions public investment to
stimulate Colombia's beleaguered economy.

`BULLWINKLE': A NOISY, BLOATED MESS WITH LAME ATTEMPTS AT SATIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the old ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cartoons? If you do,
either from their initial run in the early 1960s or their long
afterlife in syndication, you will recall that they were short,
clever (albeit in a stupid kind of way) and proudly
two-dimensional. The drawing and animation were defiantly crude,
cheap and fast. The show's low-rent look was as integral to its
aesthetic as the narrator's goofy modernist intrusions or the
moose's barrage of bad puns and loopy malapropisms.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone want to spin this slight, charming relic of the
pop culture past into a high-tech, expensive, effect-jammed feature
film like ``The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle''? As if
anxiously aware of its own pointlessness, Des McAnuff's hectic
blend of computer animation and live action raises this question
obsessively, hoping to distract a credulous audience with knowing
showbiz parody.
</P>
<P>
   The gambit works for about 10 minutes, an all-cartoon segment
during which the biographies of Rocky, Bullwinkle and their nemeses
over in Pottsylvania, whose escapades were unceremoniously canceled
in 1964, are rapidly brought up to date. The squirrel and the moose
live in the now deforested town of Frostbite Falls, Minn.,
supporting themselves with ever-shrinking residual checks, while
Boris, Natasha and their Fearless Leader are stymied by the fall of
the Iron Curtain, which falls, with appropriate sound effects, on
them. The narrator has moved back in with his mother and has been,
as he puts it ``reduced to narrating events in his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, but then the movie succumbs to its blockbuster
ambitions and turns into a noisy, bloated mess. Bloating, in fact,
is literally what happens to our heroes, who morph from line
drawings into computer-generated 3-D projections that look like
half-inflated floats from the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. Boris
and Natasha have slightly better luck: They turn into Jason
Alexander and Rene Russo, who do some spirited hamming on the way
to cashing their checks, which will be co-signed by Robert De Niro,
who plays Fearless Leader and whose company, TriBeCa Films, was
among the producers of this film.
</P>
<P>
   His mouth fixed in a rictus of evil glee, Fearless Leader has
apparently borrowed not only Regis Philbin's wardrobe of matching
shiny shirt-and-tie combos, but also Philbin's ambition to dominate
the airwaves. Fearless Leader concocts an elaborate plan to stupefy
the American public by making television even dumber than it
already is. The flagship of this scheme is RBTV _ Really Bad TV _
with headquarters in a New York skyscraper that looks a lot like
Rockefeller Center, home of the real-world NBC, the original Rocky
and Bullwinkle show's network.
</P>
<P>
   This is typical of the movie's lame, confused attempts at
satire, as is the movie studio called Phony Pictures. ``The
Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle'' cloaks its essential inanity
in warmed-over sub-``Simpsons'' facetiousness. The irreverent,
off-the-cuff spirit of Jay Ward's freewheeling original doesn't
really make it to the big screen. What should seem plucky,
inventive and charmingly silly _ improbable coincidences, elaborate
setups for trifling jokes _ feels at once panicky and stale.
</P>
<P>
   The script, by the playwright Kenneth Lonergan, desperately
tries to poke fun at its own ambitions, to signal to the audience
that there's nothing here to take seriously, but this feels like
cheating. When Fearless Leader proclaims that real and animated
characters have never before shared the screen, another says,
``What about that movie `Roger Rabbit'?'' ``This is completely
different,'' thunders the would-be ruler of the world, and you
can't help agreeing. That 1988 Robert Zemeckis extravaganza was a
good movie.
</P>
<P>
   The show biz references _ creaky plays on industry terms like
green lighting and hiatus _ will sail over the heads of most
children, as will De Niro's reprise of Travis Bickle's most famous
scene in ``Taxi Driver.'' But then again, ``The Adventures of Rocky
and Bullwinkle'' isn't really aimed at today's children. It's
another attempt to cash in on baby boomer nostalgia, and to exploit
that generation's bottomless appetite for nostalgic self-regard.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the self-congratulatory cameos by John
Goodman, Billy Crystal, Jonathan Winters (in multiple roles) and
Whoopi Goldberg, whose character is named Judge Cameo? Why else
would the filmmakers tack on a syrupy moral about self-knowledge
and the inner child?
</P>
<P>
   It's uttered, with abashed conviction, by the hard-working Piper
Perabo, who plays the youngest-looking FBI agent in film history.
The original ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' had sufficient ingenuity to
revel in its own dumbness and make an audience reared on Mad
magazine feel smart. Their new ``Adventures'' are made by people
who clearly think themselves much smarter than their audience. In
place of whimsy, it offers cynicism.

   PEROT MAY FACE OFF WITH BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   If Ross Perot wants to run for president again, now he can. An
effort to collect the required number of signatures to qualify him
for the Reform Party primary has succeeded, said Ira Goodman, a
party official from New Jersey who has been leading a campaign to
draft Perot as an alternative to the two other candidates who are
seeking the party nomination _ Pat Buchanan, the former television
commentator, and John Hagelin, a physicist.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, the Reform Party founder and two-time presidential
nominee, now has until Saturday to notify party officials by letter
that he intends to run, if that is his decision. Russell Verney,
one his close associates, said Thursday that he would speak to
Perot as soon as possible to review the options. Verney added that
a decision on whether to try to undercut the other two candidates,
especially Buchanan, whom many Reform Party members consider too
conservative, could come as early as Friday. The balloting for the
primary, which is conducted by mail and over the Internet, begins
on July 5 and ends Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNS ABOUT PROTESTS
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after voting to set aside Pershing Square in
downtown Los Angeles as a gathering place for protesters at the
Democratic National Convention, the Los Angeles City Council is
reconsidering the move under pressure from the police and
merchants' groups worried about violence or disruptions at
convention hotels and the jewelry mart near the square.
</P>
<P>
   The police have proposed putting demonstrators in a fenced-off
parking lot near the convention site. The council approved the new
plan as part of a $4 million bailout of the convention's local
organizing committee, at the insistence of one member, Jackie
Goldberg, a liberal Democrat representing Hollywood. The Secret
Service has now decided not to have Vice President Al Gore stay at
the Royal Biltmore Hotel, opposite the square, citing safety
concerns. After a sometimes impassioned debate on Wednesday, the
council referred the matter to a committee; a final vote is
expected next week.
</P>
<P>
   REALITY-BASED ADS FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is searching for real people _ or at least
actors who look like them. In a casting notice sent to talent
agents this week, a company representing the campaign said it was
looking for ``a wide range of assorted, real-looking people'' to
appear in spots for Gov. George W. Bush that are to be filmed in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the spot as a ``nonunion commercial,'' the memorandum
asked for ``everyday people on the street'' with a ``strong
emphasis on Hispanic and Caucasian.'' The notice was a surprise to
officials of the Screen Actors Guild, which is on strike against
the advertising industry. Guild officials said Thursday that they
thought they had a signed agreement that gave the Bush campaign
permission to hire union actors during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark McKinnon, Bush's media consultant, said that while two
members of the campaign's advertising team who are partners in a
separate agency had signed such an agreement, the Bush campaign's
own advertising agency, Maverick Media, had not.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S IN THE MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's ``progress and prosperity'' tour
carries an implicit argument for four more years of the current
administration, and at a campaign event in Chicago Thursday, the
recorded music made the same case. It was by Fleetwood Mac, the
band that played at President Clinton's inauguration festivities in
1993, and it even included the song ``Don't Stop (Thinking About
Tomorrow),'' Clinton's theme.
</P>
<P>
   The other tunes had their own strange relevance. There was ``The
Chain,'' a plea for continuity that includes a declaration _ ``if
you don't love me now, you will never love me again'' _ with
disturbing implications for a candidate trailing in many polls. And
there was ``Tusk,'' which seemed to capture the uncertainty of
Gore's future in Washington with its opening lines: ``Why don't you
ask him if he's going to stay? Why don't you ask him if he's going
away?''
</P>

SUPREME COURT REJECTS APPEAL BY MALE ATHLETES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Male collegiate athletes Thursday lost their
Supreme Court appeal of a university's decision to eliminate two
men's teams in an effort to balance athletic opportunities for male
and female students.
</P>
<P>
   The athletes had argued in vain that Illinois State University
violated the Constitution's ban on sex discrimination when school
officials canceled the wrestling and soccer programs.
</P>
<P>
   But a lower federal court accepted the university's counter
argument that cutting the men's teams was a valid effort by the
school to comply with a federal law prohibiting gender
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' refusal to hear the appeal sets no national
precedent regarding the legality of eliminating men's teams to
create equity between male and female athletic programs. Similar
lawsuits brought by other male college athletes are pending around
the country, potentially giving the high court an opportunity to
consider the issue fully in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose in 1995 when the Illinois school cut its men's
wrestling and soccer programs in an effort to comply with Title IX
of the federal 1972 Education Amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The law bans schools receiving federal funds from discriminating
on the basis of gender in their athletic and other programs.
Because virtually all schools receive some federal money, every
educational facility can potentially be held liable for providing
greater resources to men's athletic programs than to women's.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen wrestlers and soccer players challenged the
university's action as violating the Constitution's Equal
Protection Clause, which generally prohibits states and their
schools from intentionally discriminating on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the
university, saying its controversial action was legitimate in light
of Title IX and financial realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A holding that universities cannot achieve substantial
proportionality by cutting men's programs is tantamount to a
requirement that universities ... add women's sports programs,''
the 7th Circuit said. ``This result would ignore the financial and
budgetary constraints that universities face.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the men in their unsuccessful appeal was House
Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., a former high-school wrestling
coach in Illinois. He argued in a brief to the justices that Title
IX was intended to expand athletic programs for women, not
eliminate opportunities for male athletes.

OAS MISSION TO PERU SAYS INTELLIGENCE BOSS MUST GO
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The foreign minister of Canada and the secretary
general of the Organization of American States urged President
Alberto Fujimori on Thursday to remove his chief of intelligence as
a crucial step in re-establishing a full democracy after last
month's much criticized presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was one of several offered by the two officials,
including ensuring the independence of the judiciary, guaranteeing
access of the opposition to the media, establishing an independent
human rights commission and returning a television network to an
owner who was stripped of his property by the courts after critical
news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of Canada and Secretary General
Cesar Gaviria of the OAS came as heads of a three-day mission sent
here by the regional organization following two rounds of
presidential elections in April and May that were characterized by
dirty tricks during the campaign and a questionable count of
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials stopped short of satisfying the opposition's
demand for new elections, but its insistence that Fujimori limit
the powers of his intelligence services in the political process
created some friction in meetings with senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has to put a limit on what the intelligence
services can do,'' said Gaviria in an interview Thursday night,
``and put into better balance security and the rights of
individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior officials, who spoke on condition that they not be
identified, said the two officials pressed Fujimori to remove
Vladimiro Montesinos, his intelligence chief, from power as a
necessary step to improve Peru's international standing. They said
they had the explicit support of the Clinton administration in
making the proposal, but they added that it was too early to gauge
the Peruvian government's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos is believed to have been the mastermind of a smear
campaign of several presidential candidates in the tabloid press,
as well as a campaign of harassment of opposition candidates and
election observers. Though he was cashiered as an army officer for
alleged espionage in the 1970s, Montesinos has enormous influence
over the military. He handpicked top army commanders in the months
prior to the election and Fujimori recently said he retained close
communications with the CIA and Drug Enforcement Administration on
matters of security and the fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS mission told both the government and opposition that
they must enter a dialogue to rebuild the judiciary, Congress and
other democratic institutions. Alejandro Toledo, the opposition
presidential candidate who charged fraud and dropped out of the
race a week before the May 28 runoff, said he was ready to talk. A
presidential commission appointed by Fujimori put out a statement
Thursday saying, ``The government accepts discussion of these
themes with the political community and civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy responded with cautious optimism Thursday night to the
responses of both sides. ``It's not bad for the first day,'' he
said in an interview. ``It took God seven days to create the world
and we've been here only two.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said a permanent OAS mission would monitor and
facilitate talks between the government and opposition and attempt
to set timetables to guarantee results. One senior Canadian
official, for instance, said officials had a goal to overhaul the
government's election-counting apparatus by the 2002 municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Peruvian officials publicly rejected any timetables. ``We
are not going to establish a schedule, never,'' said Foreign
Minister Fernando de Trazegnies.
</P>
<P>
   There have been street demonstrations throughout the delegation
visit, several of which were broken up by police with tear gas.
Toledo led a march Wednesday night on the luxury hotel where the
delegation was staying. At least five people were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo urged the delegation to reject the legitimacy of the
presidential elections. ``I come to ask the OAS mission publicly,''
he told a rally, ``do not close your eyes to an illegitimate
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a business professor, plans to lead a large march late
next month with the goal of blocking Fujimori's July 28
inauguration to a third term.  &QL;

NADER CRITICIZES CLINTON-GORE ENERGY POLICIES
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate and Green Party
candidate for president, sharply criticized the Clinton-Gore
administration's energy policies Thursday, asserting that the
administration had set the stage for higher gasoline prices this
summer by allowing oil company mergers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing what has become one of the hottest issues in the
presidential race, Nader said the administration was doing ``too
little, too late'' about high gasoline prices by having the Federal
Trade Commission investigate possible price gouging by the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
   He said a much broader investigation by the Justice Department
and state attorney generals was warranted. He also called for
increasing the nation's oil reserves and taxing oil companies'
profits found to be excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They massage the public with rhetoric and they don't do
anything,'' Nader said of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who is expected to draw most of his support from among
Democrats, also ridiculed the energy proposals unveiled by Vice
President Al Gore this week. Gore, the likely Democratic nominee,
called for tax breaks and other financial incentives to encourage
people to buy, and companies to develop, fuel-efficient cars, solar
homes and other energy-saving products.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a breakfast with reporters, Nader called the
proposals rehashes of wrong-headed ideas. He asserted, for
instance, the administration's efforts to encourage Detroit to
build alternative-fuel cars had accomplished very little, at a cost
of $1 billion to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most one-sided deal ever in Washington
history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader went on to label Gore ``an environmental imposter'' and a
``gee-whiz techno twit'' who had all but abandoned poor and
working-class people in favor of corporate America, with its big
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his attacks on Gore, Nader argued that his candidacy
would be good for Democratic congressional candidates because he
would draw Democratic-leaning voters to the polls. And he took a
few shots at Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with George W. Bush is that he's beyond satire,''
Nader said. ``He's the corporate welfare king of all presidential
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he says to those who consider his positions extreme,
Nader replied that it was the corporate ``criminals'' and
``freeloaders'' who were the extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these positions that I foster are just normal,
old-fashioned positions,'' he said. A native of Connecticut, he
added, ``They are the kind of positions that people in New England
used to take as a matter of course.''

   SEATTLE -- Word around the league is that Mariners pitcher Jamie
Moyer is a bit kooky, and Angels right fielder Tim Salmon would
agree after what happened in Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning of a 2-1 game, Salmon was on first base as
the Angels had the bases loaded with one out and Garret Anderson
batting. Anderson kept fouling off pitches, five in all with two
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   While catcher Joe Oliver visited Moyer on the mound, Moyer,
exasperated, caught Salmon's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just got my attention, but I didn't know what he was
gesturing to,'' Salmon said. ``I said, `Are you talking to me? Who
are you talking to?' Griff (first base coach Alfredo Griffin) said
he's asking what pitch you think he should throw. He was just
making light of a pressure situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said he didn't offer a suggestion, and on the next pitch
Moyer struck out Anderson on a 75-mph changeup. Moyer than turned
toward Salmon and said, ``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In hindsight, I should have stuck one finger down for
fastball,'' Salmon said. ``He caught me off guard. ... My fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels won't play at Safeco Field again this season, and
Troy Glaus couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus had three hits in the Angels' first game at Safeco Field
this year, but in the past five, he's 1 for 19 with 15 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when guys get on a roll and have been so steady as
Troy's been, they tend to spoil you,'' manager Mike Scioscia said.
``They go good so long you expect it all the time. But it's not
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad had three more hits Thursday to increase his major
league-leading total to 126. At his current pace, Erstad will
finish the season with 261. The major league record is 257, held by
George Sisler of the St. Louis Browns and set in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad has five hitting streaks of at least seven games this
season. He has two or more hits in 40 games.

CONGRESS NEARS FUNDING AGREEMENT TO AVOID TEXAS DRUG PROSECUTION
BOYCOTT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of Congress .MDNM/were negotiating a $3 million deal
Thursday night with a group of Texas district attorneys along the
Mexican border in a bid to call off a threatened boycott of drug
smuggling cases, which had burdened county governments, an El Paso
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we worked it out in the last hour or so,'' El Paso
County District Attorney Jaime Esparza said by telephone from
Washington. ``I think it will cover everything. It's $3 million for
Texas. There are some details to be settled but I think it's going
to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas counties bordering Mexico have been swamped with federal
drug cases dumped by U.S. attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   District attorneys from five Texas border counties _ Cameron, El
Paso, Hidalgo, Hudspeth and Starr _ threatened to stop accepting
``small'' drug cases _ usually marijuana busts of less than 200
pounds that federal courts wouldn't touch.
</P>
<P>
   The deal pins $12 million in emergency appropriations to a
military construction bill approved by the House last night. The
four states along the Mexican border would each receive $3 million
to underwrite costs arising from jailing and trying drug suspects
over the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors called it a Band-Aid approach that would do
little to solve the long-term problem.
</P>
<P>
   But Esparza defended the last-minute deal and predicted a
permanent fix is down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have agreed to continue taking the cases if we
thought it was just for 90 days,'' Esparza said. ``Frankly, the
federal government isn't holding many cards in this dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides declined to speak publicly before a news
conference Friday morning, where Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas, was expected to formally announce the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before Esparza disclosed a deal had been struck, Hutchison
issued a prepared statement, saying: ``I made it my highest
priority so we do not have any kind of hiatus in the prosecution of
accused drug dealers.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the border, district attorneys have complained that the
heightened activity against drug smuggling by the federal
government was not matched with more prosecutors and more courts.
Federal courts only took major cases, leaving the rest to state
district courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increased manpower at the border with new federal agents
has not been well thought out,'' Hidalgo County District Attorney
Rene Guerra said by telephone from Edinburg, Texas. ``I'm not
criticizing, but it's a fact that what gets the political bite is
law enforcement rather than judges and prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors were trying to determine just what the $3
million for Texas would buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have reservations about how the funds will be administered
and what kinds of expenses would be covered under this program,''
said Cameron County (Brownsville) District Attorney Yolanda DeLeon.
``But I think we would be willing to do this as a short-term,
good-faith step to give members of Congress a little more room to
work out a long-term solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. attorneys were still making contingency plans in
case the funding doesn't pass or the district attorneys impose the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Blagg, U.S. attorney for the San Antonio-based federal
Western District, which covers the border from Del Rio to El Paso,
was preparing for his staff to take over the cases as it has had to
do in Webb County (Laredo) since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Webb County District Attorney Joe Rubio
launched the campaign for more national support by refusing to
accept federal drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors complain that cases with as many as a half-ton
of marijuana were being sent to state courts. Heriberto Silva, the
district attorney for Starr, Jim Hogg and Duval counties south of
San Antonio, said federal officials also were ignoring related
costs borne by the counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person is arrested right now and he's a federal prisoner,
the federal government pays for all of his costs,'' Silva said.
``But if I accept the case, the federal government feels they have
no further responsibility. All we get is a thank you. We pay for
him, we feed him, we get nothing from the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blagg said federal officials are worried about the
precedent-setting nature of giving money to border counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sympathetic to them, they've been fighting this battle for
the last three years, but it is still a hard sell,'' the U.S.
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do this, every DA in the country could hypothetically
make the same case,'' he warned. ``They could say the drugs didn't
originate in their county, that they were brought in from outside
of the country and they are just as deserving of funding for these
drug cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silva said all parts of the United States should support the
border prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop the drugs here, then they won't have to worry
about it,'' Silva said. ``That should be in everyone's interest. If
they think they've got the same problems we do, they come down to
the border and a take a look.'' &QL;

PRICELINE SHARES FALL AS AIRLINES PLAN TO INVEST IN A RIVAL WEB
SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in Priceline.com dropped 8.4 percent Thursday after a
report that six major airlines planned to invest in a competing Web
site for customers looking for discounts on plane tickets online.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that UAL's United
Airlines, AMR's American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Continental
Airlines, US Airways and America West Airlines had invested in
Hotwire.com, a San Francisco start-up scheduled to begin operating
this fall. Hotwire has $75 million in financing, primarily from the
Texas Pacific Group, a private investment firm that has owned
stakes in Continental and America West.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline shares closed at $36.8125 each, down $3.375, in Nasdaq
trading. The stock is down 69 percent from its 52-week high of
$119.
</P>
<P>
   Isakowitz Tomas, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, cut
the stock from a ``buy'' recommendation to ``accumulate,'' citing
continuing concern about the valuation as well as the impending
competition from Hotwire. Other analysts said the market had
overreacted. Eighteen of the 19 analysts following the stock still
rate it either a ``buy'' or ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors still haven't learned that just having some cash,
some partners and a press release does not make a leader,'' said
Lauren Levitan, an analyst with Robertson Stephens. ``What makes a
leader is getting out there and executing on a business plan day
after day. Priceline is two years old, on the verge of break-even
or profitability, and we do have ample evidence of their
executional capability.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Priceline, Hotwire will sell so-called distressed
inventory, seats that would otherwise go empty and that are not
published on industry-wide sites like Travelocity.com and
Expedia.com. Unlike Priceline, which requires users to bid for
seats and accept the lowest fare offered, Hotwire will let them
select an actual fare for the desired route. As with Priceline, the
identity of the carrier, and the precise timing and routing,
whether nonstop, or connecting, will be concealed until purchase.
</P>
<P>
   One big risk for Hotwire is that if it makes the process too
easy, it could undercut the airlines' sales of full-fare tickets to
business travelers, which are the source of most of their profits.
Because Priceline makes the consumer go through various hurdles to
get a discounted seat, it has reduced that risk for the carriers.
Although only Delta Air Lines was on board when Priceline began,
United, American and US Airways all joined in December and have
minority equity stakes in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have already banded together in a fare site for
leisure travelers, Orbitz.com, which is also scheduled to begin
this fall. Delta, United, Northwest, Continental and American will
take part in Orbitz, which is expected to offer fares similar to
the deep discount tickets available on the airlines' own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline said it expected no negative impact from Hotwire, and
noted that its airline service had grown sharply in recent weeks.
All eight major full-service U.S. airlines now work with Priceline,
as well as over 20 brand-name international carriers. Priceline now
sells more than 80,000 tickets a week. &QL;

EXCERPTS FROM SUPREME COURT OPINIONS ON NEBRASKA'S ABORTION LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS NOTE: On Wednesday, The New York Times News Service
transmitted excerpts from the majority opinion of the Supreme Court
decision striking down the Nebraska law on abortion, and excerpts
from one dissenting opinion. But six other justices also wrote
opinions. To provide a fuller account of the range of views on the
court in this case, additional excerpts appear below.)  
 (editors: please replace double parentheses (( )) with single
brackets)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from a Supreme Court
decision issued Wednesday overturning a Nebraska law dealing with
abortion. The vote in the case, Stenberg vs. Carhart, was 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Breyer
</P>
<P>
   We again consider the right to an abortion. We understand the
controversial nature of the problem. Millions of Americans believe
that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is
akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the
thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a
law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to
lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and
leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions
with the attendant risks of death and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Taking account of these virtually irreconcilable points of view,
aware that constitutional law must govern a society whose different
members sincerely hold directly opposing views, and considering the
matter in light of the Constitution's guarantees of fundamental
individual liberty, this court, in the course of a generation, has
determined and then redetermined that the Constitution offers basic
protection to the woman's right to choose. We shall not revisit
those legal principles. Rather, we apply them to the circumstances
of this case.
</P>
<P>
   Three established principles determine the issue before us. We
shall set them forth in the language of the joint opinion in
``Casey.''
</P>
<P>
   First, before ``viability the woman has a right to choose to
terminate her pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, ``a law designed to further the state's interest in
fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision
before fetal viability'' is unconstitutional. An ``undue burden is
shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the
purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of
a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.''
</P>
<P>
   Third, ``subsequent to viability, the state in promoting its
interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses,
regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is
necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of
the life or health of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   We apply these principles to a Nebraska law banning ``partial
birth abortion.'' The statute reads as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``No partial birth abortion shall be performed in this state,
unless such procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother
whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness,
or physical injury, including a life-endangering physical condition
caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The statute defines ``partial birth abortion'' as: ``an abortion
procedure in which the person performing the abortion partially
delivers vaginally a living unborn child before killing the unborn
child and completing the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   It further defines ``partially delivers vaginally a living
unborn child before killing the unborn child'' to mean:
``deliberately and intentionally delivering into the vagina a
living unborn child, or a substantial portion thereof, for the
purpose of performing a procedure that the person performing such
procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does kill the unborn
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The law classifies violation of the statute as a ``Class III
felony'' carrying a prison term of up to 20 years, and a fine of up
to $25,000. It also provides for the automatic revocation of a
doctor's license to practice medicine in Nebraska. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The question before us is whether Nebraska's statute, making
criminal the performance of a ``partial birth abortion,'' violates
the federal Constitution, as interpreted in Planned Parenthood of
Southeastern Pa. vs. Casey (1992) and Roe vs. Wade (1973). We
conclude that it does for at least two independent reasons. First,
the law lacks any exception ``for the preservation of the health of
the mother.'' Second, it ``imposes an undue burden on a woman's
ability'' to choose a D&AMP;E abortion, thereby unduly burdening the
right to choose abortion itself. We shall discuss each of these
reasons in turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Casey joint opinion reiterated what the Court held in Roe;
that ``subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest
in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and
even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in
appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or
health of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Nebraska's law applies both pre- and postviability
aggravates the constitutional problem presented. The state's
interest in regulating abortion previability is considerably weaker
than postviability. Since the law requires a health exception in
order to validate even a postviability abortion regulation, it at a
minimum requires the same in respect to previability regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The quoted standard also depends on the state regulations
``promoting ((the state's)) interest in the potentiality of human
life.'' The Nebraska law, of course, does not directly further an
interest ``in the potentiality of human life'' by saving the fetus
in question from destruction, as it regulates only a  &UR; method &LR;  of
performing abortion. Nebraska describes its interests differently.
It says the law ``shows concern for the life of the unborn,''
``prevents cruelty to partially born children,'' and ``preserves
the integrity of the medical profession.'' But we cannot see how
the interest-related differences could make any difference to the
question at hand, namely, the application of the ``health''
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the governing standard requires an exception
``where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment for the
preservation of the life or health of the mother,'' for this court
has made clear that a state may promote but not endanger a woman's
health when it regulates the methods of abortion: Thornburgh vs.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Colautti vs.
Franklin, Danforth, Doe vs. Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Thomas says that the cases just cited limit this
principle to situations where the pregnancy  &UR; itself &LR;  creates a
threat to health. He is wrong. The cited cases, reaffirmed in
Casey, recognize that a state cannot subject women's health to
significant risks both in that context,  &UR; and also &LR;  where state
regulations force women to use riskier methods of abortion. Our
cases have repeatedly invalidated statutes that in the process of
regulating the  &UR; methods &LR;  of abortion, imposed significant health
risks. They make clear that a risk to a women's health is the same
whether it happens to arise from regulating a particular method of
abortion, or from barring abortion entirely. Our holding does not
go beyond those cases, as ratified in Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska responds that the law does not require a health
exception unless there is a need for such an exception. And here
there is no such need, it says. It argues that ``safe alternatives
remain available'' and ``a ban on partial-birth abortion/D&AMP;X would
create no risk to the health of women.'' The problem for Nebraska
is that the parties strongly contested this factual question in the
trial court below; and the findings and evidence support Dr.
Carhart. The state fails to demonstrate that banning D&AMP;X without a
health exception may not create significant health risks for women,
because the record shows that significant medical authority
supports the proposition that in some circumstances, D&AMP;X would be
the safest procedure.
</P>
<P>
   We shall reiterate in summary form the relevant findings and
evidence. On the basis of medical testimony the District Court
concluded that Carhart's D&AMP;X procedure is . . . safer than the D&AMP;E
and other abortion procedures used during the relevant gestational
period in the 10 to 20 cases a year that present to Dr. Carhart. It
found that the D&AMP;X procedure permits the fetus to pass through the
cervix with a minimum of instrumentation. It thereby reduces
operating time, blood loss and risk of infection; reduces
complications from bony fragments; reduces instrument-inflicted
damage to the uterus and cervix; prevents the most common causes of
maternal mortality (DIC and amniotic fluid embolus); and eliminates
the possibility of `horrible complications' arising from retained
fetal parts.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska, along with supporting amici, replies that these
findings are irrelevant, wrong, or applicable only in a tiny number
of instances. It says (1) that the D&AMP;X procedure is little-used,
(2) by only a handful of doctors. It argues (3) that D&AMP;E and labor
induction are at all times safe alternative procedures. It refers
to the testimony of petitioners medical expert, who testified (4)
that the ban would not increase a woman's risk of several rare
abortion complications (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and
amniotic fluid embolus).
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons et al.,
amici supporting Nebraska, argue (5) that elements of the D&AMP;X
procedure may create special risks, including cervical incompetence
caused by overdilitation, injury caused by conversion of the fetal
presentation, and dangers arising from the blind use of
instrumentation to pierce the fetal skull while lodged in the birth
canal. Nebraska further emphasizes (6) that there are no medical
studies ``establishing the safety of the partial-birth abortion/D&AMP;X
procedure,'' and ``no medical studies comparing the safety of
partial-birth abortion/D&AMP;X to other abortion procedures. It points
to (7) an American Medical Association policy statement that there
does not appear to be any identified situation in which intact D&AMP;X
is the only appropriate procedure to induce abortion. And it points
out (8) that the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists qualified its statement that D&AMP;X ``may be the best or
most appropriate procedure,'' by adding that the panel ``could
identify no circumstances under which the ((D&AMP;X)) procedure would
be the only option to save the life or preserve the health of the
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   We find these eight arguments insufficient to demonstrate that
Nebraska's law needs no health exception. For one thing, certain of
the arguments are beside the point. The D&AMP;X procedure's relative
rarity (argument 1) is not highly relevant. The D&AMP;X is an
infrequently used abortion procedure; but the health exception
question is whether protecting women's health requires an exception
for those infrequent occasions. A rarely used treatment might be
necessary to treat a rarely occurring disease that could strike
anyone; the state cannot prohibit a person from obtaining treatment
simply by pointing out that most people do not need it. Nor can we
know whether the fact that only a handful of doctors use the
procedure (argument 2) reflects the comparative rarity of late
second term abortions, the procedure's recent development, the
controversy surrounding it, or, as Nebraska suggests, the
procedure's lack of utility.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, the record responds to Nebraska's (and
amici's) medically based arguments. In respect to argument 3, for
example, the District Court agreed that alternatives, such as D&AMP;E
and induced labor, are safe but found that the D&AMP;X method was
significantly safer in certain circumstances. In respect to
argument 4, the District Court simply relied on different expert
testimony stating that another advantage of the Intact D&AMP;E is that
it eliminates the risk of embolism of cerebral tissue into the
woman's blood stream.
</P>
<P>
   In response to amici's argument (5), the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in its own amici brief, denies
that D&AMP;X generally poses risks greater than the alternatives. It
says that the suggested alternative procedures involve similar or
greater risks of cervical and uterine injury, for D&AMP;E procedures,
involve similar amounts of dilitation and of course childbirth
involves even greater cervical dilitation. The College points out
that Dr. Carhart does not reposition the fetus, thereby avoiding
any risks stemming from conversion to breech presentation, and
that, as compared with D&AMP;X, D&AMP;E involves the same, if not greater,
blind use of sharp instruments in the uterine cavity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We do not quarrel with Nebraska's argument (6), for Nebraska is
right. There are no general medical studies documenting comparative
safety. Neither do we deny the import of the American Medical
Associations statement (argument 7) even though the state does omit
the remainder of that statement: The A.M.A. recommends that the
procedure not be used unless alternative procedures pose materially
greater risk to the woman.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot, however, read the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists panel's qualification (that it could not identify
a circumstance where D&AMP;X was the only life- or health-preserving
option) as if, according to Nebraska's argument, (8) it denied the
potential health-related need for D&AMP;X. That is because the College
writes the following in its amici brief:
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the physician's skill and experience, the D&AMP;X
procedure can be the most appropriate abortion procedure for some
women in some circumstances. D&AMP;X presents a variety of potential
safety advantages over other abortion procedures used during the
same gestational period. Compared to D&AMP;E's involving dismemberment,
D&AMP;X involves less risk of uterine perforation or cervical
laceration because it requires the physician to make fewer passes
into the uterus with sharp instruments and reduces the presence of
sharp fetal bone fragments that can injure the uterus and cervix.''
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Using this law, some present prosecutors and future attorneys
general may choose to pursue physicians who use D&AMP;E procedures, the
most commonly used method for performing previability second
trimester abortions. All those who perform abortion procedures
using that method must fear prosecution, conviction and
imprisonment. The result is an undue burden upon a woman's right to
make an abortion decision. We must consequently find the statute
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   JUSTICE O'CONNOR,
</P>
<P>
   Concurring
</P>
<P>
   The issue of abortion is one of the most contentious and
controversial in contemporary American society. It presents
extraordinarily difficult questions that, as the Court recognizes,
involve ``virtually irreconcilable points of view.'' The specific
question we face today is whether Nebraska's attempt to proscribe a
particular method of abortion, commonly known as ``partial-birth
abortion,'' is constitutional. For the reasons stated in the
Court's opinion, I agree that Nebraska's statute cannot be
reconciled with our decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pa. vs. Casey, and is therefore unconstitutional. I write
separately to emphasize the following points.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Nebraska statute is inconsistent with Casey because
it lacks an exception for those instances when the banned procedure
is necessary to preserve the health of the mother. Importantly,
Nebraska's own statutory scheme underscores this constitutional
infirmity. As we held in Casey, prior to viability ``the woman has
a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.'' After the fetus has
become viable, states may substantially regulate and even proscribe
abortion, but any such regulation or proscription must contain an
exception for instances ``where it is necessary, in appropriate
medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the
mother.'' Nebraska has recognized this constitutional limitation in
its separate statute generally proscribing postviability abortions.
That statute provides that ``no abortion shall be performed after
the time at which, in the sound medical judgment of the attending
physician, the unborn child clearly appears to have reached
viability,  &UR; except when necessary to preserve the life or health of
the mother &LR; .'' Because even a postviability proscription of
abortion would be invalid absent a health exception, Nebraska's ban
on previability partial-birth abortions, under the circumstances
presented here, must include a health exception as well, since the
state's interest in regulating abortions before viability is
``considerably weaker'' than after viability. The statute at issue
here, however, only excepts those procedures ``necessary to save
the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a physical
disorder, physical illness, or physical injury.'' This lack of a
health exception necessarily renders the statute unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the assertions of Justice Kennedy and Justice
Thomas, the need for a health exception does not arise from ``the
individual views of Dr. Carhart and his supporters.'' Rather, as
the majority explains, where, as here, ``a significant body of
medical opinion believes a procedure may bring with it greater
safety for some patients and explains the medical reasons
supporting that view,'' then Nebraska cannot say that the procedure
will not, in some circumstances, be ``necessary to preserve the
life or health of the mother.'' Accordingly, our precedent requires
that the statute include a health exception.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Nebraska's statute is unconstitutional on the
alternative and independent ground that it imposes an undue burden
on a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy before
viability. Nebraska's ban covers not just the dilation and
extraction (D&AMP;X) procedure, but also the dilation an evacuation
(D&AMP;E) procedure, ``the most commonly used method for performing
previability second trimester abortions.'' The statute defines the
banned procedure as ``deliberately and intentionally delivering
into the vagina a living unborn child,  &UR; or a substantial portion
thereof &LR; , for the purpose of performing a procedure that the person
performing such procedure knows will kill the unborn child and does
kill the unborn child.'' As the Court explains, the medical
evidence establishes that the D&AMP;E procedure is included in this
definition. Thus, it is not possible to interpret the statute's
language as applying only to the D&AMP;X procedure. We have stated on
several occasions that we ordinarily defer to the construction of a
state statute given it by the lower federal courts unless such a
construction amounts to plain error. Such deference is not unique
to the abortion context, but applies generally to state statutes
addressing all areas of the law. Given this construction, the
statute is impermissible. Indeed, Nebraska conceded at oral
argument that ``the State could not prohibit the D&AMP;E procedure.''
By proscribing the most commonly used method for previability
second trimester abortions, the statute creates a ``substantial
obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion,'' and therefore imposes an
undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy prior to
viability.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is important to note that, unlike Nebraska, some other States
have enacted statutes more narrowly tailored to proscribing the D&AMP;X
procedure alone. Some of those statutes have done so by
specifically excluding from their coverage the most common methods
of abortion, such as the D&AMP;E and vacuum aspiration procedures. For
example, the Kansas statute states that its ban does not apply to
the ``(A) suction curettage abortion procedure; (B) suction
aspiration abortion procedure; or (C) dilation and evacuation
abortion procedure involving dismemberment of the fetus prior to
removal from the body of the pregnant woman. The Utah statute
similarly provides that its prohibition ``does not include the
dilation and evacuation procedure involving dismemberment prior to
removal, the suction curettage procedure, or the suction aspiration
procedure for abortion.'' Likewise, the Montana statute defines the
banned procedure as one in which ``(A) the living fetus is removed
intact from the uterus until only the head remains in the uterus;
(B) all or a part of the intracranial contents of the fetus are
evacuated; (C) the head of the fetus is compressed; and (D)
following fetal demise, the fetus is removed from the birth
canal.'' By restricting their prohibitions to the D&AMP;X procedure
exclusively, the Kansas, Utah, and Montana statutes avoid a
principal defect of the Nebraska law.
</P>
<P>
   If Nebraska's statute limited its application to the D&AMP;X
procedure and included an exception for the life and health of the
mother, the question presented would be quite different than the
one we face today. As we held in Casey, an abortion regulation
constitutes an undue burden if it ``has the purpose or effect of
placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an
abortion of a nonviable fetus.'' If there were adequate alternative
methods for a woman safely to obtain an abortion before viability,
it is unlikely that prohibiting the D&AMP;X procedure alone would
``amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman
seeking an abortion.'' Thus, a ban on partial-birth abortion that
only proscribed the D s statute, however, does not meet these
criteria. It contains no exception for when the procedure, in
appropriate medical judgment, is necessary to preserve the health
of the mother; and it proscribes not only the D&AMP;X method of
abortion and that included an exception to preserve the life and
health of the mother would be constitutional in my view.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's statute, however, does not meet these criteria. It
contains no exception for when the procedure, in appropriate
medical judgment, is necessary to preserve the health of the
mother; and it proscribes not only the D&AMP;X procedure but also the
D&AMP;E procedure, the most commonly used method for previability
second trimester abortions, thus making it an undue burden on a
woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. For these reasons, I
agree with the Court that Nebraska's law is unconstitutional.

   JUSTICE STEVENS,

<P>
   CONCURRING,
</P>
<P>
   With Justice Ginsburg  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although much ink is spilled today describing the gruesome
nature of late-term abortion procedures, that rhetoric does not
provide me a  &UR; reason &LR;  to believe that the procedure Nebraska here
claims it seeks to ban is more brutal, more gruesome, or less
respectful of ``potential life'' than the equally gruesome
procedure Nebraska claims it still allows. Justice Ginsburg and
Judge Posner have, I believe, correctly diagnosed the underlying
reason for the enactment of this legislation a reason that also
explains much of the Court's rhetoric directed at an objective that
extends well beyond the narrow issue that this case presents. The
rhetoric is almost, but not quite, loud enough to obscure the quiet
fact that during the past 27 years, the central holding of Roe vs.
Wade, has been endorsed by all but 4 of the 17 Justices who have
addressed the issue. That holding that the word ``liberty'' in the
Fourteenth Amendment includes a woman's right to make this
difficult and extremely personal decision makes it impossible for
me to understand how a state has any legitimate interest in
requiring a doctor to follow any procedure other than the one that
he or she reasonably believes will best protect the woman in her
exercise of this constitutional liberty. But one need not even
approach this view today to conclude that Nebraska's law must fall.
For the notion that either of these two equally gruesome procedures
performed at this late stage of gestation is more akin to
infanticide than the other, or that the State furthers any
legitimate interest by banning one but not the other, is simply
irrational.

   FROM A DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Thomas
</P>
<P>
   With Justice Scalia
</P>
<P>
   And Chief Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, this court struck down an act of the Texas Legislature
that had been in effect since 1857, thereby rendering
unconstitutional abortion statutes in dozens of states. As some of
my colleagues on the court, past and present, ably demonstrated,
that decision was grievously wrong . . .
</P>
<P>
   Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of control
over her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life or
potential human life. Nothing in our federal Constitution deprives
the people of this country of the right to determine whether the
consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the
burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother. Although a state
 &UR; may &LR;  permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a
state  &UR; must &LR;  do so. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the years following Roe, this court applied, and, worse,
extended, that decision to strike down numerous state statutes that
purportedly threatened a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. The
court voided parental consent laws, legislation requiring that
second-trimester abortions take place in hospitals, and even a
requirement that both parents of a minor be notified before their
child has an abortion. It was only a slight exaggeration when this
court described, in 1976, a right to abortion ``without
interference from the state.'' The court's expansive application of
Roe in this period, even more than Roe itself, was fairly described
as the ``unrestrained imposition of ((the court's)) own,
extraconstitutional value preferences'' on the American people.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that this era of Court-mandated abortion on demand
had come to an end, first with our decision in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, and then finally (or so we were told)
in our decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. vs.
Casey. Although in Casey the separate opinions of the chief justice
and Justice Scalia urging the court to overrule Roe did not command
a majority, seven members of that court, including six members
sitting today, acknowledged that states have a legitimate role in
regulating abortion and recognized the states' interest in
respecting fetal life at all stages of development. The joint
opinion authored by Justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter concluded
that prior case law ``went too far'' in ``undervaluing the state's
interest in potential life'' and in ``striking down some abortion
regulations which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate
decision.'' Roe and subsequent cases, according to the joint
opinion, had wrongly ``treated all governmental attempts to
influence a woman's decision on behalf of the potential life within
her as unwarranted,'' a treatment that was ``incompatible with the
recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential
life throughout pregnancy.'' Accordingly, the joint opinion held
that so long as state regulation of abortion furthers legitimate
interests that is, interests not designed to strike at the right
itself the regulation is invalid only if it imposes an undue burden
on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion, meaning that it places
a  &UR; substantial obstacle &LR;  in the woman's path. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The standard set forth in the Casey joint opinion has no
historical or doctrinal pedigree. The standard is a product of its
authors' own philosophical views about abortion, and it should go
without saying that it has no origins in or relationship to the
Constitution and is, consequently, as illegitimate as the standard
it purported to replace. Even assuming, however, as I will for the
remainder of this dissent, that Casey's fabricated undue-burden
standard merits adherence (which it does not), today's decision is
extraordinary. Today, the court inexplicably holds that the states
cannot constitutionally prohibit a method of abortion that millions
find hard to distinguish from infanticide and that the court
hesitates even to describe. . . . In striking down this statute,
which expresses a profound and legitimate respect for fetal life
and which leaves unimpeded several other safe forms of abortion,
the majority opinion gives the lie to the promise of Casey that
regulations that do no more than ``express profound respect for the
life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial
obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose'' whether
or not to have an abortion. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the almost 30 years since Roe, this court has never described
the various methods of aborting a second- or third-trimester fetus.
From reading the majority's sanitized description, one would think
that this case involves state regulation of a widely accepted
routine medical procedure. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The most widely used method of abortion during this stage of
pregnancy is so gruesome that its use can be traumatic even for the
physicians and medical staff who perform it. And the particular
procedure at issue in this case, ``partial birth abortion,'' so
closely borders on infanticide that 30 states have attempted to ban
it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the State of Nebraska has a valid
interest, one not designed to strike at the right itself, in
prohibiting partial birth abortion. Casey itself noted that states
may ``express profound respect for the life of the unborn.'' States
may, without a doubt, express this profound respect by prohibiting
a procedure that approaches infanticide, and thereby dehumanizes
the fetus and trivializes human life. The A.M.A. has recognized
that this procedure is ``ethically different from other destructive
abortion techniques because the fetus, normally 20 weeks or longer
in gestation, is killed  &UR; outside &LR;  the womb.
</P>
<P>
   The ``partial birth'' gives the fetus an autonomy which
separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for
her own body. . . . The next question, therefore, is whether the
Nebraska statute is unconstitutional because it does not contain an
exception that would allow use of the procedure whenever
``necessary in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation
of the health of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   In Roe and Casey, the court stated that the state may
``regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is
necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of
the life or health of the mother.'' Casey said that a health
exception must be available if `` &UR; continuing her pregnancy &LR;  would
constitute a threat'' to the woman. Under these cases, if a state
seeks to prohibit abortion, even if only temporarily or under
particular circumstances, as Casey says that it may, the state must
make an exception for cases in which the life or health of the
mother is endangered by continuing the pregnancy. These cases
addressed only the situation in which a woman must obtain an
abortion because of some threat to her health from continued
pregnancy. But Roe and Casey say nothing at all about cases in
which a physician considers one prohibited method of abortion to be
preferable to permissible methods. Today's majority and Justice
O'Connor twist Roe and Casey to apply to the situation in which a
woman desires for whatever reason an abortion and wishes to obtain
the abortion by some particular method.

   FROM A DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   With Chief Justice Rehnquist
</P>
<P>
   For close to two decades after Roe vs. Wade, the Court gave but
slight weight to the interests of the separate states when their
legislatures sought to address persisting concerns raised by the
existence of a woman's right to elect an abortion in defined
circumstances. When the Court reaffirmed the essential holding of
Roe, a central premise was that the States retain a critical and
legitimate role in legislating on the subject of abortion, as
limited by the woman's right the Court restated and again
guaranteed. The political processes of the state are not to be
foreclosed from enacting laws to promote the life of the unborn and
to ensure respect for all human life and its potential. The state's
constitutional authority is a vital means for citizens to address
these grave and serious issues, as they must if we are to progress
in knowledge and understanding and in the attainment of some degree
of consensus.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision today, in my submission, repudiates this
understanding by invalidating a statute advancing critical state
interests, even though the law denies no woman the right to choose
an abortion and places no undue burden upon the right. The
legislation is well within the state's competence to enact. Having
concluded Nebraska's law survives the scrutiny dictated by a proper
understanding of Casey, I dissent from the judgment invalidating
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Court's failure to accord any weight to Nebraska's interest
in prohibiting partial-birth abortion is erroneous and undermines
its discussion and holding. The Courts approach in this regard is
revealed by its description of the abortion methods at issue, which
the Court is correct to describe as clinically cold or callous. The
majority views the procedures from the perspective of the
abortionist, rather than from the perspective of a society shocked
when confronted with a new method of ending human life. Words
invoked by the majority, such as transcervical procedures, osmotic
dilators, instrumental disarticulation, and paracervical block, may
be accurate and are to some extent necessary, but for citizens who
seek to know why laws on this subject have been enacted across the
nation, the words are insufficient. Repeated references to sources
understandable only to a trained physician may obscure matters for
persons not trained in medical terminology. Thus it seems necessary
at the outset to set forth what may happen during an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The person challenging Nebraska's law is Dr. Leroy Carhart, a
physician. . . As described by Dr. Carhart, the D&AMP;E procedure
requires the abortionist to use instruments to grasp a portion
(such as a foot or hand) of a developed and living fetus and drag
the grasped portion out of the uterus into the vagina. Dr. Carhart
uses the traction created by the opening between the uterus and
vagina to dismember the fetus, tearing the grasped portion away
from the remainder of the body. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The other procedure implicated today is called partial-birth
abortion or the D&AMP;X. The D&AMP;X can be used, as a general matter,
after 19 weeks gestation because the fetus has become so developed
that it may survive intact partial delivery from the uterus into
the vagina. In the D&AMP;X, the abortionist initiates the woman's
natural delivery process by causing the cervix of the woman to be
dilated, sometimes over a sequence of days. The fetus arms and legs
are delivered outside the uterus while the fetus is alive;
witnesses to the procedure report seeing the body of the fetus
moving outside the woman's body. At this point, the abortion
procedure has the appearance of a live birth. As stated by one
group of physicians, as the physician manually performs breech
extraction of the body of a live fetus, excepting the head, she
continues in the apparent role of an obstetrician delivering a
child. With only the head of the fetus remaining in utero, the
abortionist tears open the skull. According to Dr. Martin Haskell,
a leading proponent of the procedure, the appropriate instrument to
be used at this stage of the abortion is a pair of scissors. . . .
Of the two described procedures, Nebraska seeks only to ban the
D&AMP;X. In light of the description of the D&AMP;X procedure, it should go
without saying that Nebraska's ban on partial-birth abortion
furthers purposes state's are entitled to pursue. Dr. Carhart
nevertheless maintains the State has no legitimate interest in
forbidding the D&AMP;X. As he interprets the controlling cases in this
court, the only two interests the State may advance through
regulation of abortion are in the health of the woman who is
considering the procedure and in the life of the fetus she carries.
The court, as I read its opinion, accedes to his views,
misunderstanding Casey and the authorities it confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Casey held that cases decided in the wake of Roe vs. Wade, had
given ((state interests)) too little acknowledgment and
implementation. The decision turned aside any contention that a
person has the right to decide whether to have an abortion without
interference from the state, and rejected a strict scrutiny
standard of review as incompatible with the recognition that there
is a substantial state interest in potential life throughout
pregnancy. The very notion that the State has a substantial
interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all
regulations must be deemed unwarranted. We held it was
inappropriate for the Judicial Branch to provide an exhaustive list
of state interests implicated by abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Casey is premised on the states having an important
constitutional role in defining their interests in the abortion
debate. It is only with this principle in mind that Nebraska's
interests can be given proper weight. The States brief describes
its interests as including concern for the life of the unborn and
for the partially-born, in preserving the integrity of the medical
profession, and in erecting a barrier to infanticide. A review of
Casey demonstrates the legitimacy of these policies. The court
should say so.
</P>
<P>
   States may take sides in the abortion debate and come down on
the side of life, even life in the unborn Even in the earliest
stages of pregnancy, the state may enact rules and regulations
designed to encourage ((a woman)) to know that there are
philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be
brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term
and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of
unwanted children as well as a certain degree of state assistance
if the mother chooses to raise the child herself. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Abortion, Casey held, has consequences beyond the woman and her
fetus. The States interests in regulating are of concomitant
extension. Casey recognized that abortion is, fraught with
consequences for the persons who perform and assist in the
procedure ((and for)) society which must confront the knowledge
that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of
an act of violence against innocent human life. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Casey demonstrates that the interests asserted by the State are
legitimate and recognized by law. It is argued, however, that a ban
on the D&AMP;X does not further these interests. This is because, the
reasoning continues, the D&AMP;E method, which Nebraska claims to be
beyond its intent to regulate, can still be used to abort a fetus
and is no less dehumanizing than the D&AMP;X method.
</P>
<P>
   While not adopting the argument in express terms, the court
indicates tacit approval of it by refusing to reject it in a
forthright manner. Rendering express what is only implicit in the
majority opinion, Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg are
forthright in declaring that the two procedures are
indistinguishable and that Nebraska has acted both irrationally and
without a proper purpose in enacting the law. The issue is not
whether members of the judiciary can see a difference between the
two procedures. It is whether Nebraska can. The court's refusal to
recognize Nebraska's right to declare a moral difference between
the procedure is a dispiriting disclosure of the illogic and
illegitimacy of the court's approach to the entire case.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska was entitled to find the existence of a consequential
moral difference between the procedures. We are referred to
substantial medical authority that D&AMP;X perverts the natural birth
process to a greater degree than D&AMP;E, commandeering the live birth
process until the skull is pierced. American Medical Association
(AMA) publications describe the D&AMP;X abortion method as ethically
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The D&AMP;X differs from the D&AMP;E because in the D&AMP;X the fetus is
killed outside of the womb where the fetus has an autonomy which
separates it from the right of the woman to choose treatments for
her own body. Witnesses to the procedure relate that the fingers
and feet of the fetus are moving prior to the piercing of the
skull; when the scissors are inserted in the back of the head, the
fetus body, wholly outside the woman's body and alive, reacts as
though startled and goes limp. D&AMP;X's stronger resemblance to
infanticide means Nebraska could conclude the procedure presents a
greater risk of disrespect for life and a consequent greater risk
to the profession and society, which depend for their sustenance
upon reciprocal recognition of dignity and respect. The court is
without authority to second-guess this conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   FROM A DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Scalia
</P>
<P>
   I am optimistic enough to believe that, one day, Stenberg vs.
Carhart will be assigned its rightful place in the history of this
Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. The method
of killing a human child _ one cannot even accurately say an
entirely unborn human child _ proscribed by this statute is so
horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder
of revulsion. And the Court must know (as most state legislatures
banning this procedure have concluded) that demanding a ``health
exception'' which requires the abortionist to assure himself that,
in his expert medical judgment, this method is, in the case at
hand, marginally safer than others (how can one prove the contrary
beyond a reasonable doubt?) is to give live-birth abortion free
rein. . . . The notion that the Constitution of the United States,
designed, among other things, ``to establish Justice, insure
domestic Tranquility, . . . and secure the Blessings of Liberty to
ourselves and our Posterity,'' prohibits the states from simply
banning this visibly brutal means of eliminating our half-born
posterity is quite simply absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The two lengthy dissents in this case have, appropriately
enough, set out to establish that today's result does not follow
from this Court's most recent pronouncement on the matter of
abortion, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. vs. Casey, It
would be unfortunate, however, if those who disagree with the
result were induced to regard it as merely a regrettable
misapplication of Casey. It is not that, but is Casey's logical and
entirely predictable consequence. To be sure, the court's
construction of this statute so as to make it include procedures
other than live-birth abortion involves not only a disregard of
fair meaning, but an abandonment of the principle that even
ambiguous statutes should be interpreted in such fashion as to
render them valid rather than void. Casey does not permit that
jurisprudential novelty which must be chalked up to the Court's
inclination to bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or
even to speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue. It is of a
piece, in other words, with Hill vs. Colorado, also decided today.
</P>
<P>
   But the Court gives a second and independent reason for
invalidating this humane (not to say anti-barbarian) law: That it
fails to allow an exception for the situation in which the
abortionist believes that this live-birth method of destroying the
child might be safer for the woman. (As pointed out by Justice
Thomas, and elaborated upon by Justice Kennedy, there is no good
reason to believe this is ever the case, but who knows? It sometime
 &UR; might &LR;  be.)
</P>
<P>
   I have joined Justice Thomas' dissent because I agree that
today's decision is an ``unprecedented expansion'' of our prior
cases, ``is not mandated'' by Casey's ``undue burden'' test, and
can even be called (though this pushes me to the limit of my
belief) ``obviously irreconcilable with Casey's explication of what
its undue-burden standard requires.'' But I never put much stock in
Casey's explication of the inexplicable. In the last analysis, my
judgment that Casey does not support today's tragic result can be
traced to the fact that what I consider to be an ``undue burden''
is different from what the majority considers to be an ``undue
burden,'' a conclusion that cannot be demonstrated true or false by
factual inquiry or legal reasoning. It is a value judgment,
dependent upon how much one respects (or believes society ought to
respect) the life of a partially delivered fetus, and how much one
respects (or believes society ought to respect) the freedom of the
woman who gave it life to kill it. Evidently, the five Justices in
today's majority value the former less, or the latter more, (or
both), than the four of us in dissent. Case closed. There is no
cause for anyone who believes in Casey to feel betrayed by this
outcome. It has been arrived at by precisely the process Casey
promised a democratic vote by nine lawyers, not on the question
whether the text of the Constitution has anything to say about this
subject (it obviously does not); nor even on the question (also
appropriate for lawyers) whether the legal traditions of the
American people would have sustained such a limitation upon
abortion (they obviously would); but upon the pure policy question
whether this limitation upon abortion is ``undue'' i.e., goes too
far.
</P>
<P>
   In my dissent in Casey, I wrote that the ``undue burden'' test
made law by the joint opinion created a standard that was ``as
doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in origin,''
``hopelessly unworkable in practice,'' ``ultimately standardless,''
Today's decision is the proof. As long as we are debating this
issue of necessity for a health-of-the-mother exception on the
basis of Casey, it is really quite impossible for us dissenters to
contend that the majority is  &UR; wrong &LR;  on the law any more than it
could be said that one is  &UR; wrong in law &LR;  to support or oppose the
death penalty, or to support or oppose mandatory minimum sentences.
The most that we can honestly say is that we disagree with the
majority on their policy-judgment-couched-as-law. And those who
believe that a 5-to-4 vote on a policy matter by unelected lawyers
should not overcome the judgment of 30 state legislatures have a
problem, not with the  &UR; application &LR;  of Casey, but with its
 &UR; existence &LR; . Casey must be overruled.

U.S. WINS A COMPROMISE ON WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States won an agreement Thursday to
keep the door open to further talks on its demand that no American
official or soldier be surrendered to the world's first permanent
court for war crimes as long as Washington has not signed the
treaty creating the court.
</P>
<P>
   European and other nations are determined to keep the United
States from being frozen out of the biggest change in international
law in decades. With their help, the Clinton administration's
ambassador at large for war crimes, David Scheffer, won an
agreement letting his delegation return to the final round of
negotiations on the form and functions of the court, in November.
Without the deal Thursday, the United States' participation would
have ended.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was immediately criticized by many independent legal
experts and official delegates here, who say that no exceptions
should be made for the United States. Exempting Americans, they
argue, only opens the way for officials of other nations _ some of
them ruled by dictators _ to avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The United States voted against the creation of the tribunal,
the International Criminal Court, two years ago because the
Pentagon and a Republican-controlled Congress had opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   The court will deal with war crimes, crimes against humanity and
genocide. In principle, the court will have universal jurisdiction,
regardless of which countries voted for the treaty to form it. That
power makes Washington nervous, believing that it would be
vulnerable to unfair or frivolous prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Scheffer said the United States would take the criticism into
account and try to devise safeguards as it prepares for further
negotiations. In the meantime, he said, it is important for the
United States to stay involved with the court as it comes into
operation over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs a permanent international criminal court,'' he
said in an interview with several reporters Thursday. ``We need it
because the perpetrators of these heinous crimes must be brought to
justice, and we need it as a deterrent over the generations that
follow. The international system simply cannot continue to deal
with these problems in an ad hoc manner indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court has tremendous potential for being a vehicle for
international justice, and we want to be able to see that
potential,'' he said. ``We should be able to assist the court and
cooperate with it when it's in our national interest to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scheffer, who helped create war crimes tribunals for the
Balkans and Rwanda, is in danger of being hamstrung over the next
few months by a bill recently introduced in the Senate by Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and John W. Warner, R-Va., that seeks to block any
American cooperation with the International Criminal Court as long
as the United States does not sign and ratify the treaty. Helms,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has vowed never
to allow ratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly a locomotive coming down on us,'' Scheffer said
of the bill Thursday. ``But I would hope that the locomotive stops,
because it's recognized that we are making progress in these
negotiations to achieve the very objective that is behind this
legislation. It is a counterintuitive piece of legislation because
it is undermining the very negotiating efforts that we are
undertaking to achieve the objective that we all agree must be
achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, delegates from more than 100 nations who have been
meeting here for three weeks are expected to approve two main
components of the court's business, the rules of procedure and a
document called ``the elements of crimes.'' These elements are a
compendium of legal definitions that Scheffer called a checklist
for prosecutors considering indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which once spoke more forcefully for
membership in the court, was instrumental in calling for more
specific criteria for war crimes, genocide and crimes against
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have war crimes and crimes against humanity and
genocide been defined with such precision as we now have in the
elements of crimes,'' Scheffer said. ``This will be the document
that guides prosecutors not only in the ICC but also in national
and military courts for decades to come.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``And defense counsel will look at this document to
determine where exactly their rights are in the defense of their
clients with respect to any particular crime. It's a truly historic
document. We invested a tremendous amount of our talent in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a November-December session, the last at which countries that
do not sign the treaty establishing the court will have the right
to participate in its affairs, the United States will argue for a
provision that allows specifically for an exemption from
prosecution. The accord reached Thursday generally paved the way
for that debate by raising the general question of international
agreements outside the court's treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, another American official was more cautious than
Scheffer in welcoming the move. ``Proponents of the court are
certainly not speaking for the American people,'' the official
said. ``It is inconceivable that the American people would support
the hauling of an American official before a court that is not
accountable to the American government when we are not party to the
underlying treaty. Ultimately, we're going to have to address this
more fundamental question.''

PIERRE PFLIMLIN, POLITICIAN WHO HELPED TO REBUILD FRANCE, DIES AT
93 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Algeria)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pierre Pflimlin, a French politician who promoted Western
Europe's postwar reconciliation and briefly, as prime minister, had
to cope with the uprising in Algeria and the imperial temper of
Charles de Gaulle, died Tuesday in Strasbourg. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Pflimlin had served as mayor of Strasbourg, the Alsatian capital
and his political base, from 1959 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He earned his spurs in the Catholic Resistance in World War II,
winning the Croix de Guerre. He held various ministerial posts from
the mid-1940s until 1962. Until 1989 he served as a member of the
European Parliament in Strasbourg, and was its president from 1984
to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Eugene Jean Pflimlin was born to Alsatian parents in
Roubaix, in French Flanders, and was educated at the Catholic
Institute in Paris and Strasbourg University. He practiced law in
Strasbourg from 1933 to 1964 and was elected a city councilman in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on 1946 he held cabinet portfolios in Paris dealing
with such diverse subjects as agriculture (one of his strongest
suits), finance, commerce and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He advocated negotiations with the nationalists in Algeria, so
his appointment as prime minister in May 1958 brought on a violent
reaction by French settlers there. In addition, the rebellious
stance of the French officer corps raised the specter of civil war
in France.
</P>
<P>
   With de Gaulle's attitude remaining a riddle, Pflimlin was
unable to calm the chaotic situation, and he resigned after 21 days
in office. After de Gaulle assumed the presidency, Pflimlin served
him as minister of state until 1959, when he won the mayoralty in
Strasbourg. His last national post was as Georges Pompidou's
minister of state for co-operation in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   A strong believer in a European identity, he was associated with
the architects of a fledgling economic union. He favored an elected
European parliament and served as president of a preparatory
assembly of the Council of Europe from 1963 to 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Pflimlin wrote the autobiographical ``Memoirs of a European''
(1991) and several other books.
</P>
<P>
   He was married in 1939 to Marie-Odile Heinrich, who has died,
and they had a son and two daughters.

NEW JERSEY SENATE BACKS `SAFE HAVEN' BILL FOR ABANDONED INFANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Williams-Mbengue, in line 39, is cq).  
By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Hoping to spare the lives of newborns whose
mothers are too desperate to care for them, the New Jersey Senate
gave final legislative approval Thursday to a bill that would allow
parents to abandon an infant at a hospital or police station
without facing criminal penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called safe-haven bill, which was passed by the Assembly
on Monday, would change the state's legal code, which currently
treats the abandonment of any child as a crime punishable by up to
10 years in prison. Gov. Christie Whitman is expected to sign the
bill into law, said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Texas became the first state to enact a safe-haven law last
year. Legislatures in 11 other states, including New York, have
approved similar measures this year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Trenton bill's sponsors, Sen. Gerald Cardinale, said
he thought such legislation could have prevented several recent
incidents in which New Jersey infants died after their parents had
abandoned them.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, five infants have been abandoned in New
Jersey, one of whom died. In 1996, a teen-age couple, Amy S.
Grossberg and Brian C. Peterson, made national headlines when they
threw their newborn son into a trash bin outside a motel in
Delaware, killing the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who find themselves with an unwanted pregnancy will know
that if they carry the baby to term, they can surrender custody of
the baby without having to go through all sorts of legal hoops,''
said Cardinale, a Bergen County Republican. ``They won't have to
reveal who the father is. They won't have a social worker trying to
change their mind. And they won't have to involve their parents or
relatives in the decision-making process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some child advocates contend that state-sanctioned dropoff
centers for infants could hinder the placement of abandoned
newborns in adoptive homes by complicating the legal child custody
issues because an abandoned child has no identifiable guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Williams-Mbengue, a policy analyst for the National
Conference of State Legislatures, said it was unclear whether the
laws would work. During the first four months the Texas law was in
effect, nine babies were abandoned across the state, none of them
at a hospital or police station.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the Texas law said the disappointing response
resulted from their failure to publicize the new law and they were
now raising money to start a statewide advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's bill would allocate $500,000 for a public awareness
campaign and establish a 24-hour toll-free phone line to inform
prospective parents about the law, said Sen. Diane Allen,
R-Edgewater Park.

BRAVES AND ROCKER TAKE THE FIRST ROUND AT SHEA
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is 6 feet 4 inches, but he may as well have been
80 feet tall Thursday night, the way his presence loomed over the
field like the billboard snaking up the light tower behind the Shea
Stadium bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker _ two years in the
majors, 25 on the planet _ was the reason a combined total of more
than 1,000 reporters and police officers showed up for a June ball
game. And he was the man 46,998 fans most wanted to see.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took a four-run lead midway through the game _
perhaps too wide a lead for a late-inning specialist like Rocker.
When Braves manager Bobby Cox called for Jason Marquis as his first
reliever, the fans chanted, ``We Want Rocker!''
</P>
<P>
   They had seen him only on video before the game, when the Mets
replayed his pre-game statement in which he apologized for his
offensive ranting in a December magazine article. They booed then,
and they stood and shouted when Rocker bolted from the bullpen
before the bottom of the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   His assignment was to protect the Braves' 6-4 lead, and as
usual, Rocker sprinted in. He was leaving the sanctuary the Mets
and the city had created _ a roof over the bullpen bench and mound
_ and with debris pelting the field as he ran, Rocker looked like a
soldier on a suicide mission through enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
   But he reached his destination safely, and there he won his war.
As the crowd chanted at him profanely, Rocker fell behind in the
count to Robin Ventura. But he came back, heaving 94 mph fastballs
that Ventura could not hit. Strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Zeile grounded out. So did Jay Payton. And that was that.
Calmly _ and with no more objects flying toward him _ Rocker had
set down the Mets' 5-6-7 hitters in order in a crucial spot.
</P>
<P>
   He walked off the mound slowly and slapped high-fives with
several teammates as he descended the steps into the third base
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg came on to save the 6-4 victory for the Braves
in the ninth, and the Mets' seven-game winning streak ended. The
Braves increased their lead in the National League East to three
games.
</P>
<P>
   The drama of Rocker's inning notwithstanding, the opener of the
four-game series did not display the quality of baseball expected
from the teams with the two best records in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' starter, the right-hander Rick Reed, fractured his
left wrist on a line drive and also strained a calf muscle. The
Braves' scheduled starter, Greg Maddux, was ill and never left the
hotel. The winning team made three errors. The losing team's
All-Star catcher lost track of the outs.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga tripled in a run in the first inning, the ball
eluding a charging Jay Payton, but Reed seemed in control after
retiring the first two Braves in the third. Then Andruw Jones came
up and smacked a liner off Reed's glove that went for an infield
single.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. Chipper Jones tripled off the right field wall,
and Galarraga followed with a 414-foot, opposite-field home run off
a billboard in right. The Braves were up, 4-0, and after Reed got
the final out, he was through for the night _ and perhaps a while
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who missed a start in April when a line drive bruised his
glove hand, will have the wrist re-examined Friday. The severity of
the calf strain was not immediately known, but Mets starter Bobby
J. Jones missed a month with that injury earlier this season, and
Reed missed three weeks with it last year.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, the four-time Cy Young award winner, was replaced by
John Burkett, a journeyman released this spring by the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. Maddux will start Saturday, when Burkett was scheduled
to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett faced a lineup that included seven .300 hitters, but he
held the Mets hitless his first time through the order. Melvin Mora
reached base on a two-out error in the third, and a walk and an
infield hit loaded the bases for Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza singled, bringing in two runs and giving him 12 games in
a row with at least one run batted in. The last National Leaguer
with a streak that long was the Cardinals' Rip Collins in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura came up next, but he struck out looking with runners at
first and third, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Reed had thrown his last pitch, and Pat Mahomes came on
to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's role was the one in which Mahomes is used most,
but if Mahomes can be used in a right-handed set-up role in tandem
with Turk Wendell, he could eliminate that need for the Mets as
they explore trades. If the Mets could count on Mahomes in the late
innings, they could then promote from within _ perhaps Grant
Roberts or Paul Wilson _ to fill the long-relief role.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahomes has been wild this year, and his one-out walk to
Chipper Jones put runners on first and second with one out in the
fifth. Mahomes then struck out Galarraga, but Piazza thought it was
the third out, and began to walk off with the ball. Mahomes shouted
at him, but Piazza could not hear him, perhaps because of a plane
taking off overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones took third and scored the Braves' fifth run when
Brain Jordan singled up the middle.  &QL;

ATTACK AD PUTS CLINTON ON THE DEFENSE AS RIVAL ACCUSES HER OF
HYPOCRISY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last two weeks, Hillary Rodham Clinton has
attacked Rep. Rick Lazio for missing a vote in Congress to create a
home-heating oil reserve so he could fly back home to campaign in
New York. The measure failed by two votes, a point Clinton has made
in speeches and television advertisements belittling her opponent
in the race for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign acknowledged Thursday that on the night of
the vote, she was at the side of another errant New York
representative, Eliot Engel, a Bronx Democrat who had left
Washington early to tend to his own political needs: a fund-raiser
in Westchester. And Lazio seized the information Thursday,
attacking Clinton as a ``hypocrite'' and demanding that she stop
running ads attacking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just the height of political chutzpah to go on the
attack, air commercials, and pretend that she had a role other than
what she had,'' Lazio said in a telephone call from Washington.
``Obviously the entire attack on her part was disingenuous. I think
it goes back to the central question of truth and truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge question of hypocrisy here,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said the first lady had been unaware that the
vote was going on when she appeared at Engel's fund-raiser on June
15, and Engel said he, too, was unaware of the vote that night.
Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said Clinton first learned
that the fund-raiser coincided with the vote from a campaign
briefing column that appeared in Newsday on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, who declined to say when he learned of the confluence
of the Engel fund-raiser and the vote, said that the first lady had
no intention of ending her attacks or withdrawing the television
commercial in question. He scoffed at Lazio's labeling of Clinton
as a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ad would have gone up and it is definitely staying up,''
Wolfson said. ``He still hasn't apologized for missing the vote.
He's a member of Congress. You're supposed to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Engel pointedly declined to back the
Clinton campaign's point of view. He said he did not believe Lazio
had done anything wrong, and that House Republican leaders were to
blame for changing the schedule without notifying members.
</P>
<P>
   Engel said he had left Washington in mid-afternoon after being
assured by the Republican leadership that Congress would adjourn by
6 p.m. As it turned out, the House stayed in session into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Clinton's criticism of Lazio was fair, Engel
responded: ``I don't know _ you know, that's a Senate campaign;
they've got to resolve that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not critical of anyone for missing that vote,'' Engel
continued. ``I think any vote that comes up after 6 p.m., when they
tell you it's going to be over at 6 p.m. _ people set up
alternative things to do. I criticize the Republican leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio took the 9 p.m. shuttle back to New York that night in
order to be on the ground Friday morning for a day of campaigning.
The disclosure that he missed the vote has become an issue both
because of the closeness of the outcome and because he has been
attacking the Clinton administration for escalating fuel costs. The
missed vote has not only given Clinton a campaign issue, but will
also make it more difficult for Lazio to leave Washington while
Congress is in session so he can tend to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Lazio's aides reacted with relief upon learning
where Clinton had been that night, and moved quickly to try to
stoke media interest in the report. ``Scoop city!'' Mike Murphy,
Lazio's chief media adviser, said in a voice mail message left for
a reporter. ``This is a huge hypocrite thing. She's running a TV ad
on it. We demand that she pull it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Lazio said he could not recall whether he knew
the vote was about to happen when he left Washington. (An aide
later called to say that Lazio had been told it was possible, but
not certain, that it was going to come up.)
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he did not believe that Clinton was unaware of
Engel's missing the vote when she began attacking Lazio for being
absent. ``It's plain she knew about it before she was airing attack
ads.''

FAA LIFTS THREAT OF STIFF SANCTION AGAINST ALASKA AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON and PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Satisfied with Alaska Airlines' plan to fix its maintenance
practices, federal officials Thursday lifted their threat of a
stiff sanction that could have forced the airline to ground planes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Aviation Administration also vowed to scrutinize
each plane leaving Alaska's maintenance hangars in coming weeks,
and it will carefully monitor the airline's progress in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   The agency earlier this month threatened to strip the airline's
authority to do heavy maintenance, a sanction never before imposed
on a major carrier. The FAA gave Alaska seven days prove it was
fixing problems, such as incomplete maintenance records and unclear
repair procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Word came Thursday that the Seattle-based airline had passed the
test.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska executives, pleased their plan got the FAA's nod, said
they were already looking ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge before us is to implement this plan, and we're
really well on our way to doing that,'' said Alaska President Bill
Ayer. ``It's now up to us to assure the FAA, ourselves and our
passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA launched an intensive safety audit of Alaska Airlines in
April, five weeks after Alaska Flight 261 plummeted into the
Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast, killing all 88
people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Problems found during that audit spurred the agency to take a
closer look at the nation's nine other major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The final report on Alaska Airlines, released Thursday, details
more than 50 findings. The shortcomings range from general to
specific, from management positions left vacant to ignored
maintenance manuals to missing signatures on paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that Alaska has a fleet of fairly new planes
and a dedicated workforce, but said there ``seems to be a basic
lack of understanding regarding the complexity of operating (an)
airline of this size.''
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials say they found no instances where unsafe planes
were flown.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has until July 12 to respond to the report. The FAA could
still sanction the airline in other ways, and Ayer acknowledged
there are ``very likely to be some fines.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline's chief executive officer, John Kelly, said Alaska
``tried to go above and beyond'' the FAA's expectation in
correcting flaws. One priority was to hire more people, and the
airline has already filled about 80 of 130 new slots in its
maintenance and engineering department.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has also revamped its general maintenance manual, which
the FAA criticized for being unclear, incomplete and ignored by
workers.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has appointed a new vice president of safety,
leading an 11-member safety team, and tripled its staff of
quality-assurance auditors.
</P>
<P>
   FAA officials said Alaska is headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the plan looks good,'' said Nick Lacey, director of
the FAA's Flight Standards Service in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Lacey said FAA inspectors will keep a close eye on Alaska until
mid-July, inspecting the paperwork for each plane as it is released
for flight after heavy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors will return to Alaska maintenance facilities
three months later, and six months after that. The agency wants to
ensure Alaska's plan is working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come back and look again and again,'' Lacey said.
``Should we not like what we find, we will not hesitate to take
stronger action.''
</P>
<P>
   As teams of FAA inspectors begin conducting ``white glove''
safety inspections on other carriers beginning July 17, they will
also be looking at the way their own agency does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audit in April found things that should have been found in
routine, day-to-day inspections,'' said FAA spokesman Paul
Takemoto.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alaska won a reprieve from the potentially crippling
sanction, its stock dropped in trading yesterday, falling $1.625,
to $26.56, or 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock took a tumble because the company is still battling
rising oil prices and because of a broader drop in the financial
markets, a financial analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 1.2 percent
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally this (FAA announcement) would have given it a shot in
the arm,'' said Raymond Neidl, an analyst who tracks Alaska Air
Group Inc. for ING Barings. ``There are other things going on in
the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price _ near its 12-month low of $25.50 _
isn't likely to attract anyone hoping to buy the nation's
10th-largest carrier, Neidl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (other airlines) have their thoughts in other
places right now,'' Neidl said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alaska plans to add 19 new Boeing 737s to its fleet in
the next two years, Ayer says executives are more concerned with
fixing problems than with growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, frankly, not going to grow the company very
aggressively until we feel like we have got a strong foundation
built,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And troubles still loom over the airline, which has been the
subject of federal scrutiny, criminal investigations and intense
publicity this year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in San Francisco is investigating whether
maintenance records were falsified in Alaska's Oakland hangar. No
indictments have been handed up, but the FAA investigated the same
allegations and recommended three maintenance supervisors lose
their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury recently broadened its investigation to the
handling of the plane that crashed, ordering Alaska to hand over
all of its maintenance paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board's crash investigation
is continuing, focusing on the MD-83's jackscrew assembly. The
plane's pilots reported a jammed horizontal stabilizer, which is
moved by the jackscrew to control the plane's angle of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance workers in Oakland planned to replace the plane's
jackscrew assembly in 1997, then determined its parts, while worn,
were within allowable limits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bright, often unflattering spotlight on the company,
Alaska officials say many passengers are standing by the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplanes are full,'' Ayer said. ``Looking at the numbers,
there's no evidence of an adverse impact.''

EDITORIAL: NADER'S MISGUIDED CRUSADE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader's long history of public service championing the
causes of consumers, the environment and economic justice
automatically commands respect. But in running for president as the
nominee of the Green Party, he is engaging in a self-indulgent
exercise that will distract voters from the clear-cut choice
represented by the major party candidates, Vice President Al Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush. His candidacy will be especially harmful
for Gore, the contender closest to Nader on the environment and
other issues. This political reality casts doubt on Nader's claim
to be driven by policy differences rather than ego.
</P>
<P>
   We are equally reluctant to see the main election choices
clouded by the spoiler candidacy of Patrick Buchanan on the Reform
Party ticket, an effort that seems likely to pull votes from both
Gore and Bush. Of course, both Buchanan and Nader have the right to
run. But given the major differences between the prospective
Democratic and Republican nominees, there is no driving logic for a
third-party candidacy this year, and the public deserves to see the
major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially distressing to see Nader flirt with the spoiler
role. For years, few Americans have made a more cogent critique of
the Washington influence game and the abuses of corporate power.
From his early attacks on automobile safety records to his most
recent advocacy of campaign finance reform, he has elevated issues
and sharpened Americans' awareness of flaws in their political
system. Nader acknowledges that on his traditional issues, Gore
would promise more progress than Bush. But because he regards Gore
as too much an incrementalist, Nader is saying in effect that he
would choose outright defeat for the Democrats over small steps
forward on those issues. That is a kind of irresponsibility that
more befits a Ross Perot than someone with Nader's record and
professed concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Nader may argue that he will force Gore and Bush to be more
sensitive to election fund-raising reform and environmental issues.
But the fact is that they have defined broad differences on these
two issues without his help. The main economic issue that divides
Nader from the major-party candidates is trade, and there, both
Gore and Bush have positions that are better for the wage-earning
voters that Nader claims to represent. For he and the Green Party
are against all the recent trade agreements, including American
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Nader clearly expects to use the trade issue to win votes from
disenchanted union members and other workers. But protectionism
runs counter to much of what Nader has fought for over the years.
Foreign competition has been a factor in forcing the automobile
industry to become more productive, fuel-efficient and profitable.
There are also far more American workers whose jobs depend on
exports, and whose families are able to buy less expensive goods
imported from overseas, than there are those dislocated by trade.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the last seven years under Clinton have been trying for
liberals. Nader's opposition to the death penalty, his scathing
critique of Democratic Party fund-raising and his willingness to
embrace unorthodox positions like the gasoline tax may all have the
effect of enlivening the public debate. But the only realistic role
he can play this year is to tilt swing states like California in a
conservative direction. Such an outcome would be contrary to the
policy thrust of his career and add an unbecoming chapter to his
legacy as a conscience-driven crusader.

LYNN PLAYS THROUGH THE PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The throbbing shoulders, particularly the right
one, with which he has fired a water polo ball for the past 27
years, don't waste many opportunities to explain to Robert Lynn
what toll the sport has taken on his body.
</P>
<P>
   And when the shoulders aren't complaining, maybe it's his aching
back or a knee which suffered cartilage damage that made hit
difficult for him to move his legs to keep himself above the water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, stopping because of the pain doesn't seem to be an option
for the 33-year-old Lynn, a native of Long Beach, graduate of
Wilson High and USC, the second-oldest player currently on the U.S.
National team and longtime veteran of the professional leagues in
Greece, Italy, Croatia and France. Which begs the natural question
- why not let your body say it's time to quit?
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2, 200-pound Lynn likens the situation to a marriage.
Even a person who loves their spouse, Lynn reckons, is caused some
pain by their partner. But the anquish is not enough reason to end
the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water polo, for me, is like a marriage,'' Lynn said. ``I love
playing too much to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   That logic shouldn't be surprising from a guy who learned to
swim at three and first played water polo at six. He was an
All-American and CIF Southern Section 4-A co-player of the year as
a senior in 1985 as a senior at Wilson and blossomed into one of
the country's best players as a four-time All-American at USC.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the U.S. national team in 1989 and, particularly
offensively, made an immediate impact. He had a team-leading 11
goals in the 1990 World Championships, trailed only teammate Chris
Humbert in goals during the 1991 French Open and was an integral
member of the FINA World Cup title team.
</P>
<P>
   The logical next step, Lynn figured, was to be one of 13 players
who traveled to Barcelona for the 1992 Olympic Games. That,
however, was a step that never came. When then-head coach Bill
Barnett selected his team, Lynn was not a member.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crushed me,'' said Lynn, who was 25 at the time. ``I can't
express the pain. I don't think he realized he changed an important
aspect of the team. I was a three-year starter. But how could I say
to him, you're wrong? When you're (25), how do you convince a
50-year-old man that he needs me?''
</P>
<P>
   Time hasn't answered those questions, but it has, at least
partially, healed old wounds. Lynn says he still doesn't understand
the decision but he's learned to accept it and respects Barnett,
who is serving as the video/scout coach currently for the U.S.
team.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the 1992 Olympics, Lynn began his professional
water polo life with a club team in France. That lasted two years
and included a pair of league championships. He left there to try
another shot at playing with the U.S. National team, but that
didn't work out and he moved to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two years in Italy, he moved to the powerful
Croatian leagues, where the crowds are big and vocal and the
players are considered celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, that was the highest level,'' said Lynn, the Croatian
Cup MVP in 1996. ``At that level, there was at least 10 solid teams
you had to beat. The other leagues there were probably four or five
teams and the others we would kill.''
</P>
<P>
   From there he moved to Greece for a year and has spent the past
two years back in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the European lifestyle,'' said Lynn, who added that he
would like to live somewhere in Europe, probably coaching water
polo, when his playing days are over.
</P>
<P>
   However, he also missed climbing out of the pool after a game
and hugging his parents. Or looking up into the stands to see his
grandmother and friends in the crowd. And there was also the
Olympic dream still burning in his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always joyful for me to play in front of my family,''
said Lynn, who comes home only for Christmas and in the summer. ``I
had gone so long playing away from home. It's funny, but there was
nowhere I felt more like a stranger than at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn approached U.S. National coach John Vargas about the chance
of joining the team. Vargas, who was a national teammate of Lynn's
from 1989-92, agreed to give him a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Robert came to the team in the late 1980's he was a great
offensive talent,'' Vargas said. ``He still is, but he has matured
and is much more of a complete and team player than he once was.''
</P>
<P>
   His former style as a player - which was to shoot first - was
born of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches I had gave me a green light to do what I wanted,''
Lynn said. ``That was my role. I wasn't just that I was a ball hog.
I was told to shoot a lot and attack a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   His style as a person saw him grow mature with the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young, hyper and out of control in a way,'' Lynn
admitted. ``I've done a lot of growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   With his new style, which is a two-meter defender with an
offensive threat, Lynn has fit well into the U.S. national team
system. He helped the team win a gold medal at the 1999 Pan
American Games and was on the third place squad in last year's UPS
Cup in Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, who is older than everyone on the prospective Olympic
squad but 34-year-old Kyle Kopp, is a good fit on a team full of
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot of guys who have played together for a
long time,'' said Chris Humbert, a 30-year-old two-meter man, who
is perhaps the team's best player. ``We've all paid our dues but
its time to do something good.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn has been a solid contributor during the current UPS
International Cup, which began on Tuesday and concludes on Sunday
at the U.S. National Aquatics Center in Los Alamitos. He had the
final goal in a 7-7 tie with Australia in the opener and
contributed a key goal in a 11-9 victory over Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he'll see if his recent efforts are enough to land him on
the U.S. team which will represent the country in Sydney in
September. Vargas will announce the 13-man team in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a good coach and an honest man,'' Lynn said. ``I'm
grateful he's given me a chance. I've kept the Olympic dream in
place for the last 12 years. But, you know, it won't kill me if it
doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With our without Sydney, Lynn will pack his bags and head back
to Europe to continue playing the sport that has been his life. He
would love to be able to take an Olympic experience home and it
would been even nicer to carry a medal with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful to finish off the dream,'' Lynn said.
``When it's over, I still be playing. I'll probably still play
until my arm falls off.''

CON ED PUT OFF UPGRADING INDIAN POINT OVER RATE FEARS
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Consolidated Edison decided in 1997 not to replace
the steam generator that would cause an accident at a Westchester
County nuclear reactor 2 1/2 years later because the company was
uncertain whether the move was a good financial bet in the
deregulated market that was developing, according to an internal
planning document.
</P>
<P>
   Some utility industry experts say the document may be the first
evidence that electricity deregulation can compromise nuclear
safety, a concern that critics have voiced for years.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, on Feb. 15 at Con Ed's Indian Point 2 nuclear
reactor in Buchanan, N.Y., was the most serious in the reactor's
27-year history. A small amount of radioactive steam escaped after
corrosion cracked a tube in one of the reactor's four steam
generators, which carry superheated radioactive water.
</P>
<P>
   While no one was hurt and Con Edison says the amount of
radiation released was tiny, the accident has had serious
consequences, including the shutting of the plant for at least five
months, and possibly longer, at a time of tight electricity
supplies. It has also complicated the company's efforts to sell the
reactor.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Con Ed financial planners concluded that
replacing the reactor's steam generators soon was the cheapest
option for customers and shareholders. Their analysis noted that
the generators were deteriorating _ a common occurrence in reactors
_ limiting how much electricity they could produce. And if the
generators were not replaced, they would have to be inspected more
often, cutting the number of days the plant could run, according to
the planners' document, which was provided to The New York Times by
Edward A. Smeloff, a utility expert at Pace University Law School
who has been critical of Con Ed's performance in running the
reactor.
</P>
<P>
   But Con Ed's analysis also pointed out that its financial
projections were highly sensitive to the price of electricity and
that postponing a decision would give the company an opportunity to
refine its estimates as the state made its transition to a
deregulated electricity market. That transformation happened last
November.
</P>
<P>
   In their analysis, the financial planners accepted a judgment _
which turned out to be wrong _ by Con Ed engineers that the
existing steam generators were safe for continued use, although if
kept in place they would need an extra inspection each year. As it
turned out, Con Ed got permission to skip the extra inspection in
1999; it would have been the last one before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the analysis, a vice president of Con Edison, Steven
E. Quinn, said Thursday that the benefit projected for replacing
the steam generators _ $85 million over 14 years _ was too small to
justify the financial risk, because the uncertainties were so
large. He said, though, that those uncertainties were not just the
future cost of power but also how well the plant would run after
the replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty on the assumptions was large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Con Ed analysis compared three options for the reactor:
replacing the steam generators and running the plant until its
license expired in 2013; not replacing the generators and running
the plant until 2013, but at a lower power level and with an extra
shutdown every year for inspections, averaging 30 to 36 days; or
simply retiring the plant in 1999 or 2001. The first option was
judged the least expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Smeloff, the director of the Pace Law School Energy Project and
a former utility manager, said in a telephone interview: ``Even
from a shareholder perspective, replacing steam generators in '99
made economic sense. If you assume management was acting in the
best interest of shareholders, this is the choice they would have
made.''
</P>
<P>
   But King Look, a section manager in Con Edison's generation
planning department and one of the authors of the document, said
the problem was that the financial projections were highly
sensitive to electricity prices, and that no one knew how those
prices would run in a deregulated market.
</P>
<P>
   The fear that deregulation may compromise reactor safety has
often been voiced but, experts say, seldom if ever borne out. In
1994, Ivan Selin, then chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, reacting to nascent signs of deregulation in
California, told reporters that ``even financially sound utilities
are under great pressure to reduce their rates, to be competitive;
they may be tempted to put off capital investment that we consider
necessary to maintain equipment in top shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June for
permission to restart the plant with the existing steam generators
and run it for up to 10 months without reinspection, although the
company now says it will replace the steam generators later this
year. The commission is expected to rule next month.

EDITORIAL: WATCHING MEXICO'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's presidential election Sunday will determine the outcome
of a very tight race between Francisco Labastida, of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and his center-right
rival, Vicente Fox. The vote will also be a test of how far Mexico
has progressed from the fraud-tainted elections of the recent past.
The close contest makes it imperative that all aspects of the
voting and ballot counting be scrupulously fair and transparent.
</P>
<P>
   The policy differences separating the two leading contenders are
relatively minor, particularly on issues concerning the United
States. Both Labastida and Fox are broadly pro-trade and
pro-business and would work comfortably with Washington on border
and drug issues. The third major candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
from the center-left, is given no realistic chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   A victory by Fox would dislodge the PRI from the presidency for
the first time since the party was formed by the victorious
generals of the Mexican Revolution 71 years ago. Such change is
overdue and would be a healthy development for Mexican democracy.
But a Labastida victory can also serve democracy if it is achieved
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past dozen years Mexico has made important strides
toward cleaning up its elections. A new, independent electoral
institute has been created to oversee the campaigning and assure an
honest count. Lists of eligible voters have been compiled and photo
identification cards issued to all qualified voters. Opposition
parties now have a better chance to get out their messages and more
confidence that voter choices will be respected.
</P>
<P>
   But serious problems remain, including the PRI's unchecked
ability to use government spending to support Labastida's candidacy
and the pervasive pro-government bias of most local broadcast and
print media. Some local PRI operatives have been posing as
``independent'' poll monitors or have intimidated voters with fears
that they will lose jobs or benefits if they fail to vote for the
PRI. Such behavior tarnishes Labastida's campaign and will
undermine his legitimacy if he wins. He must make every effort to
bring it to a halt. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' prediction this week that about half of all
15-year-olds in AIDS-plagued African countries will eventually die
of AIDS is the latest measure of the devastating impact of the
epidemic on the African continent. It is difficult to imagine what
kind of future may be in store for countries if half of their adult
populations will have died of the disease within coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   There are 16 African countries with critical infection levels.
This is a true emergency that requires vigorous action by the
countries affected and a greater flow of international aid and
expertise from the industrialized nations. Although American aid
has been increasing and some drug companies have slashed their
prices for AIDS drugs, more money is needed to buy medicine, build
up medical facilities and conduct research.
</P>
<P>
   But the most immediate need is education and prevention
programs, which are severely lacking in countries like Botswana
where stereotypes and misinformation about AIDS facilitate its
spread. UNAIDS has reported considerable success in Uganda and
Senegal, where advertising campaigns and educational efforts have
lowered infection rates. The key to such improvements is
recognition by the African governments that the AIDS crisis is a
priority. Domestic commitment and international support are
critical to saving Africa's next generation.

POLICE WATCH AS FANS JUST BOO ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker walked out of a side entrance of the
Atlanta Braves' midtown hotel Thursday afternoon and was quickly
escorted into an unmarked police van that would take him first to
the players association headquarters and later to Shea Stadium. So
began the pitcher's first day in the city he so notoriously
insulted in a magazine article last December, a day that ended
without any ugly incidents and with Rocker contributing to the
Braves' 6-4 victory over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the police van was one of dozens of measures that New
York police officials and Mets management took Thursday in the
hopes of keeping Rocker's presence from leading to any incidents
outside the stadium or in it. Police officers were stationed
outside the Braves' hotel, the Grand Hyatt, on East 42nd Street in
Manhattan, from the moment the Braves arrived in a bus from the
airport early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Those police were part of a contingent of more than 700 officers
deployed at the team hotel, along the Flushing subway line and at
Shea Stadium because of concerns about Rocker's safety, New York
officials said. City officials were relieved on Wednesday when
baseball officials sent assurances that Rocker would back down from
his vow to ride the No. 7 train _ the one Rocker had singled out
for verbal abuse in Sports Illustrated in December _ to Thursday
night's game against the Mets. But those assurances did not mute
the police presence.
</P>
<P>
   The department's bomb squad arrived at Shea about 2:30 p.m.,
followed by police officers carrying bags with sharp-shooting
rifles. Officers on horseback were in the stadium's parking lot,
while others in plainclothes mingled around the stadium. A unit of
officers with video cameras took positions in case of mayhem. It
seemed as if the Police Department was preparing for the arrival of
the president, and not the presence of a 25-year-old left-handed
reliever who has alienated many of his own teammates with the
uproar he has created with his derogatory comments toward gays and
immigrants and just about anyone not like Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy police presence seemed to work. Rocker was booed when
he first came on the field before the game and again when the Mets
played a videotape, on the scoreboard, of an apologetic statement
he made at a brief press gathering about 50 minutes before the game
started. But there were no incidents _ before the game or during
it. Rocker himself took part in the Braves' pre-game warm-up on the
field and even autographed a few baseballs. There were some insults
hurled his way, but nothing more. By 8 p.m., an hour into the game,
the police had sent 100 officers home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the game proceeded, the police made sure its presence
was known. Between half innings, about eight police officers stood
on each foul line, facing the crowd. Police officers were visible
in the back of the newly barricaded visitors' bullpen, where Rocker
was situated, and in the left-field bleachers adjacent to the
bullpen. There were fears the bullpen would be bombarded with
flying objects, but peace prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, in the eighth inning, Rocker entered the game, with
just one object _ a rubber ball _ apparently being thrown his way.
Amid derisive chants, but nothing more, he proceeded to strike out
Robin Ventura and retire Todd Zeile and Jay Payton on ground balls.
He walked off the field with his head up, seeming to fight the urge
to flash the smirk that was so familiar when he clashed with Mets
fans in last year's postseason.
</P>
<P>
   During his pre-game statement, Rocker seemed to make an effort
to be humble, flashed a grin or two, said that most New Yorkers
were ``extremely charismatic, although a bit spirited'' and
apologized several times for all the negative remarks he has made.
Braves officials said that Rocker had written the statement
himself, scribbling it on a piece of paper in his hotel room at 2
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Rocker also said that he was ``happy to be
back in New York'' and that it was unfortunate that ``the situation
has continued to escalate.'' He asked reporters _ more than 300 are
here for the four-game series _ to refrain from asking questions
about anything other than baseball. Rocker spent the early part of
his day in the hotel. At about 12:30 p.m. he took an unmarked
police van to the players' union headquarters. Hours later, he
returned to the hotel, and at about 4:30 p.m. _ back in the van _
he arrived at Shea. Rocker is being shadowed by an Atlanta police
lieutenant, and the police want to limit his itinerary while he is
here.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are successful remains to be seen. Before the game,
several dozen fans took part in an anti-Rocker rally outside Shea,
but hundreds of other fans walked right past, with any number
saying the whole Rocker situation had been blown out of proportion.

TOBIN ROTE, 72, A CHAMPIONSHIP QUARTERBACK FOR THE LIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tobin Rote, an outstanding quarterback for 16 years in three
professional football leagues and the architect in 1957 of the
Detroit Lions' last National Football League championship, died
Tuesday at a hospital in Saginaw, Mich. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Julie, said he suffered a heart attack, almost two
weeks after back surgery. His back and knees were battered from
football, and he had undergone knee replacement and triple-bypass
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rote began his pro career in Green Bay, playing for the Packers
from 1950 through 1956. The Packers made Bart Starr, a future Hall
of Fame quarterback, their first draft choice in 1956 _ even though
Rote led the NFL in touchdown passes (17) in 1955 and went on to
lead the league in passing yards (2,203) and touchdowns (18) in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   During training camp in 1957, the Packers traded Rote to the
Lions, who used him to back up Bobby Layne, another future Hall of
Fame quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   When Layne broke an ankle in the next-to-last game of the 1957
regular season, Rote replaced him. Two weeks later, in the Western
Division championship game, the San Francisco 49ers led the Lions,
24-6, at halftime, and started celebrating early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hear them laughing,'' Rote once recalled. ``The walls
were paper thin. They were going on about how they were going to
spend their championship game money. It made us angry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Lions scored three touchdowns within
five minutes and won, 31-27. The following Sunday, they routed the
Cleveland Browns, 59-14, and won their third NFL title in six
years. Rote passed for four touchdowns and ran for one.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions were so impressed that early in the 1958 season they
traded the popular, free-wheeling Layne. Then they won only seven
games over that season and the next, and Rote was gone.
</P>
<P>
   From 1960 through 1962, Rote played for the Toronto Argonauts of
the Canadian Football League and broke all their passing records.
When the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League offered
him a $10,000 raise to $35,000 a year, he moved there for two
seasons and led them to a league title. He sat out the 1965 season,
played three games for the Denver Broncos of the AFL in 1966 and
then retired.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin Cornelius Rote Jr. was born in San Antonio. At 6 feet 2
inches and 211 pounds, he led Rice University to a Southwest
Conference title. In 149 games over 13 pro seasons in the United
States, he passed for 18,850 yards and 149 touchdowns and rushed
for 3,128 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After his pro career, he became a corporate executive in
Detroit. In 1993, he and his wife retired to a Lake Huron
waterfront home in Port Hope, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Rock Rote, of
Delafield, Wis., a sports broadcaster; daughters Julie Struble, of
Bay City, Mich., and Toni Stapley, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; seven
grandchildren; a sister, Barbara Rote of San Antonio; and a cousin,
Kyle Rote, the former wide receiver for the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   As a Lion, he never received the credit he deserved, partly
because Detroit fans considered him an interloper from Green Bay
and partly because he replaced the popular, flamboyant Layne. But
his teammates appreciated him.
</P>
<P>
   As Joe Schmidt, the Lions' Hall of Fame linebacker, said when he
heard of Rote's death, ``It was a blessing that he was here.''  &QL;

OLYMPICS: A TALE OF THE TAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dick Ebersol should have been drooling
uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, as the chief of NBC Sports was beamed via satellite
to all the network affiliates Wednesday to give a progress report
on the upcoming coverage of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he subtly
slipped in a few interesting facts that, when closer examined,
should have a chilling effect on the future coverage of live
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the advertising sales and contributions from the
affiliates, ``we will eke out a small profit,'' Ebersol said,
mentioning that the $705 million in rights fees the network had to
put up for this event would probably be offset by $900 million in
sponsors contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, there's going to be fewer advertising minutes per
hour during the 84 hours of prime time - just 9 minutes as opposed
to the 9 that they did in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, they project more viewers for these Aussie games
than watched four years ago - 215 million, this after Atlanta set a
record with 206 million, he figured they'd actually lose about $70
million on the proposition.
</P>
<P>
   And, he repeated for those hard of hearing, it'll all be on tape
- 441 hours, divided up between the network and its two cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   All of which only reinforces the foundation of his grand scheme.
No matter how much anyone screams for a live Olympics, it doesn't
make business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, we made the decision for all videotape,''
Ebersol repeated, despite the fact some media outlets still believe
he'll change his mind sometime before the Sept. 15 opening
ceremonies. ``The first three days of the Olympics, we've made a
commitment to telling viewers that it's all on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Rub it in, more like.
</P>
<P>
   We've already been over the fact that a prime-time event in
Australia will pretty much be a prime-time event on the West Coast
(which is 18 hours behind). That means West Coast newspapers will
have a fair amount of same-day results of major events in the next
day's edition. But NBC will show them about 24 hours after they
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those NBC events, Ebersol disclosed, will be the
``family coverage,'' or individual-type sports that fall into the
``Up Close and Personal'' category, such as swimming, gymnastics
and track and field. The cable outlets - MSNBC and CNBC - will be
the dumping ground for team sports and boxing.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're hard up enough to actually want to know results as
they happen, Ebersol said that the network's Web site -
nbcolympics.com - will take care of that.
</P>
<P>
   Which, again, is great news for anyone who doesn't have cable
TV, let alone a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Apologist: All it took for Lakers center Shaquille
O'Neal to get back into the good graces of his fellow striking
Screen Actors Guild members was to issue a nice statement of
support following all the guff he took for his participation in the
gratuitous Disneyland commercial after the Lakers won the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through two work stoppages in my career, and I know
how very difficult they are to union members and their families,''
O'Neal's statement read, making no mention of how agent Leonard
Armato has been trying to spin the appearance as a public service
announcement. ``As a SAG and AFTRA member, I fully support the
strike and hope that negotiations can resume in the very near
future so both sides can get back to business as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A SAG spokesman told the Hollywood Reporter that O'Neal wouldn't
face disciplinary actions, but SAG joint strike committee chairman
Todd Amorde was quoted as saying: ``I have a real issue with
Disney, with Nike and all these other corporations making a cynical
grab to exploit young athletes and performers during their moment
of glory and use them to bust our unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's bite: Notice how no one in the TNT studio would follow
up when Charles Barkley tore into the Clippers after they picked
high schooler Darius Miles during Wednesday's NBA draft coverage?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Clippers are a good environment for the
Miles kid,'' said Barkley, who wasn't in the studio but at his home
doing remote analysis. ``They are a terrible organization ... I
hope he gets out of there. They should've re-signed their two free
agents (Derek Anderson and Maurice Taylor).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clippers are one of the problems in sports. People think
you have to win to make money, and the Clippers are a perfect
example of a team that lets all of their good players go every year
and just keeps giving the fans a bad product. People assume that
every organization is trying to win, and there's just no excuse for
what the Clippers have been doing the last 10 to 15 years, letting
all their good players go.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the gang in Minnesota, anchor Ernie Johnson and analysts
Rick Majerus, John Thompson and Kenny Smith were as responsive as a
snow plow.
</P>
<P>
   At least Thompson has an excuse - he's been mentioned as a
possible new Clippers coach. In fact, after the team traded for
Orlando's Corey Maggette, Derek Strong and Keyon Dooling, Thompson
said: ``It may be time to go back for another interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Might as well. Your TV work has shown an astonishing display of
mediocrity since you left Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   More interoffice bashing: It was crazy enough for the Atlanta
Braves to order that TBS broadcasters Skip Caray, Pete Van Wieren,
Don Sutton and Joe Simpson be left off the charter after they
exposed the shortening of the catcher's box at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   You know that they all work for the same company, right? Imagine
the Fox-owed Dodgers punishing Fox Sports Net play-by-play legend
Vin Scully by making him fly commercial after he questions another
one of Davey Johnson's suspect managerial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But then, CNN sports anchor Vince Cellini, another Time-Warner
employee under Ted Turner's fiefdom, throws in his opinion on
Tuesday's ``Sports Night'' after the broadcasters were reinstated:
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta get a timeout. I mean, kicking the Braves announcers
off Monday's chartered flight to Montreal is beyond absurd. I never
thought the acerbic Skip Caray could ever be a sympathetic figure,
but Braves president Stan Kasten made it happen. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the Braves needed was another public relations
gaffe - but old Stan served one up. ... Is that how you treat
longtime employees? How petty. How small. And this announcer
doesn't care how this flies with Stan.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Cellini and the points over Kasten in the company picnic's
water balloon toss competition.
</P>
<P>
   The last word: Said Skip on the TBS telecast as John Rocker
walked off the mound after throwing a shutout inning against the
Mets on Thursday night and went straight to the dugout: ``Not a
word, my friend ... way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   -The sight of 1150-AM's Arnie Spanier hosing down cars in Studio
City on Thursday, making good on a promise to wash everyone's
vehicle in L.A. if the Lakers won the NBA championship. It may not
be the most original sports-talk radio promotion, but at least this
does the city good while wasting some of Northern California's
water at the same time. Spanier took it upon himself to even steam
clean a few engines - using only his own breath.
</P>
<P>
   -The extended piece - 14 minutes, in fact - that Fox Sports
Net's National Sports Report did on Atlanta Braves pitcher John
Rocker during Wednesday night's ``Open Mike'' segment. Credit FSN
producer Sean Pamphilon with doing a masterful job editing the
various opinions from national journalists, clergymen, an AIDS
activist and kids who live in Macon, Ga. - Rocker's home town. It
was then followed up by some interesting commentary by anchor Keith
Olbermann, who questioned the media's role in how to cover this
``story,'' including whether Fox Sports Net was justified in doing
this piece considering it could be construed as promotion for its
airing Thursday night's Braves-Mets game (plus Saturday's game on
the network to nearly half the country).
</P>
<P>
   -Fox and NBC told baseball there'd be no walk-off victory after
the networks were informed it'd be in their best interest to pay
triple the rights fees if they wanted to keep promoting their
product on an annual basis. If Fox has to pay $345 million a year
(instead of $115 million) and NBC is supposed to kick in $240
million (over their current $80 million), guess who's gonna be
footing that bill?
</P>
<P>
   -Marv Albert, on TNT's coverage of Wimbledon, talking about
ex-UCLA star Justin Gimelstob on Wednesday's telecast: ``Recruiters
made certain to keep Justin away from Bill Walton before the
decision was made to attend UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   -First Anna Kournikova, now Dennis Miller on the cover of Sports
Illustrated. Next, a follow-up on the controversy surrounding how
Derek Jeter was No. 2 behind George Clooney on People magazine's
list of the most eligible bachelors in the country.
</P>
<P>
   -Sport magazine will suspend publication following its August
issue, citing a huge loss in advertising revenue, according to
Peterson Publications.
</P>
<P>
   -We now understand why Jason Kapono reconsidered applying for
the NBA draft - had he been picked, UCLA basketball coach Steve
Lavin would have been right there (after leaving the Jermoe Moiso
press gathering) to be his media spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   -Chick Hearn's summer vacation - doing more Sparks games for
KCAL Channel 9. Why not take a break? Starting with Saturday's
broadcast (5 p.m.), he'll be on three of the next four Saturdays.
Did you know: He actually did play-by-play on the Sparks' TV game
Sunday, June 18 - the day before the Lakers' clinched the NBA
title?
</P>
<P>
   -Reader contribution of the week: When ESPN2 aired a delayed
broadcast of Sunday's CART race from Portland, it continued to run
its sports ticker at the bottom of the screen. Which, a half-hour
into the race, revealed the winner.
