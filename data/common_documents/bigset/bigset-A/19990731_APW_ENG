<HEADLINE> Rather Would Be Happy Chasing Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though he's a multi-million dollar anchor  
man, Dan Rather likes to pound the pavement just like a 
rank-and-file journalist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm chasing my dream of trying to be a great reporter,'' the  
CBS veteran told the Aug. 9 edition of People magazine. ``If I 
can't be the smartest or most affable person on television, I can 
be the hardest-working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, 67, makes $6 million a year to anchor the network's  
evening news, and has no plans to retire, even after his contract 
expires in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like anchoring,'' he said, ``but if tomorrow someone said,  
'Dan, we'd like to have somebody else,' I'd say 'Fine. Make me the 
AP bureau chief in Alpine, Texas, and I'll be very happy.'''

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Hits Moon, No Dust Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lunar Prospector's violent collision with the  
moon on Saturday left no visible cloud of dust, but researchers 
still hope to find traces of water in a vapor plume possibly 
created by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 observatory telescopes focused on the moon's south  
pole as the spacecraft, in its final task for science, dove toward 
a frozen crater and smashed itself around 5:52 a.m. EDT Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts hoped the fire and violence of the collision, unseen  
from the Earth, would vaporize ice thought to exist in the shaded 
crater and send a wet plume, detectable by special instruments, 
spiraling into the lunar sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin S. Barker of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory,  
a lead researcher in the project, said telescopes equipped with 
ultraviolet detectors took hours of data following the impact, 
searching for the chemical signature of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really too early to draw any conclusions,'' Barker said.  
``So far, we haven't seen anything that says water or anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final results of the water search await analysis of the readings  
by the telescopes in Texas, California, Massachusetts and Hawaii, 
and by the Hubble Space Telescope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	What researchers are looking for is either water, H2O, or the  
hydroxyl radical, called OH, formed when sunlight splits a hydrogen 
atom away from a water molecule. Both OH and water have distinctive 
spectroscopic signatures when viewed with special telescope 
filters. 
</P>
<P>
	The signature for water could be found quickly in the data, said  
Barker, but uncovering evidence of the hydroxyl radical could take 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for water is more than a scientific curiosity. Large  
stores of ice on the moon would make it much easier and cheaper to 
establish a base there, or to use the moon as a way station to more 
distant bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Water can be broken down chemically into hydrogen and oxygen  
that can propel a rocket or power generators. Oxygen also would 
provide a breathable atmosphere for lunar explorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was scheduled to end its mission on Saturday,  
and scientists running the $63 million project decided smashing the 
craft into the moon in search for water was a fitting end. 
</P>
<P>
	David Morse, a NASA spokesman at the Ames Research Center in  
Moffett Field, Calif., said mission scientists ``were very happy 
and whooped it up a little'' when it became clear the craft had hit 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and spent about 18 months  
in lunar orbit, using five instruments to map the magnetic, 
chemical and gravitational character of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	One instrument received a signal for hydrogen, leading  
scientists to suggest there was frozen water in the deep, 
constantly shaded craters around the lunar poles. By some 
estimates, the could be as much as 300 million metric tons of ice 
in the frozen lunar soil. 
</P>
<P>
	David B. Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher, was the  
first to suggest using Prospector as sort of a rocket-powered 
diving rod. He did calculations that showed if Prospector crashed 
into one of the frigid craters, heat from the impact could vaporize 
the ice and form a wet cloud visible from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although mission scientists believed there was only a 10 percent  
chance of success, the possibility of harvesting a final bit of 
science was worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said Saturday that he also had hoped for a dust cloud,  
but none was seen by any of the 20 or so observatory telescopes 
that focused on the moon at the moment of impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't see any dust. It is a bit of a disappointment,'' he  
said. ``We know it crashed. We just don't know where exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers,  
or ALPO, encouraged amateur astronomers to focus telescopes on the 
moon and report any signs of Prospector's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of obvious evidence, officials said Lunar  
Prospector appeared to have followed the instructions from the 
ground to slow itself with an automatic rocket firing and then 
smash against the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact point was not visible from Earth, but NASA engineers  
believe that the craft was in line to hit the target crater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went normally, so we have every reason to believe  
it made it to the impact site,'' said David Folta, the Goddard 
Space Flight Center engineer who gave the final guidance signals to 
Prospector. ``There is no reason to believe we didn't get to where 
we wanted to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folta said the spacecraft received the signals and was operating  
normally when it went over the lunar north pole and disappeared 
behind the moon where it was to ignite its rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the rocket firing failed, said Folta, the craft would have  
reappeared in orbit, still sending out radio signals. Instead, 
there was only silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker said there is a possibility the spacecraft hit at such a  
shallow angle that it skipped, like a flat stone across a pond, 
before it came to rest. This would diminish the dust cloud, he 
said, but there could still be a water plume.

<HEADLINE> $54 Million McNabb Misses Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Donovan McNabb spent his first day as the  
highest-paid player in Philadelphia Eagles history in much the same 
fashion as the previous week or so. 
</P>
<P>
	No helmet. No pads. No football.  
</P>
<P>
	More waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's seven-year, $54 million contract was so long and  
complicated that by the time the NFL let him sign it, it was too 
late to join his new team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb finally put his signature on the 32-page contract  
Saturday afternoon, but not until his teammates had finished two 
grueling workouts in near 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like the discordant boos he received on draft day and the  
controversial holdout that followed, it wasn't the kind of debut 
McNabb had envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan will perform so well that looking back on this moment  
today, in 100 degrees here, 15 years from now we can count the 
number of Super Bowls we've won together,'' Eagles owner Jeffrey 
Lurie said. ``Not the number of days held out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's journey from No. 2 draft pick to official pro football  
player has been a strange one, for sure, especially in the past 72 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the first several days of workouts due to a  
contract squabble, McNabb then looked on helplessly as his agent 
lit a firecracker of controversy under the talks with an assertion 
that race was playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat in a plane at the Atlanta airport for three hours while  
trying to get to Philadelphia, then arrived at Veterans Stadium 
after midnight. McNabb and his teammates had every reason to 
believe he'd be doing what he does best -- throwing a football -- a 
few hours later at Lehigh University. 
</P>
<P>
	But McNabb was excused from the morning workout, staying at his  
Cherry Hill, N.J., home until mid-morning while several teammates 
were knocked out of practice with heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there was little time for McNabb to have a physical,  
and there were plenty of details to work out with the league. Joe 
Banner, the Eagles' executive vice president, said NFL lawyers 
required some language in the contract reworded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan is not allowed to sign the contract until it's all OK,  
and he is not allowed to practice until he signs the contract,'' 
Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb showed up for an afternoon news conference toting a  
playbook under his arm. He's going to need it. Starting quarterback 
Doug Pederson already knows coach Andy Reid's offense, and he's 
been practicing while McNabb has been sitting idle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is that because he's the No. 1 pick and a high  
pick, his talent is going to allow him to walk in and play 
immediately,'' offensive coordinator Rod Dowhower said. ``Reality 
is, Doug knows this offense. Doug knows how to execute this 
offense. The rest of the offensive players need to catch up with 
Doug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, seated next to Lurie, didn't blink when the owner called  
him ``a potential franchise quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, it's over, and I can participate with the rest of the  
team,'' McNabb said. ``I don't put any pressure on myself that's 
not needed. Ever since I was a member of the Syracuse Orangemen, I 
had the label as being `The Man' as you may call it. That didn't 
bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb didn't seem concerned about the time he's missed, calling  
his first NFL training camp ``more of a touch-up, a deal that all 
quarterbacks need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not what Dowhower or Reid would want to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to learn is to do,'' Dowhower said. ``That goes  
for everybody. ... This is professional football. There's a certain 
reality to it. If you want to make a lot of money, you've got to be 
the starter, at some point. Sometimes, you walk into a lot of money 
and you're not the starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New details emerged Saturday about McNabb's contract and how it  
compares with deals given to other top quarterbacks like Tim Couch, 
the No. 1 pick this year, and Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, the top 
two picks in last year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb got an $11.3 million signing bonus, but the deal does not  
include the voidable years or buy-back clause for which Smith had 
pushed. That means McNabb cannot earn a second signing bonus, and 
it could hinder agent Leigh Steinberg's attempt to get that kind of 
deal for No. 3 pick Akili Smith of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	A highly placed NFL source who has seen McNabb's contract said  
it could be worth $53.7 million if he achieves all the bonuses and 
so-called escalator clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said McNabb  
would earn significant bonus money if he's in the top eight in the 
league in any of 4-5 passing categories in any of the first four 
years. The bonuses are higher if he's in the top five, and even 
higher if he's in the top three in any category during any season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some bonus money also is tied to making the playoffs or Pro  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Escalated salaries in years 5-7 of the contract would kick in if  
McNabb achieves certain passing statistics that are very attainable 
if he simply gets playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who is also familiar with the contracts signed by  
Couch, Manning and Leaf, said McNabb ranked behind Couch in total 
value and ahead of Manning and Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	If he achieves all the incentives in his contract, Couch could  
earn as much as $59.4 million for seven years, the source said. 
Manning could make $48 million for six years and Leaf could get a 
little more than $31 million for five years by achieving all the 
incentives.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russian Bank Hid Deals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Auditors have found that Russia's Central Bank  
kept its transactions with an offshore company off its accounting 
books and hid the profits it made on the nation's treasury-bill 
market, a newspaper reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes just days after the International Monetary Fund  
approved a new, $4.5 billion loan program for Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The news again raises questions of whether Russian finance  
officials have been straight with Western lenders, whether they are 
truly committed to reforming the battered economy and whether they 
have violated not only IMF guidelines, but also Russian law. 
</P>
<P>
	The auditors from PriceWaterhouseCoopers have been working on a  
contract for the IMF, which wanted to learn more about the Central 
Bank's relationship with the Financial Management Co., or FIMACO. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1993 through 1997, the bank secretly sent billions of  
dollars of its foreign reserves to the company, based in Britain's 
Channel Islands and is effectively under Central Bank control. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF had never been informed by Russian officials that they  
were moving funds, presumably including IMF money, out of the 
country. The bank's relationship with the offshore firm was 
publicly revealed earlier this year by Russia's embattled 
prosecutor-general, Yuri Skuratov. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank officials have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.  
They said that the bank had channeled the money through FIMACO 
because it feared Russia could default on debts and international 
creditors would try to seize the nation's assets. 
</P>
<P>
	PriceWaterhouseCoopers found that the bank had kept double  
books, recording all its transactions with FIMACO outside the bank 
accounting registers, The Moscow Times reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Auditors also discovered that the bank had made profits by  
trading IMF loans and the nation's hard-currency reserves on the 
Russian short-term treasury bill market and neither recorded the 
profit nor shared it with the government, The Moscow Times said, 
citing the unpublished audit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Central Bank also lent $300 million of hard-currency  
reserves to commercial banks, the audit said, according to The 
Times.

<HEADLINE>  Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp's secret recordings of  
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky were meant to bring 
presidential misconduct to light, and she should be praised, not 
prosecuted, her lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury thought otherwise, indicting Mrs. Tripp on  
state wiretapping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, which followed a yearlong investigation, makes  
Mrs. Tripp the only major figure in the sex scandal to face a 
criminal charge. Each offense carries up to five years in prison 
and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp spokesman Philip Coughter called the investigation ``the  
most disgraceful, transparent campaign of politically motivated 
vengeance in recent American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's new attorney Stephen Kohn, who has handled numerous  
government whistle-blower cases, compared her to civil rights 
heroes who broke minor state laws to battle injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal law protects Mrs. Tripp as a government witness  
in a corruption case. Kohn said he will challenge the state's 
authority to bring charges because she was given immunity by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr when she turned over the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn likened the Maryland investigation to the McCarthy-era  
communist witch hunts and said Friday's indictment ``will have a 
chilling effect on witnesses who have the courage to document and 
report official misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli, who led the grand jury  
investigation, said simply, ``I think she broke the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He waved off suggestions that the case would be viewed as  
politically motivated. ``I can't help how it will be seen. ... I 
think we've done our duty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli, a Democrat appointed to his post in 1984, said he  
would handle the case himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on one count of illegal  
interception, for taping a phone conversation on Dec. 22, 1997, 
after she was told by her lawyer that secret taping was illegal. In 
conversations taped that day, the two women discussed what they 
should say about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with Clinton in 
testimony they expected to have to give for Paula Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also was charged with disclosing the contents of that  
conversation to Newsweek magazine, which published a partial 
transcript of a Tripp-Lewinsky phone call on Feb. 2, 1998. A 
spokeswoman for Newsweek, Jan Angilella, said magazine officials 
would not comment on the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and representatives of Ms. Lewinsky also  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Tripp's more than 20 hours of recordings that  
launched the independent counsel's investigation of Clinton's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings of the two women's rambling and sometimes ribald  
conversations were released publicly by the House Judiciary 
Committee before the House voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and 
obstruction. He was acquitted Feb. 12 after a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's wiretap law, which is infrequently prosecuted,  
forbids taping phone conversations without the other party's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. But Mrs. Tripp, who  
recorded the calls in her Columbia, Md., living room, testified for 
Starr's grand jury that she taped several conversations in late 
1997 even after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be allowed to arrange a time to surrender  
voluntarily, her attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, has said she began taping her friend's phone  
calls to protect herself because she was being pressured by Ms. 
Lewinsky to lie in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky confided her sexual encounters with the president  
to Mrs. Tripp after the pair became friends while working together 
at the Pentagon. Ms. Lewinsky wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge 
of the relationship in an affidavit for Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr gave Ms. Lewinsky immunity from prosecution in return for  
her testimony against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who testified in Starr's  
investigation last November, said she had urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. Mrs. Tripp also talked with her about writing a tell-all 
book about her years at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in New York, Ms. Goldberg said, ``Now she will  
be able to have her day in court and tell her side of the story.''

<HEADLINE> Duval, Woods To Play After Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) -- David Duval says he will play the Greater  
Hartford Open to the end even if the tournament carries into 
Monday, when he is to play in a made-for-television match with 
Tiger Woods in California that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here. That's my obligation,'' he said Saturday after  
finishing the third round at 4-under par, 11 strokes off the lead 
and all but out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance of severe weather late Sunday afternoon was so  
strong, the PGA moved up the starting time for the final round two 
hours to 7 a.m. EDT. To complete the tournament by 2 p.m., players 
will start their final round from both the first and tenth tees. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event severe weather should hit in the morning, the final  
round could be postponed until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is to go against Woods in an 18-hole match play exhibition  
Monday night at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif. It 
is to be televised live. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval said he didn't see that as a problem if the GHO continues  
Monday morning. He said he likely would finish the GHO by noon, 
giving him enough time to get to California for the ``Showdown at 
Sherwood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that would come into question,'' he said. ``I've  
got plenty of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The matchup is similar to ``Shell's Wonderful World of Golf,''  
which features two golfers going head-to-head. It was played from 
1962 to 1973 and was brought back in 1994. It has been televised on 
ESPN the past two years, but on tape delay. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC will begin the broadcast at 8 p.m. EDT with the match  
already underway. The golfers likely will have completed a few 
holes by then. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is scheduled for three hours and the round is expected  
to last about 30 minutes longer than that. If there's a playoff and 
darkness becomes a factor, the 17th and 18th holes will be 
artificially lighted.

<HEADLINE> Jets Counting on QB Testaverde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Earlier this week, New York Jets  
quarterback Vinny Testaverde continuously stressed how excited he 
was about getting on the field for another season. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday morning, he showed how much.  
</P>
<P>
	After being swatted at by linebacker Olrick Johnson following a  
flea-flicker scramble, the Pro Bowler exchanged words with the 
rookie, flung the ball at him and then shoved the defender hard in 
the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	The team loved it.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's all right,'' coach Bill Parcells said later, smiling.  
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are counting on Testaverde's emotion again this season  
as they prepare for the defense of the franchise's first-ever AFC 
East championship. The veteran quarterback's remarkable resurgence 
last year, during which he went 12-1 as a regular-season starter, 
was the vital cog in a march to the conference title game against 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about it quite a lot,'' the 35-year-old  
quarterback said. ``I haven't had the greatest nights of sleep this 
past week. I'm ready to get this started. It's my 13th camp, and 
I'm a little surprised by just how ready and how hungry I am for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	En route to his second Pro Bowl selection in the past three  
seasons, Testaverde posted one of the best statistical seasons in 
league history, throwing 29 touchdowns compared to only seven 
interceptions. In his inaugural campaign with the Jets after being 
waived by the Baltimore Ravens, the former University of Miami 
standout completed 259 of 421 passes for 3,256 yards and an 
AFC-best 101.6 passer rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Testaverde finds himself battling the doubts of some who  
recall his erratic, interception-riddled seasons with the woeful 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1987-92. He also played for the Cleveland 
Browns from 1993-95 under current Jets assistant Bill Belichick. 
</P>
<P>
	``One or two games, maybe that's a fluke,'' Testaverde said.  
``To do it week in, week out, I don't think that's a fluke. That's 
hard work and dedication.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets agree. During the offseason, Testaverde signed a  
three-year, $19.5 million contract that includes options that may 
eventually pay him $27 million over seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll be better,'' receiver Wayne Chrebet said. ``What  
he did last year, he did in 12 games. Imagine what he can do in 16 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added wideout Keyshawn Johnson, ``What Vinny did last year is  
what high-level quarterbacks, guys like Steve Young and Mark 
Brunell, do every year. Vinny probably hasn't had the opportunity 
to do it. Now he has it, and I think he'll live up to the 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two days of the Jets' sweat-soaked training camp,  
Testaverde slipped easily into the leadership role. With former 
backup Glenn Foley, who begin last year as the starter, shipped off 
to Seattle, Testaverde is the clear No. 1 -- and needed little time 
to let Olrick Johnson know it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a hot day,'' Testaverde said. ``I was frustrated  
because practice wasn't going so well. I lost my cool for a minute. 
Offensively, we didn't have our best day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, trying to break in among a talent-rich linebacking  
corps, got the message. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vinny came up to me later in the locker room and said, `Hold  
your head up,''' the rookie said. ``He said, `We're teammates. You 
protect me, too.' 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want me touching Vinny,'' Johnson added. ``Vinny's  
a vital part of this team. It wasn't a hard hit, but I touched him. 
Vinny doesn't want his hands messed with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither do the Jets.

<HEADLINE> Yaglia Wins United Nations Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Yagli, the 1-10 favorite, cruised to a  
1 1/2-length victory Saturday in the $250,000 United Nations Handicap 
at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagli, trained by Bill Mott and ridden by Jerry Bailey, stayed  
unbeaten this year with his third straight victory, racing 1 3/8 miles 
over turf in 2:16, tying a track record. 
</P>
<P>
	Supreme Sound was second and Amerique was third in the field of  
six in the inaugural running of the UN at Monmouth Park, which took 
over the race when Atlantic City allowed it to lapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagli paid $2.20, $2.10 and $2.10. Supreme Sound was worth $2.80  
and $2.10 and Amerique returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the day's other feature, the $50,000 Tyro Stakes for  
2-year-olds, Outrigger rolled to a three-length score over House 
Burner, getting 5 1/2 furlongs over a fast main track in 1:03 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey rode the winner, who paid $2.80, $2.20 and $2.10. House  
Burner returned $4 and $2.80 and Sky Legacy was worth $3.60 to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Outrigger's second win in two career starts.

<HEADLINE>  Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp's secret recordings of  
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky were meant to bring 
presidential misconduct to light, and she should be praised, not 
prosecuted, her lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury thought otherwise, indicting Mrs. Tripp on  
state wiretapping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, which followed a yearlong investigation, makes  
Mrs. Tripp the only major figure in the sex scandal to face a 
criminal charge. Each offense carries up to five years in prison 
and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp spokesman Philip Coughter called the investigation ``the  
most disgraceful, transparent campaign of politically motivated 
vengeance in recent American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's new attorney Stephen Kohn, who has handled numerous  
government whistle-blower cases, compared her to civil rights 
heroes who broke minor state laws to battle injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal law protects Mrs. Tripp as a government witness  
in a corruption case. Kohn said he will challenge the state's 
authority to bring charges because she was given immunity by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr when she turned over the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn likened the Maryland investigation to the McCarthy-era  
communist witch hunts and said Friday's indictment ``will have a 
chilling effect on witnesses who have the courage to document and 
report official misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli, who led the grand jury  
investigation, said simply, ``I think she broke the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He waved off suggestions that the case would be viewed as  
politically motivated. ``I can't help how it will be seen. ... I 
think we've done our duty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli, a Democrat appointed to his post in 1984, said he  
would handle the case himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on one count of illegal  
interception, for taping a phone conversation on Dec. 22, 1997, 
after she was told by her lawyer that secret taping was illegal. In 
conversations taped that day, the two women discussed what they 
should say about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with Clinton in 
testimony they expected to have to give for Paula Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also was charged with disclosing the contents of that  
conversation to Newsweek magazine, which published a partial 
transcript of a Tripp-Lewinsky phone call on Feb. 2, 1998. A 
spokeswoman for Newsweek, Jan Angilella, said magazine officials 
would not comment on the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and representatives of Ms. Lewinsky also  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Tripp's more than 20 hours of recordings that  
launched the independent counsel's investigation of Clinton's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings of the two women's rambling and sometimes ribald  
conversations were released publicly by the House Judiciary 
Committee before the House voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and 
obstruction. He was acquitted Feb. 12 after a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's wiretap law, which is infrequently prosecuted,  
forbids taping phone conversations without the other party's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. But Mrs. Tripp, who  
recorded the calls in her Columbia, Md., living room, testified for 
Starr's grand jury that she taped several conversations in late 
1997 even after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be allowed to arrange a time to surrender  
voluntarily, her attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, has said she began taping her friend's phone  
calls to protect herself because she was being pressured by Ms. 
Lewinsky to lie in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky confided her sexual encounters with the president  
to Mrs. Tripp after the pair became friends while working together 
at the Pentagon. Ms. Lewinsky wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge 
of the relationship in an affidavit for Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr gave Ms. Lewinsky immunity from prosecution in return for  
her testimony against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who testified in Starr's  
investigation last November, said she had urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. Mrs. Tripp also talked with her about writing a tell-all 
book about her years at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in New York, Ms. Goldberg said, ``Now she will  
be able to have her day in court and tell her side of the story.''

<HEADLINE> Killer, Victim's Kin in Same Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- The half-brother of slain Yosemite  
naturalist Joie Ruth Armstrong is being held at the same jail where 
his sister's confessed killer is in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady Schwartz, 18, is accused of stealing more than $18,000  
from his family to pay off a drug debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz's bond was raised Friday from $2,000 to $25,000, and he  
was ordered held at the Fresno County Jail, where Cary Stayner 
awaits an Aug. 6 arraignment in U.S. District Court on a murder 
charge in the July 21 death of Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who led outdoor education programs for the Yosemite  
Institute, was beheaded July 21. The 26-year-old's body was found 
the next day near her home inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner has reportedly confessed to Armstrong's murder and the  
slayings earlier this year of Carole Sund, her daughter Juli, and 
family friend Silvina Pelosso. They were last seen alive Feb. 15 at 
the Cedar Lodge where Stayner was living and working as a handyman. 
</P>
<P>
	No charges have been filed in the Sund-Pelosso murders. FBI  
agents and prosecutors are scheduled to meet Monday in Fresno to 
discuss which county will eventually prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz, who shares the same mother as Armstrong but lives with  
his father, was arrested July 18 after his father, a broker, 
discovered $3,300 in cash and $15,000 in cashier's checks missing 
from their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz, who at first denied stealing the money, told the judge  
Friday that he decided to tell the truth in the wake of his 
sister's death, saying his conscience got the best of him.

<HEADLINE> Woman Arrested in Adoption Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 21-year-old woman more than eight months  
pregnant was arrested and charged with fraud for allegedly 
promising her unborn child to seven would-be adoptive mothers for 
$16,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly Ussery, 21, pleaded innocent Friday and was held in  
lieu of $10,000 bail. Her three children were placed in the care of 
a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was devastating. I can't think of a more personal  
affront,'' said Sylvia, one of the women Ussery allegedly told had 
been chosen to be the adoptive mother. She did not want her full 
name or her husband's name made public. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old woman from West Los Angeles resident and her  
husband signed papers for the child and paid Ussery and her 
boyfriend David Roth $1,250 a month for medical expenses and rent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia became suspicious when Ussery wouldn't see a doctor. Her  
lawyer made some inquiries in the small circle of adoption 
attorneys and the scam was exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The saddest thing about it is it traffics in human emotions,''  
said Jane Gorman, an adoption lawyer in Orange County and San 
Francisco. ``Adoption for almost everybody is the end of the line 
of an almost desperate need to have a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ussery allegedly also promised her baby to five other couples  
and a single mother, all of them who paid an estimated $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	It had not been determined Saturday if the 21-year-old Roth, who  
was arrested earlier this week on an undisclosed parole violation, 
would face charges.

<HEADLINE> Police Decry Suspects' Escape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Last week, Sheriff Roy Wynn's heart broke. He saw carnage in  
Atlanta by a man long suspected of carnage in his own Cherokee 
County in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	There, six years ago, the man was linked to the hacking deaths  
of a woman and her mother. Months of police work in Alabama came to 
naught. Now, the same Mark O. Barton splattered blood in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt real saddened, all these people had lost their  
lives,'' Wynn said from Centre, Ala. ``I hoped someday we could 
bring this man to trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's case was only the latest in which it seemed police had  
their hands on a killer only to see him slip away to kill again. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year police questioned Cary Stayner in the killings  
of three Yosemite National Park sightseers. But they dismissed the 
37-year-old motel handyman as a suspect -- until he confessed to the 
July 21 beheading of a park naturalist. He later confessed to 
killing all four. 
</P>
<P>
	While the FBI and Houston police hunted Angel Maturino Resendiz  
for a string of murders, unwitting immigration agents nabbed him 
for illegally entering the country, and sent him back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Another spectacular murder case. Another spectacular blunder.  
All in a matter of weeks. Or were they blunders at all? 
</P>
<P>
	The public is getting a horrifying look at the daily frustration  
of police work, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more common than the general public knows,'' says Vernon  
Geberth, former head of Bronx homicide in the New York Police 
Department. Now a consultant, Geberth claims prosecutors are more 
reluctant today to take on cases that aren't a sure win. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people who commit murder who are walking  
the street'' because, he says, prosecutors ``don't believe they're 
able to sustain a beyond-the-reasonable-doubt scenario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reverse is also true. Every day in this country, people are  
falsely accused. ``We have three or four people let off each year 
from death row because they were wrongfully convicted,'' says Larry 
Gaines, a former officer who chairs the Criminal Justice Department 
at California State University at San Bernardino. ``Criminal 
investigation is not a precise science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fairness built into the U.S. Constitution plays a big part.  
</P>
<P>
	``Retrospectively, it's easy to say we should have done this, we  
should have done that,'' says Professor James Fyfe, a former New 
York City police lieutenant who teaches at Temple University in 
Philadelphia. Rules of evidence may frustrate cops, he says, 
``because the Constitution, very fairly, requires a whole set of 
safeguards on the criminal justice process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even in good police work, a lot can go wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	There is plain bad luck. There's also a lot of crime. A lot of  
high tech, not enough communication. More stranger-on-stranger 
murder. Turf. 
</P>
<P>
	Like everyone else, police use computers and the Internet to aid  
their work. But explains Victor Kappeler, who teaches police 
studies at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, ``the 
communication between law enforcement agencies is still very, very 
poor. It goes back, historically, to turf and jurisdiction and 
territoriality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution of three tragic cases in July draws lots of  
attention to these problems. Together, they look like a trend. But 
they're not. Some murderers get away, and not only serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Cyrano Marks. Two weeks ago in Atlanta, Marks killed  
his girlfriend, her sister and four children before turning the gun 
on himself. As it turns out, a decade ago Marks faced charges for 
murdering an airline employee. A judge threw out the case for 
insufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Richard Allen Davis. In 1993, soon after Davis abducted  
young Polly Klaas from her home in Petaluma, Calif., his car got 
stuck in a ditch. Two Sonoma County sheriff's deputies, 
investigating a trespassing report, found Davis stranded on a 
private road. They helped free him, checked for outstanding 
warrants, and sent him on his way. They didn't know about the 
kidnapping 20 miles away; the information was not broadcast on 
their radio channel. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, now on death row, later told police that when the  
deputies found him, that Polly was sitting on a hillside, alive. He 
said he killed her later. 
</P>
<P>
	Every case presents unique problems for investigators.  
</P>
<P>
	Georgia authorities say Barton shot his way through two  
stock-trading offices in Atlanta on Thursday, killing nine, 
injuring 13. Afterward, in their apartment, his wife and two 
children were found dead, beaten with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	During the rampage, it was learned that Barton was the prime  
suspect in killing his first wife and her mother. Barton denied 
this in his last note. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama authorities never did find enough hard evidence to tie  
Barton to the killings of Debra Barton and Eloise Spivey, found 
dead in 1993, inside a blood-splattered trailer at a campground. 
Investigators discovered bloody footprints by the camper door, but 
the FBI couldn't identify the brand of shoe -- a possible link to 
the killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had a possible motive: a $600,000 insurance policy on  
Mrs. Barton's life, and a girlfriend on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Wynn said state and Georgia detectives aided local  
investigators. They tracked down hundreds of campers, many from out 
of state. Barton left no impression. ``If he comes in here and acts 
normal, nobody noticed anything,'' says the Alabama sheriff. ``And 
we really couldn't find anything at the scene of the crime to 
connect him to the crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner, the suspect in the multiple murders in Yosemite, didn't  
fit the puzzle that the FBI and others pieced together in the 
February deaths of three women. Not long before Stayner's arrest, 
they were tracking a band of ex-cons, most already behind bars on 
other offenses. They were encouraged by incriminating remarks and a 
report from a crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
	Stayner is now also suspected in the unsolved death of an uncle  
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of communication also undermined the nationwide search, and  
scare, for a man dubbed the Railroad Killer. Drifter Maturino 
Resendiz surrendered last month; he is now charged in two murders 
and linked to six others. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in June, immigration agents had deported him to Mexico --  
only the most recent of a dozen encounters and deportations that 
date to 1976. But he returned, authorities believe, to kill two 
women in Texas and a family in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	The Immigration and Naturalization Service is now examining its  
own procedures.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Heat Wave at 96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As Chicago baked in 100-degree weather, thousands  
of hot and sweaty residents were forced to endure the heat without 
air conditioning or fans, due to sporadic power outages and 
brownouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hour they say it's going to be back on. Nothing,'' Anna  
Losada, who lost power in her home, said Friday. ``It's ridiculous. 
We got to pay them every month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago residents were not the only ones suffering in extreme  
heat. A wide strip of the nation, from the central states to the 
East Coast, baked for another day Friday with some temperatures 
over 100 degrees and a heat index -- the combination of heat and 
humidity -- near 120. 
</P>
<P>
	The current heat wave has been linked to at least 96 deaths  
across the country since July 19. The Midwest has been hardest hit, 
with Missouri logging 29 heat-related deaths, Illinois 23 and 10 in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll rose from 94 to 96 today.  
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, Chambers County coroner Dave Collier said today that  
Odell Walker, 84, died Friday at her home in Lafayette, Ala., the 
state's first heat-related death. Ms. Walker had air conditioning 
in her home but had not turned it on, he said. The high temperature 
in the state was 99 degrees on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the News &AMP; Observer (of Raleigh, N.C.,) reported  
that a migrant farm worker died after collapsing while working last 
week in 98-degree heat. The worker had a body temperature of 108 
degrees when he was brought to Duke University Medical Center. His 
death had not been reported earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country Friday, the heat wave was widespread and  
relentless. In Missouri, several cities recorded the 15th straight 
day of temperatures in the 90s. Nashville set a record high of 101, 
breaking the old mark set in 1954. It was 99 in Chattanooga, Tenn., 
tying the mark set in 1952. In other areas, it was 104 degrees in 
Louisville, Ky., 102 degrees in Kenosha, Wis., and 99 degrees in 
Winona, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	While some areas were due to get some relief from the heat,  
other cities braced for more of the same over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	As the temperature peaked at 104 degrees Friday at Chicago's  
Midway Airport, up to 100,000 homes and businesses began feeling 
the electricity -- along with cool stream of air conditioning -- shut 
off. Power companies blamed excessive demand for the outage. Full 
power was not expected to be restored until later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a week of temperatures that were just building up  
every day going toward 100 degrees. We're setting peak demand 
records every day,'' said Chicago's Commonwealth Edison spokesman 
Keith Bromery. ``That's put a real strain on the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While other states were able to avoid such problems, utilities  
issued warnings asking consumers to cut back on usage to prevent 
possible outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was so bad in central Arkansas that Danny Mahan, safety  
director for a construction company there, said workers pouring 
concrete have been going to work at about 3 a.m. to avoid the 
afternoon heat. He's been encouraging workers to drink plenty of 
water before they hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the younger guys think they can get a drink when it  
starts heating up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even pro athletes had trouble playing outdoors. In Chicago,  
Jimmy Connors withdrew from a seniors tennis tournament and two 
Cubs players took themselves out of a baseball game with the New 
York Mets because of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to quit. I called the trainer and said, `I can't  
take it,''' Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outages were the biggest worry in Chicago Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Several high-rise buildings with elderly were (partially)  
evacuated. Some of our cooling centers were down, and our 311 
number was overwhelmed by calls from people who couldn't get 
through to Commonwealth Edison and they wanted to report the 
outages,'' said city spokesman Terry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also made special efforts to get to the elderly, trying  
to avoid a repeat of the summer of 1995, when more than 700 elderly 
residents died in extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Police Officer Mike Sanders began the day checking to  
see how senior citizens were faring in the heat. He had to rescue 
81-year-old Mary Powls, lying on the floor of her apartment with 
her windows closed, fan off and no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders later checked on her in the hospital, where she was  
admitted in stable condition with a 104-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing that we came around when we did,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the elderly, intense heat can also be daunting for the  
homeless, if they have no shelter from the sun's rays. But in 
Louisville, Ky., which hit 106 on Friday, Bill Tracy has managed to 
find some places to keep cool during the day, such as the library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to keep myself dressed well so I can slip into  
places,'' said Tracy, who goes to a shelter at night.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to exploit Republican defections,  
President Clinton pressed GOP leaders Saturday to allow a House 
vote on legislation guaranteeing protections for managed-care 
patients before lawmakers leave next weekend for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton noted that some GOP House members, led by lawmakers who  
are also medical doctors, have joined Democrats to urge support for 
a ``patients' bill of rights'' for Americans whose health care 
plans are through health maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very good news indeed,'' he said in his weekly radio  
address. ``It means there is a bipartisan consensus emerging behind 
a bill that would give all Americans the health protections they 
need. This bill should be debated and voted on this coming week, 
before Congress adjourns for the summer. If that happens, I believe 
the bill would pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the House is brave enough to protect the American people  
over the intense lobbying of the health insurance companies, the 
Republican leadership shouldn't stand in their way,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One Republican leader, Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., said health  
care is ``too important to all Americans to act hastily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts said Republican-led House committees are working on a  
compromise, but ``there are still some key issues to resolve.'' The 
aim, he said, is to craft a bill that holds HMOs accountable and 
enables doctors to pursue the best medical treatment without 
permitting lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Clinton-Gore administration and the Democrats in  
Congress want is an issue for the 2000 election,'' Watts said. 
``Frankly, it takes longer to write a law than a campaign 
document.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed a bill that is weaker than the legislation  
the Clinton administration proposes and that almost all Capitol 
Hill Democrats support. 
</P>
<P>
	House GOP leaders had planned to bring a similar bill to the  
floor this week, but action was derailed when some GOP House 
members announced support for the Democratic version. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders contend the more sweeping Democratic plans  
would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	They advocate a more limited bill to give patients new rights of  
appeal but no right to sue if a health maintenance organization 
denies care or treatment. The GOP legislation also would give 
doctors some new power without removing an HMO's right to determine 
what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said he believes a compromise is  
possible once both chambers pass their versions of 
patient-protection legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we can have a fall dominated by bipartisan consensus  
in Congress if both sides were to put away their mirrors and blow 
away the smoke,'' Chafee said in a statement.

<P>
	Dunston, who broke out of an 0-for-24 slump with two hits  
Saturday, is batting .307 with five homers and 25 RBIs in 150 
at-bats. He cost the Mets minor league infielder Craig Paquette, 
30, who was assigned to Triple-A Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dunston serves in a multi-purpose role,'' Mets general manager  
Steve Phillips said. ``He can come off the bench and hit. We look 
for him to be a nice veteran addition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, 36, wasn't happy as he cleaned out his locker with two  
of his children. He said he didn't know if he would join the Mets, 
his sixth team in three years, right away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I found a home here, but that's how it goes,'' he  
said. ``I'm not really surprised about this. It's not like it's the 
first time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston has been a shortstop most of his career, but has also  
played some outfield the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Paquette is currently with the U.S. Pan American team. He hit a  
two-run home run Thursday in an upset of Cuba in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	In six major-league seasons, Paquette has a career .232 batting  
average with 55 homers and 195 RBIs in 426 games. In 1998 he batted 
.263 in seven games with the Mets, and in 70 games for Triple-A 
Norfolk this year he batted .272 with 15 homers and 54 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Flutie Starting QB for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- While defenders found it difficult to  
touch him, fans have had no problem getting to Buffalo Bills 
quarterback Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds after the last snap of the first session of training  
camp Saturday, Flutie found them. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed shirts, hats and helmets. He shook tiny hands. ``Whose  
pen is this?'' he said. ``Hey, what are you doing? Are you coming 
back for seconds here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove all the way from Las Vegas just to get your  
autograph,'' one man said. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl standing in the bleachers yelled ``Hey Doug!'' and  
giggled as Flutie looked up. 
</P>
<P>
	New season, same old question: Who's the Buffalo Bills' starting  
quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer is Flutie, at least for now.  
</P>
<P>
	Ever since an odd bounce and a big hit, not to mention a porous  
offensive line, sidelined starter Rob Johnson early last season, 
Flutie has been The One. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been everywhere. On cereal boxes, in Hawaii  
for the Pro Bowl, in a band with his brother Darren, at Fenway Park 
for the All-Star game's Celebrity Hitting Challenge with another 
local favorite, actor Matt Damon. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a cowboy hat when he appeared in television commercials  
for a grocery store chain, and recently he donned a cap and gown 
for commencement at Cazenovia College where 250 graduates heard his 
appeal for self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie showed Buffalo last year that a little belief in oneself  
can go a long way as he took them from 0-3 to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a winner, regardless of what anybody says about his  
height,'' receiver Andre Reed said after Flutie took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, fans love Flutie.  
</P>
<P>
	``They relate to me,'' he said. ``They feel that I'm an average  
Joe, so they can get out there and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Bills as an also-ran and earning the NFL's  
Comeback Player of the Year award from The Associated Press, Flutie 
has earned celebrity and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field he can have fun. On the field he can relax and  
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I don't rear back and gun it every time,'' Flutie said  
between double sessions, dripping sweat on a humid 95-degree day. 
``Last year I felt I had to prove myself when I was warming up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie completed 57 percent of his passes for 2,711 yards and 20  
touchdowns last year in place of Johnson, who went down with a rib 
injury in the fifth game of the season. The Bills, 6-10 in Marv 
Levy's final season, wound up 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
	After a first-round playoff loss to Miami, Flutie bitterly  
suggested he'd have to win his starting job again. 
</P>
<P>
	Even while directing the first offense as camp opened, Flutie  
shared the starting spot on the depth chart with Johnson. Johnson 
signed a $25 million contract the year before, so Flutie knows his 
$6 million bonus won't buy playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to use this camp to prepare to be the starter,'' Flutie  
said. ``I've got to perform. There's no security in this 
profession, and Rob's one hell of a quarterback.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles, McNabb Agree to 7-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- If Donovan McNabb's first week in the NFL is  
any indication, he's in for quite a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb and the Philadelphia Eagles agreed to a seven-year  
contract worth as much as $54 million with incentives Friday night, 
ending contentious negotiations that were marred by racial 
accusations by his agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement ended a tumultuous week that included missed  
practices, a damaging controversy and an ill-fated flight that 
forced the No. 2 draft pick to sit in a plane for three hours while 
waiting to fly to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	No wonder McNabb's face bore an expression of relief,  
bewilderment and exasperation when he walked into Veterans Stadium 
-- his new home -- after midnight this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited that it's done,'' McNabb said. ``It's a dream come  
true to finally be a part of an organization which I've dreamed 
about playing in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agent Fletcher Smith, whose comments about race playing a role  
stalled the negotiations, said the deal does not include voidable 
years like deals signed by top quarterbacks Tim Couch, Peyton 
Manning and Ryan Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes an $11.3 million signing bonus and incentive clauses  
that would trigger higher salaries in the final three years of the 
deal -- a similar structure to the one running back Ricky Williams 
got from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line: While McNabb's total package could be worth  
more than Couch's $48 million, seven-year deal, it guarantees 
nothing more than a minimum salary beyond the fourth year if McNabb 
doesn't play in the first three. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy with the deal,'' Smith said. ``It's an attractive  
package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb missed his fifth day of practice Friday and second day of  
full-squad workouts. The first-round draft choice is slated to back 
up starting quarterback Doug Pederson for the Eagles, who were 3-13 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb was to report to training camp at Lehigh University this  
morning, but didn't know if he'd participate in workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's something we'll talk about,'' McNabb said. ``I will be  
at practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a long, exhausting day for McNabb, who flew to Atlanta  
for a family reunion, only to learn that his contract was close to 
being finalized. His return flight was delayed three hours before 
it finally took off. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb said he hoped his holdout would not tarnish his image.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I just have to be me,'' he said. ``If I go in and  
perform the way coach Andy Reid and the rest of the staff want, I 
won't have to worry about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Reid stressed the importance of McNabb getting his  
contract resolved and reporting to camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day, every practice, every rep he is missing, you can't  
get those back,'' Reid said. ``There's no price that you can put on 
those. Donovan needs to be here, and we want him here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations ceased for two days this week after Smith's  
comments about race playing a role in the talks aired on a cable 
television show. Smith cited white quarterbacks who got voidable 
contracts and a black quarterback, Steve McNair, who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	But the talks were salvaged when Smith, who is based in Chicago  
and has dealings with former NBA superstar Michael Jordan, flew to 
Philadelphia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt it would be more constructive if we worked face to  
face, rather than on the phone where there can be distractions,'' 
Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Banner acknowledged that the controversy affected the  
negotiations, both sides said they thought it was over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given that the statement came out of my mouth, I never really  
felt that race was an issue to begin with,'' Smith said. ``It 
didn't interfere with the discussions, especially over the past two 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the contract includes 8-10 incentives. If any  
incentive is reached in any of the first three seasons, the 
escalated salaries in the final three years kick in. He named three 
of the incentives: 1,601 passing yards, 30 touchdowns and a 100 
quarterback rating. 
</P>
<P>
	If the escalators kick in, Smith said McNabb's salary would be  
``about 5 percent more'' than Couch's in the final three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Andre Reed, who threatened to retire if Buffalo didn't pay him  
more, is on his way to training camp with a possible agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed reportedly agreed to a one-year extension through the 2001  
season. General manager John Butler confirmed Reed would be in 
camp, but would not say if there is an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, the Bills' leading career receiver, plans to report  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Packers    	
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre and wide receiver Antonio  
Freeman missed the first day of camp for veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	Favre is with his wife and newborn daughter, but was expected to  
join the team today. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeman, an unrestricted free agent before the Packers  
designated him their franchise player, is still working out terms 
of a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	New England agreed to contracts with their remaining two draft  
picks, first-rounders Damien Woody and Andy Katzenmoyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody, taken with the 17th pick of the draft, agreed to a  
contract estimated at $1.25 million a year for five years with a 
$3.85 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the Patriots under the salary cap by $835,000 a year,  
but there was no confirmation that Katzenmoyer, the Ohio State 
linebacker chosen with the 28th pick, received that as part of a 
four-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay's Chidi Ahanotu became one of the NFL's highest-paid  
defensive ends when he signed a six-year contract worth about $5 
million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal included a signing bonus of more than $5 million.  
</P>
<P>
                             *Vikings    	
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota signed quarterback Daunte Culpepper, the team's  
first-round draft choice out of Central Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Culpepper, expected to back up Randall Cunningham, will join his  
new teammates at Vikings training camp in Mankato, Minn., next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of his contract were not released, but WCCO-TV reported  
Culpepper signed a five-year contract worth about $2 million a year 
with a $5 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Cowboys    	
</P>
<P>
	Dallas right guard Mike Kiselak, playing with the first team  
because of two other injuries, seriously damaged his left knee and 
defensive end Kavika Pittman broke several small bones in his right 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI was inconclusive, and Kiselak is scheduled to undergo  
arthroscopic surgery Tuesday in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittman should be able to practice with a cast in 2-4 weeks.  
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Hours after offensive tackle Jamain Stephens couldn't complete a  
series of 40-yard runs on a 94-degree day, Pittsburgh cut the 1996 
first-round draft choice, who started 10 games at right tackle last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers also got a jolt when Jerome Bettis, who has rushed  
for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last three seasons, 
reported to camp with an undisclosed left knee injury. He was 
injured 10 days ago while working with track coach Bob Kersee in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis is expected to be ready for the Sept. 12 opener against  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	Arizona cut tight end Chris Gedney, who underwent surgery to  
remove his colon July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Gedney said he was shocked by the team's move because he was  
counting on the team's support as he underwent further surgery and 
mounted a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals general manager Bob Ferguson said Gedney, the leading  
pass catcher among Cardinals tight ends the last two seasons, was 
waived because he failed his physical. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	A contract stalemate kept Miami tackle Richmond Webb from  
reporting to training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, is unsigned and  
negotiating a long-term deal. He declined a one-year tender of 
$3.369 million when the Dolphins designated him their franchise 
player in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Webb, 32, has been a starting tackle since his rookie season in  
1990. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	The day after rookies and a few veterans showed up to camp, the  
remaining members of the Seattle Seahawks reported -- with the 
exception of wide receiver Joey Galloway and rookie defensive 
lineman Lamar King. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway is seeking a sizable raise from the $1.6 million he is  
scheduled to receive this season in the final year of his current 
contract, The Spokesman-Review of Spokane reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks have reportedly offered Galloway a five-year deal  
worth around $22 million, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	King is seeking a deal somewhere between the contracts signed by  
the No. 20 and No. 24 picks in the draft, also defensive linemen.

<HEADLINE> Sears To Cut 680 Jobs by October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. will trim  
about 680 jobs from its corporate headquarters by the end of 
October, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will affect 10 percent of the company's headquarters  
staff in addition to hundreds of independent contractors who will 
be let go by Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``By year-end, we will have a leaner organization,'' said Sears  
spokesman Ron Culp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears has been under increasing market pressure from  
lower-priced competitors, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's same-store sales have increased only 1 percent to  
2 percent during each of the past several months and second-quarter 
profits fell 1.5 percent to $331 million, Sears reported last week.

<HEADLINE> NASA Upgrades Space Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT IRWIN, Calif. (AP) -- Enormous bowl-shaped antennas point  
into the desert sky nonstop every day, beaming commands or 
collecting data and images from unmanned spacecraft millions of 
miles from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures from Mars. Directions to Saturn. An analysis of  
Jupiter's clouds. NASA's Deep Space Network, this planet's link to 
two dozen probes scattered throughout the solar system and beyond, 
is busier than ever. Perhaps too busy. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we look at the overall capacity of the network, we  
invariably have about 20 to 50 percent more requirements than we 
have the capacity,'' said Gene Burke, who oversees network 
scheduling at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's crunch is expected to be dwarfed by future demands as  
the space agency plans to launch 27 more missions by 2008. In an 
era of tight dollars, researchers are looking for ways to expand 
the overbooked system without losing a pricey probe or busting the 
budget with more $35 million antennas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to do it less expensively yet return even more  
exciting results,'' said Marc Rayman, deputy mission manager of the 
Deep Space 1 spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	The network stations, spread around the Earth so spacecraft can  
be tracked continuously, can detect signals at the edge of the 
solar system from a transmitter no more powerful than a light bulb. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to ease pressure on the network is to make spacecraft  
more self-sufficient. The Voyager probes launched in 1977 required 
daily contact with ground controllers. Cassini, which is now on its 
way to Saturn, normally needs only weekly contact. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deep Space 1 probe, launched in October, tested automatic  
navigation and artificial intelligence software. Both technologies 
could make future spacecraft less reliant on orders from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers also are exploring ways to expand the network's  
capacity by packing more information into the signals. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 included a radio that can transmit at a higher  
frequency than most of today's probes. The frequency, called Ka 
band, is expected to speed up communications by four fold over 
current transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the research into expanding the network's capacity with  
Ka band is taking place at the Goldstone tracking station in 
California's Mojave Desert, where the antennas stand like massive 
exotic desert flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The remote location shields the station from Earth-based radio  
interference, but the desert heat and wind also make it more 
difficult to point the antennas, which range from 36 feet to 230 
feet in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstone researchers are developing a system that would  
automatically adjust the antennas depending on wind speeds and 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a capacity crunch, NASA has yet to lose a mission  
because of problems with the network, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that massive amount of steel just has to move to an  
intricate level of detail when you talk about a spacecraft being 
out there,'' he said. ``It's a really immense task.''

<HEADLINE> Risks Lure and Repel Day Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stock market day traders are warned by firms  
of the enormous stress they will face and the risk of being 
financially wiped out. But they're also told they can be their own 
bosses and strike it rich. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators, who have cracked down on a number of  
day-trading firms for alleged abuses, said Friday the majority of 
those investigated have overblown the potential profits and played 
down the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	And some psychology experts said the anxiety generated by  
intense, volatile day trading of stocks by computer can lead the 
players to take their frustrations out on their families and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, who shot and killed nine people at two  
day-trading firms in Atlanta on Thursday, was one of a band of 
about 5,000 investors around the country who trade full-time, 
paying the firms that host them a commission for each trade. These 
players ride the tiniest ups and downs of the stock markets, 
squeezing profits by rapidly buying and selling shares 
electronically. Thousands of dollars of their own money are on the 
line, requiring nerves of steel and the ability to make snap 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The day traders, many of whom have abandoned their regular jobs,  
are distinct from the 5 million or so amateur investors who 
occasionally trade on the Internet at home or at work. 
</P>
<P>
	For day traders, the market IS their work -- every day, from  
opening bell to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading firms, sometimes in response to pressure from  
securities regulators, warn potential customers of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site of All-Tech Investment Group Inc., a company where  
Barton traded, carries this statement: ``Warning: Active electronic 
stock trading is risky. Participants should be aware of, and 
capable of assuming the inherent risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wolff, owner of Equity Trading, a day-trading firm on  
the sixth floor of New York's Empire State Building, said the 
company managers use weekly seminars to inform investors of risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stress that this business is not for everybody,'' Wolff  
said. ``You could potentially lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some firms lure prospective day traders with aggressive  
advertising promising instant wealth and the opportunity to break 
free from a traditional job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are boundless opportunities,'' James H. Lee, chairman  
and president of the Electronic Traders Association, said in an 
interview earlier this year. ``There's a great deal of success in 
the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Beauchamp, a spokesman for the North American Securities  
Administrators Association, said most day traders lose money. Most 
firms that have run into trouble ``have misled customers by 
exaggerating the potential profits of day trading and downplaying 
the risks of losses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last fall, Massachusetts has filed or settled complaints  
against seven firms. One firm promised a ``six- to seven-figure 
income per year,'' said securities regulators. Another said 85 
percent of its customers succeeded. In Texas, authorities closed 
two firms accused of operating without state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush for stock market gold can create extreme anxiety, in  
the view of some behavioral experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very high-pressure situation. ... I've seen people hit  
the wrong (computer) key out of anxiety'' while day trading, said 
Steven Hendlin, a clinical psychologist in Irvine, Calif. ``There's 
a lot of coffee drinking, a lot of squirming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exasperation of a day of market losses can make a trader  
irritable around family and friends or make the person withdraw, 
said Hendlin, who is writing a book on day trading. ``A guy may 
blame his wife and not even be consciously aware of the cause of 
his anger,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp swings between gains and losses ``have emotional  
consequences. ... It can be all-consuming for people,'' said Dr. 
Jeffrey Kahn, a New York psychiatrist who is the president of 
WorkPsych Associates, a corporate mental health consulting firm. 
``There may be problem traders who are not too different from 
problem gamblers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidental to the shootings, the National Association of  
Securities Dealers, which governs the Nasdaq Stock Market, approved 
a rule Thursday requiring firms that promote day trading to 
disclose the risks to customers -- before they open accounts.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Puzzled by Drug's Underuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	So maybe they really should put statin drugs in the water supply  
as some heart doctors only half-jokingly suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The put-it-in-the-water quip inevitably surfaces, it seems,  
whenever heart specialists gather to talk pills. It echoes both 
their confidence in statins' power to lower cholesterol and their 
frustration that millions miss out. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is it, they wonder, that despite nonstop haranguing by the  
country's top heart gurus and saturation advertising by drug 
makers, these safe, lifesaving medicines are so underused? 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly everyone who studies cholesterol for a living seems to  
agree that statin drugs should be taken by many more people. 
Statins are one of the true medical breakthroughs of recent times. 
They spectacularly reduce cholesterol, and they do it far better 
than even the most draconian diet and exercise programs. A 60-point 
drop in cholesterol is nothing special on statins. 
</P>
<P>
	Their effects on health are equally impressive. Statins keep  
arteries from clogging up and may even reverse the process. People 
on statins lower their risk of heart attacks by about one-third. 
They need fewer angioplasty and bypass operations. And they live 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the drugs are easy to take, and side effects are  
rare. Clearly, this is medicine that works. Yet statins are not 
being pumped into the water supply, not even close. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8 million Americans now take them. But in the opinion of  
many of the country's heart disease elite, perhaps 20 million, even 
30 million, should be on statins. As a result, heart disease, the 
country's No. 1 killer, will take many more than it should. 
</P>
<P>
	Statin drugs ``have had the greatest impact of anything I've  
seen over the past three decades,'' says Dr. Antonio Gotto, a 
cardiologist and dean of the Cornell University medical school. 
``With wider application, they have the potential of making a 
tremendous dent in death and disability from coronary disease. 
We've only started to scratch the surface of that potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why is that? Many say it boils down to the simplest of  
shortcomings: Doctors fail to offer statins to people who need 
them; people who need them fail to take them. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the obvious is a complex web of problems and  
uncertainties, and experts say no single thread tells the whole 
story. For instance, at $100 a month, price alone keeps many off 
the drug, and that's just the start. Some doctors are too out of 
touch or overworked to write the prescriptions. Some patients are 
too pill-phobic to take them. And then there's the fact that the 
medical system often emphasizes treating disease rather than 
preventing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Five brands are available: Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Lescol,  
Mevacor and Baycol. They are called statins because their generic 
names, such as lovastatin and atorvastatin, all end the same way. 
The first of these drugs came on the market a decade ago, but the 
evidence of their worth amassed slowly, much of it over the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs differ in potency but basically work the same way. All  
inhibit a protein called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A 
reductase, which is necessary for the liver to make cholesterol. 
When statins first came into use, many doctors were leery they 
might cause liver damage. But over time this has proven to be 
highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 1 percent of statins users have possible liver  
abnormalities, as measured by a blood enzyme test given a few weeks 
after treatment starts. The problem is reversible if they quit the 
medicine or possibly switch brands. In one big study, abnormal 
liver enzymes turned out to be just as common among people on dummy 
pills as those taking statins. Whatever the connection, serious 
liver damage from statins has proven to be exceedingly rare. 
</P>
<P>
	As prescription drugs go, statins are unusually free of risks.  
``Ten milligrams of statins is probably as safe as two aspirins,'' 
says Dr. Richard Pasternak of Massachusetts General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also were dubious at first because they had no proof  
that lowering cholesterol with statins actually saves lives. But 
this, too, has changed with a series of landmark mega-studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, which  
tested Zocor on people with both obvious heart disease and high 
cholesterol. Their risk of dying during five years on the medicine 
was about 30 percent lower than expected. Since cardiovascular 
disease kills nearly 1 million Americans annually, the implications 
-- both for preventing deaths and selling drugs -- were obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	To see who else might benefit, four other big studies have since  
looked at statins' effects on folks with healthier hearts and less 
ominous cholesterol levels. The results are remarkably consistent. 
On statins, the risk of dying, of having a heart attack or of 
needing a bypass or angioplasty are between 25 percent and 33 
percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Committees of medical experts sometimes meet to help front-line  
doctors make sense of new medical evidence like this. The last time 
this happened for statin drugs was in 1993, when the federal 
government's National Cholesterol Education Program drew up 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before the big studies came out, but even then the  
committee felt the evidence was clear that people with heart 
disease should get statins -- along with sensible diets -- if their 
cholesterol levels are modestly elevated. It set the cutoff for 
cholesterol levels higher for those with no signs of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the committee will meet again to update these  
recommendations, and it almost certainly will lower the threshold 
for statin use. Still, Dr. James Cleeman, the education program's 
head, estimates that under the 1993 standards, about 12 million or 
13 million Americans should be taking statins -- or 50 percent more 
than are now. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts believe statins should be offered to at least twice  
as many people as the 1993 government standards suggest. At some 
elite medical centers, doctors ignore the guidelines and put 
virtually all heart attack victims on statins, no matter what their 
cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're adopting the philosophy that your cholesterol is too  
high for you if you've had a cardiac event,'' says Dr. Shelley 
Shapiro of the University of Southern California. ``We're starting 
it right in the ICU. They go home with statins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is little question among the experts that statins should  
be front-line therapy for what they call secondary prevention -- 
keeping victims of heart attacks and angina pain from getting 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data in secondary prevention are overwhelming,'' says Dr.  
John A. Ambrose of Saint Vincents Hospital in New York City. ``You 
can't even get people to argue about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet doctors estimate that the drugs are prescribed by only 20  
percent of those diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some disagreement about what doctors call primary  
prevention -- giving statins to those who have no outward signs of 
heart trouble. But even here, evidence is building that outwardly 
healthy people with only mildly elevated cholesterol will live 
longer and better if they take statins. 
</P>
<P>
	The most persuasive evidence comes from Gotto's study of about  
6,000 middle-aged men and women. Their total cholesterol readings 
averaged around 220, somewhat higher than ideal but typical for 
American adults, while their HDL, the variety of cholesterol that 
protects against heart attacks, was considered to be a bit low. On 
statins, their risk of first-time heart attacks and serious chest 
pain fell by about one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, these results mean that many more healthy Americans  
should be on statins, even if their cholesterol levels seem normal. 
Indeed, only 17 percent of the people in Gotto's study would be 
considered candidates for taking statins under the 1993 guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules discourage statins for healthy people unless their  
levels of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol are at least 160. The 
biggest controversy among statins advocates is how low this number 
should fall. Some say 100 is a reasonable cutoff. Others push for 
even more aggressive cholesterol lowering. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at more primitive societies, it's not uncommon to  
see adult males with LDLs less than 80,'' says Dr. Steven Nissen of 
the Cleveland Clinic, a member of the lower-is-better camp. ``We 
have simply set the standard too high. We've got to get LDL down to 
60 to 80 and total cholesterol under 150. I think we'll find if we 
do that, we will literally stop this disease in its tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statins studies are underway to see if Nissen is right. No  
matter what the results, however, some doctors are likely to balk 
at putting perfectly healthy people on cholesterol drugs for life. 
This is because most won't benefit in the short run. In Gotto's 
study, 55 people had to take statins for five years to prevent one 
heart attack or angina onset. 
</P>
<P>
	However, doctors have many less-thought-out reasons, too, for  
ignoring statins. One is that many primary care doctors simply do 
not know much about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if statins have been out there for 10 years. Lots  
of specialties are not good at incorporating new ideas into 
practice, and generalists tend to be slower,'' says Dr. Theodore 
Ganiats of the University of California-San Diego, who represents 
primary care doctors on the National Cholesterol Education Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reasons:  
</P>
<P>
	--Many doctors feel that in a 10-minute office visit, they can  
convince patients to make only one or two changes. If a potbellied 
50-year-old smoker has high blood pressure and borderline diabetes, 
cholesterol may not seem like the most important thing to talk 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some doctors may not want the extra work involved in persuading  
patients to take statins, making sure they have follow-up liver 
tests, checking their cholesterol counts, scaling up the doses as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Physicians tend to be a real show-me group that changes  
slowly and gets on the bandwagon slowly,'' says Dr. Calvin 
Weisberger, a Kaiser Permanente cardiologist in Los Angeles. Many 
probably remain skeptical of the benefits of statins, no matter 
what they've heard. 
</P>
<P>
	--Statins typically cost between $70 and $100 a month. This is  
likely to seem especially steep, considering that the drugs 
typically don't make people feel better. But prices are likely to 
fall in the next two to three years as the drugs lose patent 
protection and cheaper generics appear. Drug companies might even 
ask approval to sell them without prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some people shun statins because they ``overestimate how much  
personal control they have over their cholesterol,'' says Dr. Margo 
Denke of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Most 
cannot bring seriously high cholesterol down enough with diet 
alone. That approach typically can lower cholesterol by only about 
5 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some patients are not told, or don't understand, that they have  
to use statins for the rest of their lives, not just until their 
cholesterol falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical shortcomings have a way of healing themselves over time,  
and underuse of statins is likely to do the same. Experts estimate 
that statin prescriptions rose by almost one-third last year. And 
some doctors say the aversion to prescribing statins and taking 
them appears to be easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Hauser of William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak,  
Mich. has little doubt what this will mean. ``The statins, more 
than any other drug in the last decade, offer the promise for 
patients at risk of coronary artery disease to live a full life 
free of angina, heart attacks and premature death,'' he says. ``I 
have no idea what the reluctance is, personally. The evidence is so 
overwhelming.''

<HEADLINE> Deals Shape Up As Deadline Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kevin Appier, Billy Taylor and Jim Leyritz switched teams, and  
several other deals -- but none involving Chuck Finley -- seemed 
possible Saturday as baseball approached the midnight EDT trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The busy Oakland Athletics shuffled their staff, bracing for a  
wild-card run. They got Appier from the Kansas City Royals and also 
sent Taylor to the New York Mets for Jason Isringhausen and Greg 
McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in a step-on-the-gas mode,'' Appier said. ``They think  
they've got a good thing going and they're trying to improve their 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, meanwhile, made a five-player swap with Colorado,  
obtaining outfielder Darryl Hamilton and reliever Chuck McElroy for 
outfielder Brian McRae and two minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also moving to New York -- again -- was Leyritz. The Yankees  
reacquired the postseason hero from the San Diego Padres for a 
minor league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Guzman and Roberto Hernandez were among the top players  
most likely to move later as contenders looked for pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades can still be made after the deadline, but players must  
first pass through waivers. That means any club can step in and 
block a potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no deal for Finley. Though the Yankees showed  
interest, the Cleveland Indians were believed to have pursued the 
Anaheim ace the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chuck Finley is still on the Angels,'' general manager Bill  
Bavasi said. ``We did not shop around, it came down to one club. We 
gave them a group of players we would take and it stayed there. 
They called and said they did not accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, 31, had been rumored in possible deals since spring  
training. The right-hander was 9-9 with a 4.87 ERA, and 114-89 in a 
career that began with the Royals in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad, but I'm not saying that I hate Kansas City or the  
fans,'' Appier said. ``I'm going to miss them and it's not like I'm 
going to leave the city. We're going to continue to live there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland traded three young pitchers for Appier: Blake Stein,  
Jeff D'Amico and Brad Rigby. The Athletics, 3 1/2 games behind Toronto 
in the wild-card race, also sent away the 37-year-old Taylor, who 
has 26 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate Kevin's long and loyal service,'' Royals general  
manager Herk Robinson said. ``However, the Royals organization has 
made a commitment to reducing payroll and taking advantage of 
signing the numerous picks we had in this June's amateur draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics recently traded pitcher Kenny Rogers to the Mets  
and also got pitcher Omar Olivares and infielder Randy Velarde from 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we made all these deals, we had a grand plan in mind,''  
Athletics general manager Billy Beane said. ``One had to fall in 
order for the other to fall. This is a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to add to the present and future with every deal we  
did. Kevin has been a No. 1 and he brings a No. 1 mentality. 
There's a lot of value in that,'' he said. ``We weren't supposed to 
be here in July. Now we're trying to make our mark in this race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been talk the AL East-leading Yankees would send  
struggling starter Andy Pettitte to Philadelphia, but manager Joe 
Torre said before Saturday's game at Boston, ``I don't think it's 
going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Yankees completed a deal for Leyritz.  
</P>
<P>
	``They could have traded me anywhere, but it shows the class of  
this organization to give me another opportunity back in New 
York,'' Leyritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in New York for as many years as I did, it's almost  
like being in the World Series every day. I thrived on it while I 
was there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz, 35, is hitting .239 with eight home runs and 21 RBIs.  
He can play first base or DH, and was Pettitte's personal catcher 
with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres got minor league pitcher Geraldo Padua for Leyritz.  
The 22-year-old righty was 9-4 with a 2.86 ERA for Class A 
Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado and the Mets swapped center fielders and left-handed  
relievers. The Rockies also got pitcher Rigo Beltran and minor 
league outfielder Thomas Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 34, was batting .303 with four homers and 24 RBIs.  
McElroy, 31, was 3-1 with a 6.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planned to join the Mets on Sunday in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised, but a little relieved that it's  
over,'' Hamilton said. ``I gained about 25 games in a five-minute 
phone call. That makes it a little more interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, 31, has been a disappointment with the Mets, batting .221  
with eight homers and 36 RBIs. Beltran, 29, was optioned to 
Triple-A Norfolk July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darryl's hitting over .300 right now and we think he's going  
to improve us offensively and defensively,'' Mets general manager 
Steve Phillips said. ``Unfortunately, Brian couldn't get anything 
going this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in a swap of 25-year-old minor league pitchers, the Florida  
Marlins sent Brandon Villafuerte to the Detroit Tigers for Mike 
Drumright.

<HEADLINE> Giants Give Toomer a $11M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Amani Toomer, whose last-minute touchdown  
catch knocked the Denver Broncos from the undefeated ranks last 
season, has signed a new four-year, $11.2 million contract with the 
New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-year wide receiver received a $3.5 million signing  
bonus under terms of the deal signed late Friday. He will earn 
$350,000 in salary this season, $1.2 million in 2000, with the 
remaining $6.1 million divided over the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	An unrestricted free agent who finally showed signs of promise  
last year, Toomer had signed a tender offer for $429,000 in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of us who saw him liked him a lot,'' general manager  
Ernie Accorsi said Saturday. ``He's big, he's got excellent hands, 
can run, and he made a lot of big plays for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None was better than the 37-yard, leaping reception of a pass  
from Kent Graham in the back of the end zone with 48 seconds to 
play. It gave New York a 20-16 win over the two-time defending 
Super Bowl champion Broncos, highlighting a stretch in which the 
Giants won five of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was all I pretty much heard from all my friends, my  
family, everybody I knew back when I was little, who called me 
up,'' Toomer said.

<HEADLINE> Rookie Says He Loves Dover Downs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- It was hot -- just about 100 degrees -- so  
perhaps the thought process of Indy Racing League rookie Scott 
Harrington was warped by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this place,'' Harrington said of Dover Downs  
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not a sentiment often expressed about The Monster Mile.  
The high-banked concrete oval long ago earned its nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, IRL ace Eddie Cheever says Dover is just as difficult  
as the street course in Monte Carlo, a layout Formula One drivers 
contend is the most physically demanding in the world. Cheever once 
raced in F1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been out of the top 10 in any practice session,''  
Harrington said Saturday after a qualifying run of 180.415 mph put 
him fifth on the grid for Sunday's MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200. ``The car 
is comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Harrington, whose Aurora-powered Dallara gave him the best  
starting spot of his career, isn't figuring his first race at Dover 
will be easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Staying out of trouble,'' he said when quizzed on his race day  
battle plan. ``This is a fast place, and things happen very quickly 
around here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to qualify well, but staying out of trouble is  
the key.''

	 *HAIR-RAISING TALE:* Jeff Ward, hoping the MBNA Mid-Atlantic 200  
will result in the first victory of his three-year IRL career, will 
do just about anything to get it. So would some of the crewmen on 
his Yahoo! Pagan Racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Sheets, Brad Brewer and Rusty Shelden have dyed their hair  
blond in a superstitious attempt to end the drought at 0-for-20. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd dye my hair purple if I thought it would bring us our  
first win,'' said Sheets, the team's left rear tire changer. ``The 
blond hair deal is just a team unity thing right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They won't have to worry about hue or tint should Ward -- four  
times a second-place finisher -- prevail Sunday. At that point, the 
crew members will head for the barbershop to have their heads 
shaved. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GROOM TO BE:* After riding the high banks of Dover on Sunday,  
Stephan Gregoire will fly off to matrimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been planning to get married for some time now, but  
with my schedule it was difficult to find the right time,'' said 
the 30-year-old Frenchman, who will marry Virginie Houot. ``We are 
going to France directly after this race,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gregoire will return in time to drive for Dick Simon Racing in  
the next IRL event, the Colorado 200 on Aug. 28 at Pikes Peak 
International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	``With luck, my last race as a bachelor will bring us a great  
result,'' said Gregoire, whose best career finish was second at 
Pikes Peak in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PIT STOPS:* Dover Downs officials, in the second year of their  
three-year contract with the IRL, are hoping for a larger crowd 
than they had last July for the inaugural race. But excruciating 
heat probably will hold down the walkup crowd. Last year, about 
25,000 saw the first open-wheel race at the track since 1969. ... 
The facility, which held 107,000 in 1998, has 15,000 additional 
seats this year. ... Drivers learned the true meaning of the 
track's nickname -- The Monster Mile -- when only 10 of 22 starters 
were running at the end last year. ... The race, slowed by seven 
cautions for 99 of 248 laps in 1998 -- limiting Scott Sharp's 
winning average speed to 93.318 mph -- has been reduced to 200 laps 
this year. ... Only Sharp and Buddy Lazier were on the lead lap 
when the crash-filled race ended in 1998. ... Vegas.com, which has 
among its media holdings the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, will sponsor 
the IRL race Sept. 26 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The event will 
be known as the vegas.com 500.

<HEADLINE> 'Radar' Makes Comeback After Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dropping of the radar screen cost Gary Burghoff,  
best known for his portrayal of ``Radar'' in ``M A S H,'' a good 
deal of cash over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Burghoff told the Aug. 9 edition of People that his decision to  
turn down acting roles after his seven year stint on the popular 
series reduced his income sharply, and he was forced to file for 
bankruptcy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was down to my last $500,'' the 56-year-old said. ``The  
money ran out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the actor is in financial shape these days. He sells his  
canvas drawings of wildlife for $25,000 each; he is acting on stage 
again, and is soon to appear in the 120-city tour of Neil Simon's 
``The Last of the Red Hot Lovers''; and is the new host of the 
public television series, ``Pets: Part of the Family.''

<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was no time to be sick.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Humbert's ear was so infected when the Pan American Games  
water polo competition began, he missed the first two matches in 
the Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired, his head aching, his chest congested, his ear shut,  
Humbert and several ailing teammates set up a sick bay where they 
rested between matches. Their bodies were suffering, but their game 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Humbert scored five goals Friday night as the  
United States beat Cuba 11-7 to claim the gold medal and earn a 
trip to the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to the pool and my temperature was 101,'' Humbert said.  
``This week hasn't been a lot of fun. We had to quarantine all the 
sick guys. We've come through some adversity, and this feels 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humbert's offense was a big part of the Americans' commanding  
victory over a Cuban team they beat just 6-4 when their lanky 
two-meter man couldn't play early in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sparking the United States was the defense and  
length-of-the-pool passing of goalie Daniel Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Oeding and Humbert got behind the Cuban defense and  
took long passes from Hackett for easy scores within 40 seconds of 
one another to open the second period and make it 4-1. The United 
States led 6-2 at the half and 10-3 after three periods, using 
their superior swimming ability and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could throw one any better than the one to  
Chris,'' Hackett said. ``You're always confident he will finish any 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game was just a test because half our guys have the flu,  
including Chris. He couldn't even practice all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's basketball team looked like a group that hasn't  
spent much time together, which is precisely the case, but still 
won its opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserves Michelle Marciniak and Amy Herrig gave Team USA the  
spark it needed to get past Argentina 63-55. Marciniak got the 
Americans going with two length-of-the-court drives for baskets, 
and Herrig had 15 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States isn't using a top team in the Pan Am Games,  
and the players didn't start practicing until July 17. The lack of 
time together was evident as coach Nell Fortner substituted 
constantly looking for the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can practice all you want, but the real experience comes  
from playing games with refs, scorekeepers, fans and everything 
else,'' Marciniak said. ``There's no substitute for that. We 
learned more tonight than from all the practices going against each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men open tonight against Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. pitcher Michele Smith almost duplicated teammate Danielle  
Henderson's perfect game in Thursday's softball opener. Smith was 
perfect through six innings before yielding a hit in a 5-0 victory 
over Netherlands Antilles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans dominated the final night of track and field by winning  
five of the 10 events, including a fourth straight Pan Ams gold by 
high jumper Javier Sotomayor. Sotomayor took only two jumps, 
clearing 7 feet, 2 1/2 inches and 7-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Also winning for Cuba was Anier Garcia, who ran the 110-meter  
hurdles in 13.17 seconds to break one of the meet's oldest records, 
13.20 by Renaldo Nehemiah in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba finished track and field with 11 gold medals. That was one  
more than the United States, which was shut out in the relays and 
failed to win a gold Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tremendous,'' said Jose Salmeron, spokesman for the  
Cuban team. ``We did it with spectacular marks and in spite of not 
having as many key athletes as in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also suffered disappointments in field hockey and  
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Any chances for the United States to qualify for the Olympics in  
men's field hockey ended with a 4-1 loss to Argentina. The men's 
volleyball team fell out of medal contention when it lost to 
Venezuela 25-21, 28-26, 25-22. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in the games, the U.S. women's volleyball  
team was swept by Cuba, but the Americans could still win the 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better for the United States in the ring on the  
opening night of boxing. Flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles beat 
Carlos Valcarcel of Puerto Rico in the new format of four 
two-minute rounds. Welterweight LeChaunce Shepherd of Milwaukee, 
Wis., stopped Nicaragua's Isaac Caballero in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won the premier rowing event, the men's eight with  
cox. The U.S. team took control at 500 meters and won by nearly 
three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, an official from the International Baseball  
Association told several reporters that two Cuban baseball players 
had defected. But Canadian immigration officials and sources close 
to the Cuban team said the official was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the players mentioned by IBA delegate Enzo Gesu was  
pitcher Jose Ibar. But he was in the dugout today when Cuba 
advanced to the semifinals by beating the Dominican Republic 3-1.

<HEADLINE> Heat the Arbiter of Life in Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUN CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Long before our grandparents were born,  
the Sun God smiled upon the land. And there was warmth. 
</P>
<P>
	Trouble was, the Sun God didn't know when to stop smiling. So  
there was more warmth -- 300 sunny days a year, so many that they 
named this place the Valley of the Sun. By this time the Sun God 
was grinning like a butcher's dog. Like a dental ad. Like an 
Osmond. 
</P>
<P>
	And from the desert rose a wondrous civilization called the  
Phoenix Metropolitan Area. But the asphalt and glass only made it 
more torrid. And people wondered if the Sun God was one of those 
demons from the hot place down below. 
</P>
<P>
	Just how hot was it? Birds burrowed into cactuses to stay cool.  
Drivers clutched potholders while steering. People rose at 4 a.m. 
to mow and garden and golf, then retreated from the searing morning 
before 9. ``Are you getting enough shade?'' became a pleasantry. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally they found a tool that could keep the blistering deity  
at bay -- but only indoors. There came to be two distinct realms in 
the valley. Outside the Sun God still prevailed, smiling that 
infernal smile. But inside, at last it was cool. 
</P>
<P>
	They called their tool air conditioning; by the tens of  
thousands, they put it to use. It changed the Valley of the Sun 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	On the Loop 101 Freeway, just northwest of downtown Phoenix,  
it's rush hour. But less than a mile away from the corridor of 
climate-controlled cars, the streets of suburban Sun City on this 
bright summer morning are utterly, surreally empty of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody on the sidewalks of Del Webb Boulevard, named after the  
guy who laid out Sun City. Not a posterior planted on any of the 55 
outdoor public benches at Lakeview Center. And in the neighborhoods 
where so much of the nation comes to retire, same story. The lawns 
of Tropicana Circle -- not a soul. The fairways of Lakes West Golf 
Course -- deserted. 
</P>
<P>
	It was different at 4:30 a.m. Before dawn, walkers crowded the  
streets, gardeners the lawns, golfers the links. In the middle of 
what other people consider the night, Sun City was alive. 
Understandably so: It was only about 95 degrees. And dark. 
</P>
<P>
	But by 9 a.m. it's 108 degrees, heading to a 116-degree high.  
And Sun City, like most of the rest of metro Phoenix, is indoors 
with its indispensable accessories -- air conditioners and 
evaporative ``swamp coolers,'' contraptions that cool the air by 
making it moist and work only in low humidity. 
</P>
<P>
	``People simply wouldn't live here if they didn't have the tools  
to keep them cool,'' says Ivy Wixson, manager of Sun City's Olive 
Branch Recreation Center, a senior center where a sign in the lobby 
advertises an upcoming ``indoor picnic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From June to August, this is how metropolitan Phoenix exists -- a  
flurry of mad dashes from air-conditioned home to air-conditioned 
car to air-conditioned office to air-conditioned mall. Determined 
15-minute searches for shady parking spots. And rising 
thermometers: Phoenix's normal high temperature in July is 106 
degrees -- the highest of any major American city. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, what do you expect when you build a city smack in the  
middle of the Sonoran Desert? Of course the heat -- face-slapping, 
shirt-drenching, foot-blistering, sear-your-elbow-on-the-pay-phone 
heat -- is the arbiter of lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody understands what it's like to get ready for  
winter,'' says Jim Belnap, owner of a 44-year-old air-conditioning 
installation and service company called George Brazil. ``Here, we 
spend our time getting ready for summer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How hot is it? Hotter than where you are. Car manufacturers use  
Phoenix to test the endurance of their paint. Saudi Arabian 
hospitals recruit foreign staff from here so they get people who 
are accustomed to the heat. A few years back, the Daily News-Sun, 
Sun City's newspaper, cooked a TV dinner in the back seat of a car 
and popped microwave popcorn in the trunk during a 122-degree day. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona, it's worth noting, defiantly doesn't use daylight  
savings time. Conventional wisdom says Arizonans want to 
distinguish themselves from Californians, but people also joke that 
it's because the daylight isn't worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's a dry heat,'' insists Phoenician after Phoenician  
(the term, believe it or not, for a Phoenix resident), trying to 
explain what draws so many retired Americans to this region. 
There's even a popular T-shirt sold here that shows a sun-baked 
skeleton uttering the dry-heat mantra. 
</P>
<P>
	``C'mon,'' snaps David Tatum, curator of collections at the  
Arizona Historical Society. ``You cook a chicken in dry heat, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the historical society's archive sits a cylinder of pink  
flannel strips attached to a tiny fan -- one of Arizona's earliest 
swamp coolers, built by a man named Gust Goettl to cool his niece's 
room. Goettl and his brothers became pioneers in keeping Arizona 
cool; their company is still around today. 
</P>
<P>
	The society's exhibits show how heat, and fighting it, has  
defined the region. The ice-lined coffins that 19th-century Phoenix 
morticians employed to keep bodies cool. The adobe huts that 
insulated Indians. The people who'd pick spots on the buttes and 
mesas outside Tempe, carry up sheets (or even entire beds), wet 
them down, wrap themselves up and go to sleep. The state hospital 
that hung soaked cloth in the windows and hoped for wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every part of our lives is shaped by the desert,'' a sonorous  
voice intones in the society's history film. ``We who live here are 
continually forced by the desert to think ahead and invent our 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The future, for Phoenix, would be the air conditioner.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Years ago, a disgruntled Arizona Democrat, grumbling about how  
the state's politics turned toward the GOP after World War II, came 
up with a theory. Maybe, he said, air conditioning brought the 
Republicans in. 
</P>
<P>
	He was partially right. You'll hear it over and over here: Air  
conditioning brought 'em in. And not just Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Air conditioning may mean comfort in Boston and safety in  
Atlanta, but in Phoenix it's related to existence itself. True, the 
Southwestern desert was home to Apaches and settled by pioneers, 
but it was mass-marketed by artificial cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't go to Phoenix or Dallas or Houston without air  
conditioning,'' says Chrysanthe B. Broikos, curator of an exhibit 
on air conditioning's history at the National Building Museum in 
Washington. ``You certainly don't make your home there. And 
corporations don't decide to go there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the years after the war, as air conditioning became cheaper  
and more available for homes, people and corporations did decide to 
go: Between 1950 and 1995, Arizona's population grew by 462 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, a Phoenix city councilman proclaimed his town ``Air  
Conditioned Capital of the World.'' And today's culture of air 
conditioning defines Phoenix's very existence as much as the heat 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	People get arrested for smuggling banned coolants from Mexico.  
They assault one another when air conditioners break. Air 
conditioning has even impacted how people build their homes: The 
high ceilings, deep porches and wide eaves of traditional 
architecture, designed to keep occupants cool and hot air rising, 
have been replaced by the flat ranch-house homefronts and huge 
picture windows of the air-conditioned subdivision. Worried about 
the glass letting in heat? Just crank up the a/c! 
</P>
<P>
	In the Phoenix phone book are 35 pages of air-conditioning  
stores, contractors and repair outfits (Pittsburgh, by comparison, 
has five pages). In summer, their employees race around in vans, 
trying to keep up with the people whose air conditioners are broken 
and who are sure it's a life-and-death issue. It can be. 
</P>
<P>
	George Brazil's Jim Belnap has heard all the pleas: ``I have an  
elderly mother.'' ``I have an elderly mother and a baby.'' ``I'm 
going to sue you if we die.'' But he's sure that if people took 
care of their air conditioners in the off-season, they'd be better 
off when the Big Heat comes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They won't maintain the things,'' he grouses. ``We spend all  
spring trying to get people to let us come to their house and check 
things out. But the reality is, we spend April playing cards with 
the Maytag man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the electric bills -- up to $300 a month in the  
hot months. Virtually all cooling in Arizona -- fan, swamp cooler, 
air conditioning -- is electric, and the many newcomers aren't 
expecting what comes from the power company in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their first summer here, it's like buying a car. It's sticker  
shock,'' says Scott Harelson, a spokesman for the Salt River 
Project, a Phoenix power company. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sun City five years ago, an elderly woman on a fixed income  
decided to turn off her air conditioner during a 120-degree day. 
She flipped on her evaporative cooler; it blew out hot air. They 
found her expired on her bed, her dog dead beside her. 
</P>
<P>
	Such restraint is not exactly common. Most people crank the  
thermostat and worry later. On Aug. 28, 1998, between 5 and 6 p.m. 
the Salt River Project had its highest usage ever -- 4,666 megawatts 
at one time. Given that one megawatt is enough energy to power 100 
homes, this was no small affair. No coincidence, either, that it 
was at the time when people are getting home from work and cooling 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	A big chunk of it that evening came from Bank One Ballpark,  
where the newly-minted Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Milwaukee 
Brewers, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Below the indoor ballpark's third-base line, inside room 1309,  
sits one whompus of an air conditioner -- a jungle of consoles, 
control panels and John Goodman-sized pipes that carry chilled air 
to the baseball faithful on triple-digit evenings. In charge of it 
is Greg Myrick, who operates the coolers from a personal computer 
in a nearby room. 
</P>
<P>
	During ballgames, Myrick's men roam the stands with handheld  
thermometers, measuring temperatures and barking results into 
walkie talkies. The target: 74 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Chillers are turned on five hours before game time to cool the  
park after its retractable roof has been open to let the natural 
grass grow. Outside, across railroad tracks, sit four cement 
towers, each filled with water and a 12-foot fan that cools it 
before it's pumped into the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	It makes for a better experience than Myrick remembers in  
outdoor minor-league parks around here. ``We were sweating at 7 
p.m.,'' he recalls on a recent afternoon. ``With this, I think 
people are really starting to enjoy baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he opens a stadium door to emerge into the 115-degree heat  
and pushes it closed behind him. WHOOSH! Maricopa County's most 
formidable air conditioner blows it open once more. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond the swamp cooler, beyond the air conditioner, in a realm  
all his own, Steve Utter is master -- mister, you might say -- of all 
he surveys. This is a guy who must be from central Arizona. He 
makes statements like this: ``Ever since I was a boy, I dreamed of 
creating an artificial environment you could take with you wherever 
you went.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did. Utter is the inventor of MistyMate, a personal-sized  
``mister'' that uses a fan to blow a fine spray of water on its 
user. He built it to comfort his landscaping company's sweltering 
employees; he liked it so much that he founded a company. Now he 
hawks misters on QVC. 
</P>
<P>
	Misters -- the large, institutional ones and the smaller ones  
like Utter manufactures -- are Phoenix's most recent answer to heat. 
Larger ones, built into the masonry of public buildings, allow the 
brave and the hardy to eat lunch at outdoor tables and stand in 
lines without collapsing. Smaller ones, like many MistyMates, are 
aimed at the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
	Only in a climate where the average yearly rainfall is 7.7  
inches would people tolerate machines that squirt water at them in 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
	Utter's MistyMates -- he favors the ``Arctic Blast Professional''  
model -- are used on cattle, outside warehouses, on some NFL 
sidelines and, in one PR masterstroke last year, on a Phoenix 
football crowd, thanks to a ``cool cannon'' that Utter shot into 
the stands like a bazooka. His latest model is worn like a fanny 
pack. You spray water, and a battery-operated fan blows it up 
toward your face. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't about seeking comfort. You walk out there and you  
feel the pain,'' he says. ``This was invented because I live 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And so it goes in Phoenix, where cool has become a birthright  
and the air conditioner mere background noise, changing our 
instincts about where to spend time, allowing us to cultivate major 
cities where none existed before. Perhaps even changing us forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Think of it: a society of indoor people, hiding from global  
warming, taking refuge in cooled buildings from an ever more 
vicious Sun God. The apparatus of comfort making us weak. Will it 
happen? Maybe it already has. But in the Valley of the Sun, it was 
hot yesterday, it's hot today and it's going to be hot tomorrow. 
They do what they can. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, it's just another Phoenix summer afternoon -- hot,  
parched and deserted, cement, glass and desert. And everywhere you 
turn, another environment waiting to be cooled, another innovation 
waiting to happen, another chance for man to find a way to beat or 
cheat the sun, if only for a few comfortable, necessary moments. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's one consolation: It is, after all, a dry heat.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A top heavyweight boxing contender accused of  
raping a woman in his hotel room had to be removed from a courtroom 
following an outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	Ike Ibeabuchi, 26, known as ``The President'' in the ring, was  
scheduled to be arraigned Friday but was removed from court after 
he became upset that the prosecution wanted bail set at $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi is to return to court for arraignment on Aug. 6. He  
will continue to be held without bail in the Clark County Detention 
Center pending the court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi, undefeated at 20-0 with 15 knockouts and ranked No. 2  
by the IBF, is charged with sexual assault, attempted sexual 
assault, kidnapping and battery with intent to commit sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	All the charges stem from an incident at The Mirage on July 22  
when a 21-year-old entertainer told police she was raped by the 
boxer after being called to his suite.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was no time to be sick.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Humbert's ear was so infected when the Pan American Games  
water polo competition began, he missed the first two matches in 
the Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired, his head aching, his chest congested, his ear shut,  
Humbert and several ailing teammates set up a sick bay where they 
rested between matches. Their bodies were suffering, but their game 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Humbert scored five goals Friday night as the  
United States beat Cuba 11-7 to claim the gold medal and earn a 
trip to the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to the pool and my temperature was 101,'' Humbert said.  
``This week hasn't been a lot of fun. We had to quarantine all the 
sick guys. We've come through some adversity, and this feels 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humbert's offense was a big part of the Americans' commanding  
victory over a Cuban team they beat just 6-4 when their lanky 
two-meter man couldn't play early in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sparking the United States was the defense and  
length-of-the-pool passing of goalie Daniel Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Oeding and Humbert got behind the Cuban defense and  
took long passes from Hackett for easy scores within 40 seconds of 
one another to open the second period and make it 4-1. The United 
States led 6-2 at the half and 10-3 after three periods, using 
their superior swimming ability and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could throw one any better than the one to  
Chris,'' Hackett said. ``You're always confident he will finish any 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game was just a test because half our guys have the flu,  
including Chris. He couldn't even practice all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's basketball team looked like a group that hasn't  
spent much time together, which is precisely the case, but still 
won its opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserves Michelle Marciniak and Amy Herrig gave Team USA the  
spark it needed to get past Argentina 63-55. Marciniak got the 
Americans going with two length-of-the-court drives for baskets, 
and Herrig had 15 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States isn't using a top team in the Pan Am Games,  
and the players didn't start practicing until July 17. The lack of 
time together was evident as coach Nell Fortner substituted 
constantly looking for the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can practice all you want, but the real experience comes  
from playing games with refs, scorekeepers, fans and everything 
else,'' Marciniak said. ``There's no substitute for that. We 
learned more tonight than from all the practices going against each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men open tonight against Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. pitcher Michele Smith almost duplicated teammate Danielle  
Henderson's perfect game in Thursday's softball opener. Smith was 
perfect through six innings before yielding a hit in a 5-0 victory 
over Netherlands Antilles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans dominated the final night of track and field by winning  
five of the 10 events, including a fourth straight Pan Ams gold by 
high jumper Javier Sotomayor. Sotomayor took only two jumps, 
clearing 7 feet, 2 1/2 inches and 7-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Also winning for Cuba was Anier Garcia, who ran the 110-meter  
hurdles in 13.17 seconds to break one of the meet's oldest records, 
13.20 by Renaldo Nehemiah in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba finished track and field with 11 gold medals. That was one  
more than the United States, which was shut out in the relays and 
failed to win a gold Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tremendous,'' said Jose Salmeron, spokesman for the  
Cuban team. ``We did it with spectacular marks and in spite of not 
having as many key athletes as in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also suffered disappointments in field hockey and  
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Any chances for the United States to qualify for the Olympics in  
men's field hockey ended with a 4-1 loss to Argentina. The men's 
volleyball team fell out of medal contention when it lost to 
Venezuela 25-21, 28-26, 25-22. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in the games, the U.S. women's volleyball  
team was swept by Cuba, but the Americans could still win the 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better for the United States in the ring on the  
opening night of boxing. Flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles beat 
Carlos Valcarcel of Puerto Rico in the new format of four 
two-minute rounds. Welterweight LeChaunce Shepherd of Milwaukee, 
Wis., stopped Nicaragua's Isaac Caballero in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won the premier rowing event, the men's eight with  
cox. The U.S. team took control at 500 meters and won by nearly 
three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, an official from the International Baseball  
Association told several reporters that two Cuban baseball players 
had defected. But Canadian immigration officials and sources close 
to the Cuban team said the official was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the players mentioned by IBA delegate Enzo Gesu was  
pitcher Jose Ibar. But he was in the dugout today when Cuba 
advanced to the semifinals by beating the Dominican Republic 3-1.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Gets Another Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- What the Women's World Cup started in  
the United States, those at the Pan American Games hope to push a 
little more down the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after the second Women's Football  
Symposium in Los Angeles finished with a call for more women's 
age-limited tournaments -- and specifically a world championship -- 
five under-20 national teams have gathered in Winnipeg to compete 
for only the second confederation-sanctioned youth crown offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very positive to have this competition immediately after  
the World Cup,'' said Mexican coach Leonardo Cuellar, who also 
coached Mexico's women's team at USA '99 and brought five members 
of that squad to Winnipeg. ``The TV is here. This is being shown in 
Mexico. It is giving exposure to what needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Pan Ams starting only 13 days after the Women's World  
Cup final, CONCACAF, which was given virtual control of the event, 
decided to make it an under-20 competition. 
</P>
<P>
	That limited the number of countries participating because most  
nations barely field a senior national team, let alone an underage 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the United States sent essentially its under-18  
team because of its commitment to the Nordic Cup, an annual 
invitational that for a little less than a decade has stood as a de 
facto youth championship. 
</P>
<P>
	That eight-team event is set for Iceland on Aug. 2-8.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's obvious to the rest of the world that we're being  
very aggressive in an area of the game that needs promotion,'' 
CONCACAF deputy general secretary Ted Howard said. ``We also know 
we need to promote it in our member nations where it may not be the 
most accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only last week, CONCACAF joined Asia, Africa, Europe and South  
America in announcing that next year it will stage a continental 
championship for women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pan Ams is only the second non-exhibition title for  
girls, following in the path of last year's European under-18 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's clear those associated with the women's programs are  
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tremendous for our younger players,'' said Canada  
coach Neil Turnbull, who like Cuellar coached his country's senior 
team at the Women's World Cup. ``One thing we lack is World 
Cup-level experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to bring a new girl into the national team, her  
first cap might be against the United States -- the best team in the 
world. Her second might be against China. (The Pan Ams) is 
international soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles two days before the World Cup final, Per Ravn  
Omdal of Norway, chairman of FIFA's Committee for Women's Football, 
said the creation of more women's championships, and specifically 
youth events, would spur confederations and national associations 
into creating and supporting women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is also the concern youth tournaments will widen the  
gap between the haves and have nots of women's soccer. The belief 
is that already developed powers will further improve, while others 
will become discouraged from getting pounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly at the Pan Ams, the United States, Canada and Mexico are  
in one tier, with Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago in another. 
</P>
<P>
	In four games, the Americans and Canadians routed Costa Rica and  
Trinidad by a combined score of 25-2. The scores were similar to 
some seen during World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talent pool (at the youth level), despite gains, is not  
that big,'' 1999 Women's World Cup spokesman Aaron Heifetz said 
from his office in Los Angeles. ``It's much tougher for developing 
nations to put together teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, even for those that get pummeled, some see positives.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on what you do with it, how you view it,'' said  
U.S. coach Jay Hoffman, who also used to coach the U.S. men's 
under-20 team. ``It depends on what you do as a follow-up. If 
somebody just brought a team here, but doesn't do anything until a 
year from now ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If you bring a team in here, and next month you do a little  
more, and then a little more ... I assume all countries here are 
attempting to improve. If that's the case, it will only help sport, 
only help the confederation.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Mets Trade Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Rockies and Mets swapped center fielders  
and left-handed relievers Saturday night, with Darryl Hamilton and 
Chuck McElroy going to New York and Colorado getting Brian McRae 
and Rigo Beltran. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies also got minor league outfielder Thomas Johnson in  
the deal, announced about 20 minutes before the Rockies played the 
Cardinals and about four hours ahead of the midnight EDT trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, batting .303 with four homers and 24 RBIs, had been in  
the Rockies lineup and hitting second against the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He and McElroy, 3-1 with a 6.20 ERA, were called off the 
field during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planned to join the Mets on Sunday in Chicago and were  
happy about landing with a contending team. Todd Helton was 
inserted in the No. 2 slot and played first base, and hit a two-run 
homer in the third. Jeff Barry played center field and batted 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised, but a little relieved that it's  
over,'' Hamilton said. ``I gained about 25 games in a five-minute 
phone call. That makes it a little more interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy, who has a 3.64 career ERA, also was looking forward to  
a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``The adrenaline is going now,'' McElroy said. ``I didn't have  
the kind of year I wanted to here, so I'm looking forward to having 
some fun over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, 31, has been a disappointment with the Mets, batting .221  
with eight homers and 36 RBIs and stealing only two bases in eight 
attempts. He has been with the Mets about two years after coming 
from the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 8, 1997, in a deal that involved 
Lance Johnson and Mark Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Beltran, 29, was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk July 25.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal apparently was attractive from a financial standpoint  
to the Rockies. Hamilton and McElroy are in the first year of 
three-year contracts, while McRae is in the final year of his 
contract and Beltran is not arbitration-eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets figured Hamilton was a nice upgrade in center field.  
</P>
<P>
	``Darryl's hitting over .300 right now and we think he's going  
to improve us offensively and defensively,'' general manager Steve 
Phillips said. ``Unfortunately, Brian couldn't get anything going 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy waived a no-trade clause to New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``When this time comes and teams need left-handed pitchers, you  
expect something,'' McElroy said. ``I thought it was going to be 
Houston or the Yankees or maybe San Diego.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this season, McRae had questioned manager Bobby  
Valentine's lineups. Shortly thereafter, the Mets put McRae and 
Bobby Bonilla on irrevocable waivers, though no team claimed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Brian couldn't get anything going this year,''  
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	McRae left Wrigley Field shortly after a 17-10 loss to the Cubs  
and was unavailable for comment. He did not play in the game.

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Flutie Starting QB for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- While defenders found it difficult to  
touch him, fans have had no problem getting to Buffalo Bills 
quarterback Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds after the last snap of the first session of training  
camp Saturday, Flutie found them. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed shirts, hats and helmets. He shook tiny hands. ``Whose  
pen is this?'' he said. ``Hey, what are you doing? Are you coming 
back for seconds here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove all the way from Las Vegas just to get your  
autograph,'' one man said. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl standing in the bleachers yelled ``Hey Doug!'' and  
giggled as Flutie looked up. 
</P>
<P>
	New season, same old question: Who's the Buffalo Bills' starting  
quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer is Flutie, at least for now.  
</P>
<P>
	Ever since an odd bounce and a big hit, not to mention a porous  
offensive line, sidelined starter Rob Johnson early last season, 
Flutie has been The One. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been everywhere. On cereal boxes, in Hawaii  
for the Pro Bowl, in a band with his brother Darren, at Fenway Park 
for the All-Star game's Celebrity Hitting Challenge with another 
local favorite, actor Matt Damon. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a cowboy hat when he appeared in television commercials  
for a grocery store chain, and recently he donned a cap and gown 
for commencement at Cazenovia College where 250 graduates heard his 
appeal for self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie showed Buffalo last year that a little belief in oneself  
can go a long way as he took them from 0-3 to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a winner, regardless of what anybody says about his  
height,'' receiver Andre Reed said after Flutie took over.

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Flutie Starting QB for Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- While defenders found it difficult to  
touch him, fans have had no problem getting to Buffalo Bills 
quarterback Doug Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	Seconds after the last snap of the first session of training  
camp Saturday, Flutie found them. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed shirts, hats and helmets. He shook tiny hands. ``Whose  
pen is this?'' he said. ``Hey, what are you doing? Are you coming 
back for seconds here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove all the way from Las Vegas just to get your  
autograph,'' one man said. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl standing in the bleachers yelled ``Hey Doug!'' and  
giggled as Flutie looked up. 
</P>
<P>
	New season, same old question: Who's the Buffalo Bills' starting  
quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer is Flutie, at least for now.  
</P>
<P>
	Ever since an odd bounce and a big hit, not to mention a porous  
offensive line, sidelined starter Rob Johnson early last season, 
Flutie has been The One. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he has been everywhere. On cereal boxes, in Hawaii  
for the Pro Bowl, in a band with his brother Darren, at Fenway Park 
for the All-Star game's Celebrity Hitting Challenge with another 
local favorite, actor Matt Damon. 
</P>
<P>
	He wore a cowboy hat when he appeared in television commercials  
for a grocery store chain, and recently he donned a cap and gown 
for commencement at Cazenovia College where 250 graduates heard his 
appeal for self-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie showed Buffalo last year that a little belief in oneself  
can go a long way as he took them from 0-3 to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a winner, regardless of what anybody says about his  
height,'' receiver Andre Reed said after Flutie took over. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, fans love Flutie.  
</P>
<P>
	``They relate to me,'' he said. ``They feel that I'm an average  
Joe, so they can get out there and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since joining the Bills as an also-ran and earning the NFL's

<HEADLINE> Aldrin Wants Space Travel for All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The second man to walk on the moon  
says he would like to give ordinary citizens the chance to follow 
in his footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin says that when space travel is  
opened up to private citizens, it should not be an exclusive 
privilege of the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he would like to see everyone given the chance through  
a sweepstakes-like contest. Aldrin has formed a nonprofit company 
called ShareSpace Foundation Inc., to research the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to start setting a precedent'' of allowing private  
citizens to go into space, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldrin made his remarks to reporters Friday before narrating an  
evening performance by the Philadelphia Orchestra at the Saratoga 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 30 years ago this month that Aldrin and Neil Armstrong  
took mankind's first steps on the lunar surface. Currently, Aldrin 
is traveling the globe to discuss his and others' latest ideas for 
exploring the universe.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Hits Moon, No Dust Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lunar Prospector's violent collision with the  
moon on Saturday left no visible cloud of dust, but researchers 
still hope to find traces of water in a vapor plume possibly 
created by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 observatory telescopes focused on the moon's south  
pole as the spacecraft, in its final task for science, dove toward 
a frozen crater and smashed itself around 5:52 a.m. EDT Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts hoped the fire and violence of the collision, unseen  
from the Earth, would vaporize ice thought to exist in the shaded 
crater and send a wet plume, detectable by special instruments, 
spiraling into the lunar sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin S. Barker of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory,  
a lead researcher in the project, said telescopes equipped with 
ultraviolet detectors took hours of data following the impact, 
searching for the chemical signature of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really too early to draw any conclusions,'' Barker said.  
``So far, we haven't seen anything that says water or anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final results of the water search await analysis of the readings  
by the telescopes in Texas, California, Massachusetts and Hawaii, 
and by the Hubble Space Telescope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	What researchers are looking for is either water, H2O, or the  
hydroxyl radical, called OH, formed when sunlight splits a hydrogen 
atom away from a water molecule. Both OH and water have distinctive 
spectroscopic signatures when viewed with special telescope 
filters. 
</P>
<P>
	The signature for water could be found quickly in the data, said  
Barker, but uncovering evidence of the hydroxyl radical could take 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for water is more than a scientific curiosity. Large  
stores of ice on the moon would make it much easier and cheaper to 
establish a base there, or to use the moon as a way station to more 
distant bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Water can be broken down chemically into hydrogen and oxygen  
that can propel a rocket or power generators. Oxygen also would 
provide a breathable atmosphere for lunar explorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was scheduled to end its mission on Saturday,  
and scientists running the $63 million project decided smashing the 
craft into the moon in search for water was a fitting end. 
</P>
<P>
	David Morse, a NASA spokesman at the Ames Research Center in  
Moffett Field, Calif., said mission scientists ``were very happy 
and whooped it up a little'' when it became clear the craft had hit 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and spent about 18 months  
in lunar orbit, using five instruments to map the magnetic, 
chemical and gravitational character of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	One instrument received a signal for hydrogen, leading  
scientists to suggest there was frozen water in the deep, 
constantly shaded craters around the lunar poles. By some 
estimates, the could be as much as 300 million metric tons of ice 
in the frozen lunar soil. 
</P>
<P>
	David B. Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher, was the  
first to suggest using Prospector as sort of a rocket-powered 
diving rod. He did calculations that showed if Prospector crashed 
into one of the frigid craters, heat from the impact could vaporize 
the ice and form a wet cloud visible from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although mission scientists believed there was only a 10 percent  
chance of success, the possibility of harvesting a final bit of 
science was worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said Saturday that he also had hoped for a dust cloud,  
but none was seen by any of the 20 or so observatory telescopes 
that focused on the moon at the moment of impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't see any dust. It is a bit of a disappointment,'' he  
said. ``We know it crashed. We just don't know where exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers,  
or ALPO, encouraged amateur astronomers to focus telescopes on the 
moon and report any signs of Prospector's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of obvious evidence, officials said Lunar  
Prospector appeared to have followed the instructions from the 
ground to slow itself with an automatic rocket firing and then 
smash against the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact point was not visible from Earth, but NASA engineers  
believe that the craft was in line to hit the target crater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went normally, so we have every reason to believe  
it made it to the impact site,'' said David Folta, the Goddard 
Space Flight Center engineer who gave the final guidance signals to 
Prospector. ``There is no reason to believe we didn't get to where 
we wanted to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folta said the spacecraft received the signals and was operating  
normally when it went over the lunar north pole and disappeared 
behind the moon where it was to ignite its rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the rocket firing failed, said Folta, the craft would have  
reappeared in orbit, still sending out radio signals. Instead, 
there was only silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker said there is a possibility the spacecraft hit at such a  
shallow angle that it skipped, like a flat stone across a pond, 
before it came to rest. This would diminish the dust cloud, he 
said, but there could still be a water plume.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Claims 145 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Twenty-six more people have died from the heat in  
Chicago, pushing Illinois' heat-related death toll to 50 and the 
number of heat deaths around the country to 145, even as Saturday 
brought a glimpse of cool to parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 20 deaths in Chicago may be heat-related and were  
under investigation, Mayor Richard Daley said, announcing the 
latest deaths from the heat wave that scorched much of the nation 
and produced New York City's hottest July on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest deaths in Chicago on Friday and Saturday brought the  
nation's heat-related death toll to at least 145 since July 19. The 
fiftieth death in Illinois was in the far southern city of 
Metropolis, where a woman who died of heat exhaustion was found in 
the tub. 
</P>
<P>
	``This heat is some serious stuff, man,'' said George Wilder  
Jr., a security guard working downtown who took the day off Friday 
to check on his 85-year-old grandmother. ``She's doing fine. I'm 
glad, because I only have one grandmother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago hit 99 degrees during the week, though by Saturday a  
front moving through the region lowered temperatures to the 80s. 
Despite the cooler weather, Daley urged residents to check on 
relatives and friends, particularly those who were elderly or ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could save their life,'' he said. In 1995, more than 700  
elderly Chicagoans died in extreme heat. Daley warned that more 
deaths may be discovered in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the East continued to sizzle, with temperatures in the  
eastern two-thirds of North Carolina soaring into triple digits 
Saturday for a record-setting eighth time this year. The 104-degree 
reading at Raleigh-Durham International Airport broke the 1983 mark 
of seven days over 100 degrees in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cities in Oklahoma, Hobart and Tipton, hit 108.  
Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina hit 
a record high of 104; Louisville, Ky., and Parkersburg, W.Va., were 
at 102; and Columbus, Ohio and Columbus, Ind., both reached 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia peaked at 99 degrees on Saturday, making it the  
ninth straight day above 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where temperatures had climbed above 90 for the  
last eight days, the thermometer ``only'' hit 88 degrees in Central 
Park. So ended the hottest July in New York City history. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were predicting that the first few days of August  
would offer some much-needed relief to the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutal heat stretched across much of the nation. In more  
than a dozen states, people were found dead in homes and apartments 
without air-conditioning or fans. One of the most recent was a 
North Carolina migrant farm worker whose body temperature hit 108 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	In Missouri, 39 deaths were blamed on the heat. Most of the  
victims were elderly and had air conditioning but didn't use it 
because they were worried about high utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat and humidity may have been a factor in a plane crash  
that killed nine skydivers and a pilot north of Detroit, federal 
investigators said. Such conditions make it harder for a plane to 
take off. 
</P>
<P>
	In Burlington, Vt., the temperature reached a record high of 96.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being in a sauna,'' said Jeni Humphries, who was  
selling groceries at a farmer's market in Montpelier, Vt. ``Though 
in a sauna, you can just sit there, and in this you have to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, temperatures climbed above 100 degrees in some  
areas. On Friday night, severe thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 
70 mph toppled trees, downed power lines and killed two people. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder, the Chicago security guard, said he followed the advice  
to drink lots of fluids. But he does more than drink water to keep 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe as many showers as I can,'' he said. ``It really  
works. Not just for old people. For anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, thunderstorms and a cold front should finally bring  
temperatures into the 80s for New York and its suburbs, said 
National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should get a break, finally,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Safety Perry Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers free safety Darren Perry  
retired Saturday, the day before the team flew to Australia for its 
exhibition opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Riley said the seven-year veteran knocked on his door  
at 7:30 a.m. and told him he was retiring due to an ailment in his 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shocking to everybody,'' Riley said. ``He had had some  
problems with nerves in his shoulder, stingers, the last couple of 
years. They made him uncomfortable enough for him to say he can't 
play the game either the way he wants to, or we would want him to 
physically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said general manager Bobby Beathard: ``I had no clue.''  
</P>
<P>
	Perry joined the Chargers as an unrestricted free agent from  
Pittsburgh, signing a $3.25 million, two-year contract 
</P>
<P>
	A starter since being taken by the Steelers in the eighth round  
of the 1992 draft, Perry started all 110 games he played in and had 
32 interceptions. He missed two starts last year, including the 
season finale with a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The free safety job likely will revert to Michael Dumas, San  
Diego's starter for all of 1997 and the first three games of 1998 
before he suffered a knee injury in practice and underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers leave Sunday for Sydney, where they'll play the  
Denver Broncos next Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Red Bow Tie Wins in Breeder's Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Red Bow Tie won his second straight  
Breeders Crown Open Pace on Saturday, edging Color Me Best by a 
neck and becoming the richest gelding in harness racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	Red Bow Tie's stirring victory in the $380,000 race came after  
beating back a neck-and-neck challenge from Color Me Best coming 
down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year old son of Raging Glory, trained by Marty Gelrod and  
driven by Luc Ouelette, took the lead before the half post and, 
despite constant pressure from Color Me Best, refused to be denied. 
He covered the mile in 1:50 and earned $180,000, increasing his 
career earnings to $2,096,163. Red Bow Tie who was sent off at 2-1 
odds and paid $4.80. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, lightly raced Super Grit came roaring down the  
stretch to edge Fern by 2 1/2 lengths in the $580,000 Breeders Crown 
Trot in a career-best 1:53 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Grit, trained by Carl Conte Jr. and driven by Ron Pierce,  
was making just his fourth and fifth starts of the season and 
notched his second win by coming off the pace to pass the tiring 
Fern down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Fern, who had won the Breeders Crown elimination three races  
earlier, was unable to hold off Super Grit in the final strides 
after beating back an earlier challenge from Mister Goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Super Grit, who has been raced little in the past year due to  
soundness problems, finished third in the elimination but had 
plenty left for his stretch drive in the final. The $290,000 
winner's purse more than doubled his winnings for the past two 
years and increased the 6-year old son of Supergill's career 
earnings to $973,768. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $282,500 Breeders Crown Open Pace for Mares, 50-1 long  
shot Shore By Five won with a stunning stretch drive that allowed 
her to overtake 6-5 favorite Sanabelle Island and hold off 
fast-closing Extreme Velocity to win by a nose in 1:50 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Shore By Five, fourth at the top of the stretch, put on a  
surprising burst of speed to pass tiring Sanabelle Island, who led 
most of the race. The Canadian-based mare had to hold off a late 
challenge from Extreme Velocity to win by a nose. Shore by Five's 
payoff of $108.20 was the third-largest in Breders Crown history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as shocked and surprised as anyone,'' Shore By Five's  
trainer, Bob McIntosh, said. ``I considered her a long shot who 
could maybe finish fourth or fifth. We were just hoping to get back 
our entry fee. But Daniel (Dube) gave her a great drive, the big 
fractions worked in her favor and she showed a lot of character 
down the stretch.''

<HEADLINE> Safety Interests Change Playgrounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seesaws and sandboxes are things of the past.  
Monkey bars are an endangered species. And places where kids can 
hide are too scary for grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's playground aims to be safer, cleaner and less prone to  
lawsuits than those of decades past. Critics who see 
rough-and-tumble fun as a vital part of childhood disapprove, but 
playground experts say the new equipment is reducing serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to take all the excitement out of the playground  
-- the risk-taking, the fun, the ability to succeed,'' says Fran 
Wallach, a board member for the National Program for Playground 
Safety. ``On the other hand, we want to remove all the hazards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, more than 200,000 children a year are injured  
seriously enough on playgrounds to require trips to emergency 
rooms. The most common serious injuries are broken bones, but for 
children 4 or younger, almost 60 percent of the injuries involve 
the face or brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the statistics, experts say playground safety has  
dramatically improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to a generation ago, playgrounds are so much safer,''  
says Tracy Shelton, who helped survey playground safety for the New 
York Public Interest Research Group and found the city's 
playgrounds did well compared to others around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that if you fell, you were probably going to  
break something. You were falling from a higher height and on to a 
harder surface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, thanks to rubber surfacing, a kid who loses his grip can  
fall on his shoulder and get up without so much as a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	New York was the first U.S. city to put rubber mats under all  
equipment. It also was the first city to fence off every swing set 
to keep kids from getting kicked as they run by. You won't find 
old-fashioned rectangular monkey bars either. They've been replaced 
by boxy, colorful climbing structures with interconnected ramps, 
rungs, ladders, steps, slides and guard rails. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City is undertaking its most ambitious program of  
playground renovation since public works czar Robert Moses built 
650 outdoor play spaces around the city in the 1930s, '40s and 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandboxes are being removed because people allow their dogs to  
relieve themselves in the absorbent sand. Tunnels are out of style 
because parents get nervous when kids can't be seen. Sprinklers 
have replaced unsanitary wading pools. And seesaws are going 
because kids fall off or plunk down so hard they injure their 
spines. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents complain the new playgrounds are boring and  
accurately blame the fear of litigation for some of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're maybe being made too sterile in the interest  
of avoiding lawsuits,'' says Michele Herman, a Manhattan mother of 
two. ``It's sad, the loss of all the seesaws. It's a shame, this 
whole generation, growing up without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because 90 percent of lawsuits involving playground injuries are  
settled out of court and leave no paper trail, it's difficult to 
assess their impact, says Donna Thompson, head of the National 
Program for Public Safety. But city Parks Commissioner Henry Stern 
acknowledges the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in such an antiseptic, risk-free society,'' Stern  
says. ``You want to eliminate the obvious hazards. But you're 
dealing with children at play who are out to show they can do 
something they couldn't do last week. So you tend to get the 
blandest, least challenging playground equipment because you don't 
want some lawyer to say, 'The playground is a trap.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, a pediatric surgeon led a  
crusade to improve playgrounds. Dr. Barbara Barlow of Harlem 
Hospital noticed a lot of kids coming in with injuries from the 
street -- hit by cars, falling on concrete -- because local 
playgrounds were full of drug addicts, homeless people and broken 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow took her findings to Stern, and he renovated every public  
playground in Harlem -- 18 since 1990. They are kept so clean 
children can go barefoot in the sprinklers without fear of broken 
glass. And after Barlow sent a photograph of a child's hand impaled 
on a spiked iron fence, Stern had every fence sheared of its 
pointed tops. 
</P>
<P>
	The public health benefits are gratifying.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our major injuries have decreased 55 percent,'' Barlow says.  
``In the past we might have seen 350 seriously injured kids in a 
year. Now we see between 120 and 150.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A follow-up study found that ``for every dollar we spent on our  
playground programs, we saved $4 in acute health care and $85 in 
lifetime health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow's work has grown into a national organization, the  
Injury-Free Coalition for Kids, which has helped design parks in 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing better,'' Barlow says, ``than cutting the  
ribbon and watching kids attack playgrounds.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings Use Loss To Motivate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- When the Minnesota Vikings convene Sunday  
for training camp, last season's loss to Atlanta in the NFC 
championship game will serve as motivation for some players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons' 30-27 overtime victory on Jan. 17 prevented the  
Vikings from going to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1977. 
The Vikings open the regular season on Sept. 12 against the Falcons 
in the Georgia Dome -- the site of this season's Super Bowl on Jan. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll use it,'' defensive tackle John Randle said. ``If  
anything, it's going to teach us about what it takes. Because this 
team had some young guys who really weren't sure what it was all 
about to get to the championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For others, last year's loss has already been forgotten.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think our team won't use the Atlanta game at all,'' coach  
Dennis Green said. ``I think our team will forget about last year 
and move forward to this year. The bottom line is you're not owed 
anything. We're not motivated by a loss. We're motivated by what's 
ahead of us, not what's behind us. We don't have to worry about 
last year. That's not going to help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings defensive line coach Andre Patterson said the team seems  
focused on this season, not the disappointing end to last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a bunch of hungry guys,'' Patterson said. ``They don't  
seem like a group that has the hurt and pain still lingering from 
that Atlanta game. I don't think there's any pity or feeling sorry 
for themselves. They have a lot of pride in what they did 
accomplish. Now it's time for us to work hard again and try to take 
it to that next level.''

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Woodstock Sex Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- A 26-year-old man was arrested and charged  
with sex crimes for an alleged assault on a 15-year-old girl as 
fires raged in the final hours of Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy A. Weeden, a state prison guard from Rome, was arrested  
early Monday soon after the alleged assault and was indicted 
Tuesday on charges of first-degree sodomy and sexual abuse, 
third-degree sodomy, and endangering the welfare of a child. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl left the concert grounds to use a bathroom at a gas  
station where she was allegedly forced to perform oral sex, said 
Bernadette Romano, Oneida County first assistant district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl fled and told a group of friends at the concert who  
returned to the gas station and apprehended Weeden with the help of 
several security guards from a nearby hospital, according to Oneida 
County Inv. Richard Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they did not know if Weeden had attended the  
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	State police investigating eight allegations of rapes -- four at  
the concert, three in the camping area and one near the mosh pit 
during a performance -- said pursuing leads will be difficult 
because the 225,000 concertgoers have scattered around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	They are reviewing a pay-per-view broadcast of the three-day  
event, and photos published in newspapers and on the Internet.

<HEADLINE> First Lady: Husband Has 'Weakness' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, answering  
questions about her husband's affair with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky and the scandal that followed, said his actions 
were ``a sin of weakness, not a sin of malice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton defended President Clinton as ``a very, very good  
man'' but said, ``Yes, he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more 
responsible, more disciplined,'' she told ``Talk'' magazine, 
according to a news release from the magazine Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, edited by former New Yorker editor Tina Brown,  
debuts on newstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned about the president's infidelity, Mrs. Clinton said,  
``I thought this was resolved ten years ago. ... I thought he had 
conquered it,'' according to a magazine press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also said her husband was scarred by abuse as a  
small child, but the press release did not provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also talked about her moves toward a run for a U.S.  
Senate seat in New York. ``Now for the first time I am making my 
own decisions. I can feel the difference. It is a great relief.''

<HEADLINE> Cuba Beats US Women in Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Emerging from the dressing room after  
a drubbing by Cuba, the first thing Nell Fortner did was apologize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry you had to sit through that,'' the U.S. women's  
basketball coach said while still managing a smile. ``I'm sorry I 
had to sit through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba handed the United States its worst loss ever in women's  
basketball at the Pan American Games, rolling past Fortner's team 
95-64 Saturday night. It also was the most points ever allowed by a 
U.S. women's team in Pan Ams play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely wouldn't call that our A game,'' U.S. forward  
Lynn Pride said. ``Cuba is very good and very athletic. They 
brought their A game and we didn't respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Cuba met in men's basketball later  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban women overwhelmed the United States with their  
quickness, slashing drives to the basket and trapping zone defense. 
They jumped to a 14-3 lead in the first five minutes and the 
Americans never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost to Brazil in the first round, led 54-27 at  
halftime and easily topped the previous worst defeat of a U.S. team 
in Pan Ams play, 60-42 by Brazil in 1967. The most points the 
United States surrendered previously came in a 107-92 victory over 
Brazil in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I was more disappointed after our win last night than  
I am tonight,'' said Fortner, whose team opened with a sluggish 
63-55 victory over Argentina. ``I thought we were totally 
overmatched tonight. We played hard, but we couldn't get our shots 
to fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some good looks early, but couldn't nail them. If we  
could have nailed some of them, it would have helped our confidence 
tremendously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States shot 27 percent in the first half (9-for-33)  
and 35 percent for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which has nine members of its 1996 Olympic team,  
constantly drove past the bewildered Americans for easy baskets and 
shot 61 percent. Of the Cubans' 32 baskets, 19 were layups or 
putbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good, but we know we're a lot better defensive team  
than that,'' Pride said. ``We had a lot of breakdowns. We usually 
rely on our help, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pride, who'll be a senior at Kansas, led the Americans with 15  
points. Michelle Marciniak scored 12 and Itoro Umoh 10. Licet 
Castillo led Cuba with 17 points. She did not play in the second 
half.

<HEADLINE> NASA Captures Images of Asteroid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- A NASA spacecraft that made the closest  
flyby ever of an asteroid has sent mission controllers infrared 
images of the asteroid, though it failed to capture closeup 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Deep Space 1 probe, which flew within an estimated 10 miles  
of the Asteroid Braille on Wednesday, began transmitting data from 
its infrared camera on Friday, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four black-and-white images were taken by the spacecraft's  
camera -- two about 70 minutes before its closest approach and two 
of poorer quality about 15 minutes after the encounter more than 
117 million miles from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft was unsuccessful in capturing close-ups of the  
giant orbiting rock because of a failure to aim the spacecraft's 
camera correctly. Pictures sent back showed only empty space. 
</P>
<P>
	The barrel-shaped, 8-foot spacecraft was launched in October and  
designed primarily to test new forms of technology for future 
deep-space flights. The mission costs $152 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Deep Space 1 will remain functional when its prime mission  
officially ends Sept. 18, and could fly by two comets in 2001 if an 
extended mission is funded.

<HEADLINE> Loaded Gun Wins Philly Breeders Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENSALEM, Pa. (AP) -- Jose Flores steered Loaded Gun outside of  
the leaders while turning into the homestretch and then kept his 
mount under strong pressure for a 1 1/4-length victory in the $200,000 
Philadelphia Park Breeders' Cup Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four-year-old Loaded Gun was in second place after a  
quarter-mile behind Power by Far, the eventual third-place 
finisher, when he pushed for the lead with a quarter-mile 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Flores credited owner-trainer Janice Gerace with instructions  
that gave Loaded Gun the win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miss Janice told me to go to the outside and then work it out  
from there. He just dragged me to the front.'' Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaded Gun's strong finish helped fight off the 7-to-10 favorite  
Artax, which overcame a walking start from the gate to finish 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaded Gun cover six furlongs in 1:08 4-5 to earn $60,000 for  
Ms. Gerace. His lifetime earnings stand at $275,180. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaded Gun returned $22.60, $5.80 and $4. Artax paid $3 and  
$2.40, and Power by Far was worth $5.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaded Gun will return to Monmouth Park, N.J., to await a sprint  
stake there, Ms. Gerace said.

	CROMWELL, Conn. (AP) -- An assistant to CBS golf commentator Gary  
McCord ran over the foot of a volunteer with a golf cart at the 
Greater Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Lewison, 46, is charged with second-degree reckless  
endangerment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewison and McCord were driving to a broadcast tower Thursday  
when they came across the volunteer marshal, who was roping off an 
area on the third hole. She told the pair the route they had chosen 
was off-limits, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lewison refused to listen to her,'' Cromwell Police Capt.  
Thomas Roohr said. ``He continued on and in the process of doing so 
ran over her foot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The marshal, whose name was not released, was treated at the  
tournament's medical service station. The extent of her injuries 
was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewison, from Wisconsin, is free on $500 bond and is due back in  
court Aug. 10.

someone got hurt over a misunderstanding,'' said LeslieAnne Wade, a

<HEADLINE> Dawson Injured at Steelers Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Center Dermontti Dawson, considered the  
player the Pittsburgh Steelers can least afford to lose, was 
injured during a pileup in Saturday afternoon's practice session. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson was taken off the field at St. Vincent College in the  
back of a pickup truck. The preliminary prognosis was a medial 
collateral ligament sprain in Dawson's right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Donahoe, the team's director of operations, said trainer  
John Norwig doesn't believe the injury is serious. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson's knee will be re-examined Sunday, and he'll probably  
return to Pittsburgh for an MRI test to determine the severity of 
the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dermontti got hurt in a 9-on-7 drill we had, but I don't think  
I want to speculate right now (about his status),'' Cowher said. 
``He's up in the training room, and if we get any further 
information we'll get it to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher also would not comment on Dawson's prospective  
replacement if he is out for the long term. Former Penn State 
standout Roger Duffy, a 10-year pro who started at left guard 
during Alan Faneca's excused absence, and 16-year veteran Jim 
Sweeney are the frontrunners to succeed Dawson if he is out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll be all right,'' Sweeney said. ``The guy's probably one  
of the greatest centers. He has to be one of the top three centers 
of all time, and maybe even the best. When you take a guy like that 
out of your offense, that's a big cog out of the wheel.''

Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the New England Revolution 4-1 Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Musa Shannon scored his 10th goal of the season and Carlos

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Linked to 94 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Talk about adding insult to injury.  
</P>
<P>
	As the city of Chicago baked in 100-degree weather, thousands of  
hot and sweaty residents were forced to endure the heat without air 
conditioning or fans, due to sporadic power outages and brownouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hour they say it's going to be back on. Nothing,'' Anna  
Losada, who lost power in her home, said Friday. ``It's ridiculous. 
We got to pay them every month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago residents were not the only ones suffering in extreme  
heat. A wide strip of the nation, from the central states to the 
East Coast, baked for another day Friday with some temperatures 
over 100 degrees and a heat index -- the combination of heat and 
humidity -- near 120. 
</P>
<P>
	The current heat wave has been linked to at least 94 deaths  
across the country since July 19. The Midwest has been hardest hit, 
with Missouri logging 29 heat-related deaths, Illinois 23 and 10 in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities across Missouri recorded the 15th straight day of  
temperatures in the 90s. Nashville set a record high of 101, 
breaking the old mark set in 1954. It was 99 in Chattanooga, Tenn., 
tying the mark set in 1952. In other areas, it was 104 degrees in 
Louisville, Ky., 102 degrees in Kenosha, Wis., and 99 degrees in 
Winona, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	While some areas were due to get some relief from the heat,  
other cities braced for more of the same over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	As the temperature peaked at 104 degrees Friday at Chicago's  
Midway Airport, up to 100,000 homes and businesses began feeling 
the electricity -- along with cool stream of air conditioning -- shut 
off. Power companies blamed excessive demand for the outage. Full 
power was not expected to be restored until later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a week of temperatures that were just building up  
every day going toward 100 degrees. We're setting peak demand 
records every day,'' said Chicago's Commonwealth Edison spokesman 
Keith Bromery. ``That's put a real strain on the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While other states were able to avoid such problems, utilities  
issued warnings asking consumers to cut back on usage to prevent 
possible outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was so bad in central Arkansas that Danny Mahan, safety  
director for a construction company there, said workers pouring 
concrete have been going to work at about 3 a.m. to avoid the 
afternoon heat. He's been encouraging workers to drink plenty of 
water before they hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the younger guys think they can get a drink when it  
starts heating up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even pro athletes had trouble playing outdoors. In Chicago,  
Jimmy Connors withdrew from a seniors tennis tournament and two 
Cubs players took themselves out of a baseball game with the New 
York Mets because of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to quit. I called the trainer and said, `I can't  
take it,''' Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outages were the biggest worry in Chicago Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Several high-rise buildings with elderly were (partially)  
evacuated. Some of our cooling centers were down, and our 311 
number was overwhelmed by calls from people who couldn't get 
through to Commonwealth Edison and they wanted to report the 
outages,'' said city spokesman Terry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also made special efforts to get to the elderly, trying  
to avoid a repeat of the summer of 1995, when more than 700 elderly 
residents died in extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Police Officer Mike Sanders began the day checking to  
see how senior citizens were faring in the heat. He had to rescue 
81-year-old Mary Powls, lying on the floor of her apartment with 
her windows closed, fan off and no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders later checked on her in the hospital, where she was  
admitted in stable condition with a 104-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing that we came around when we did,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the elderly, intense heat can also be daunting for the  
homeless, if they have no shelter from the sun's rays. But in 
Louisville, Ky., which hit 106 on Friday, Bill Tracy has managed to 
find some places to keep cool during the day, such as the library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to keep myself dressed well so I can slip into  
places,'' said Tracy, who goes to a shelter at night.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Defends Austerity Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Determined to move his Social Democratic party to  
the political center, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged in an 
interview released Saturday to stick to his austerity plans and 
announced measures aimed at bringing leftist critics in line. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Der Spiegel newsmagazine, Schroeder cited  
polls showing public support for his 9-month-old government's 
efforts to balance the budget, yet ``uncertainty'' over whether he 
will be able to get the necessary cuts through parliament in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder accused old guard leftists of encouraging those doubts  
and hurting the government with constant carping over his plans to 
trim the welfare state and reduce business taxes, which he insists 
will encourage economic growth and help reduce the country's 10 
percent unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders and other leftists charge the austerity budget  
puts too much of the burden on the working-class and doesn't demand 
enough from industry and the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schroeder said a balanced budget can be reached ``without  
economizing so much that the social welfare state breaks down. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us want that, and none of us will do that,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder also said he planned to appoint a reformist ally,  
Transport Minister Franz Muentefering, to the task of lining up the 
party behind the government's course. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder took over as party chairman after Oskar Lafontaine,  
the left-wing's standard-bearer, quit in March, reportedly 
frustrated with Schroeder's more market-friendly approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have not talked since then, and Schroeder warned his  
former colleague, who is writing a book, not to ``throw stones at 
those doing the hard work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Muentefering, who ran last year's federal election campaign for  
the Social Democrats, is considered to have the backing as well of 
young party reformists, who recently accused party leaders of 
spending too much time on ``ideological navel-gazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an open letter, the 13 Social Democratic lawmakers called on  
their party to back pragmatic reforms, such as flexible labor 
markets and clamps on state spending, laid out recently by 
Schroeder and British Prime Minister Tony Blair in a joint 
manifesto for modernizing the left. 
</P>
<P>
	But parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse, one of the Social  
Democrats attacked in the letter, called on Schroeder not to stifle 
debate over the party's future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Criticism in a democracy is not insolent behavior,'' Focus  
newsmagazine quoted him as saying.

<HEADLINE> Ten Die in Michigan Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A plane carrying passengers  
on a weekend skydiving trip crashed early today, killing 10 people, 
state police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, which took off from Marine City Airport, broke into  
several pieces after it crashed just prior to 9 a.m., officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State police Trooper Raymond Volosky confirmed the crash later  
and said 10 were dead, but he would not confirm the total number of 
passengers aboard. A St. Clair County sheriff's dispatcher said 
early today that 10 people were aboard the craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials released no other details immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	Robert Franz, who lives nearby, said he heard the plane taking  
off -- and then he heard the engine go dead. A second or two later, 
he said, he heard a loud crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Franz says he grabbed his video camera and headed to the scene,  
about a half-mile away. He said the plane had crashed in an open 
field, and had broken into two sections. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the  
National Transportation Safety Board were en route to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Cottrellville Township is located about 40 miles north of  
Detroit.

<HEADLINE> Marley Vale Wins Test Stakes by 2 1/2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Marley Vale, ridden by John  
Velazquez, overtook the early speed as the field turned for home 
and drew off to a 2 1/2-length victory over Awful Smart in Saturday's 
$250,000 Test Stakes for 3-year-old fillies at Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	Awful Smart had speed early and late in a strong performance to  
be second in the 11-horse field, finishing a head better than the 
fast-closing Emanating. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughter of Forty Niner covered seven furlongs in 1:22 3-5  
to earn $150,000 for Eugene Melnyk. It was her fourth victory and 
ninth finish on the board in 10 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned $9.40, $5.70 and $4. Awful Smart paid $15.40 and  
$10.50 and Emanating was worth $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 3, Marley Vale ran second in the Prioress Stakes at  
Belmont Park, prompting trainer Todd Pletcher to say, ``I think it 
was a perfect prep for the Test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marley Vale confirmed her affinity for the Saratoga racing  
surface. She broke her maiden here last year after finishing second 
in her debut.

<HEADLINE> Tigers, Marlins Swap Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Florida Marlins and Detroit Tigers  
exchanged minor league pitching prospects Saturday night, with 
Florida sending right-hander Brandon Villafuerte to Detroit for 
right-hander Mike Drumright. 
</P>
<P>
	Drumright, 25, was the Tigers' first-round selection and the  
11th overall pick in the June 1995 draft, but has struggled with 
his control in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Wichita State teammate of Marlins reliever Braden  
Looper, the 6-foot-4 Drumright was 6-10 with a 5.97 ERA and 59 
walks in 120 2-3 innings at Triple-A Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a lot of pitchers scuffling in Triple-A, he needs to  
work on his command,'' Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski 
said. ``He has a big, strong pitcher's body who has thrown strikes 
in the past and has an above-average fastball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Villafuerte, 25, was 6-8 with a 3.50 ERA at Double-A Portland.  
He was originally acquired by Florida in the March 1998 deal that 
sent left-hander Al Leiter to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Drumright, who was on the Tigers' 40-man roster, was assigned to  
Triple-A Calgary. The Marlins also designated right-hander Archie 
Corbin for assignment and replaced him on the active roster with 
right-hander Rafael Medina from Triple-A Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Corbin was 0-1 with a 7.29 ERA in 17 appearances.

<HEADLINE> House Mulls Plan To Cut Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Dennis Hastert says he's  
seriously considering a plan that would take back billions of 
dollars given to the states to run their welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are searching for money to pay for a variety of  
programs. Despite projections of large budget surpluses, Congress 
must live within tight spending limits established in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to balance the budget,'' Hastert, R-Ill., told  
reporters Friday. Still, he admitted the dicey nature of taking 
back money already promised: ``We have a contract with the states, 
an agreement with the states.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, federal spending on welfare went up when more  
people signed up for welfare and dropped when welfare rolls fell. 
In 1996, Congress agreed to give states $16.5 billion each year no 
matter how many people are on welfare. States took the financial 
risk if caseloads went up and they needed extra money to write more 
benefit checks. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turns out, welfare rolls have dropped further and faster  
than anyone predicted, to a 30-year low. As a result, states have 
more money to spend per person than ever before, and they have $4.2 
billion left unspent in their federal accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	That money has proven tempting to congressional budget writers,  
who are also considering cuts to child support and Medicaid 
funding. State governors, never happy about cuts in federal money, 
are lobbying heavily against each of the potential cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans argue the states have plenty of money plus  
significant new power to run welfare and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the best relationship with the nation's governors  
that (Congress) has ever had,'' said Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio. 
States should realize, he suggested, they can't always get their 
way. ``There's got to be some balance in this relationship. It 
can't be all one way. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the tough decisions we have to make,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP leaders have argued against taking back the money, an  
idea that periodically comes up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a deal,'' House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill  
Archer, R-Texas, wrote to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., in the spring. ``As state legislatures confront the 
toughest challenges of welfare reform, Congress is proposing to 
pull the rug from under them.''

<HEADLINE> Social Security Surplus Untouchable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just about drowned out by the partisan warfare  
in Congress over the Republicans' tax-cutting drive is one of the 
most dramatic and beneficial budget achievements in years: a 
bipartisan truce over two-thirds of the federal surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's dominant battle is over how to use $1 trillion in  
projected surpluses over the next decade. Republicans favor tax 
cuts and President Clinton and Democrats prefer domestic spending. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a little-heralded development, an additional $1.9  
trillion in anticipated surpluses expected from Social Security has 
become politically untouchable for both sides. Each party has 
pledged to leave the money alone, and can grab for it only at risk 
of being accused by opponents of stealing Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they've trapped themselves,'' said Robert Bixby,  
policy director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that 
advocates budget frugality. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, the politicians have already nibbled at the Social Security  
money, using it, for instance, to pay for the bombing campaign 
against Yugoslavia. Yes, they undoubtedly will do so again, 
probably this fall when a likely agreement between Clinton and 
Republicans will result in billions more for schools, agriculture, 
defense and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	And yes, 10-year projections are always shaky and actual  
surpluses could end up being far smaller than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither side's grand budget plans envision using that  
enormous $1.9 trillion Social Security kitty for tax cuts or 
spending, a new and major development. 
</P>
<P>
	That means most of the money is likely to go to reduce the  
national debt. Economists from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan on down say that is the best thing to do with it because 
reducing the debt lowers interest rates and energizes the economy 
in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if lawmakers dissipate the entire $1 trillion surplus from  
non-Social Security programs, ``we'd have still paid down a 
substantial portion of the debt and achieved something that was 
unthinkable two years ago,'' said Robert Reischauer, senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recent months, neither party hesitated to use Social  
Security surpluses to pay for tax or spending initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	But that all changed last year, when Clinton -- looking to  
prevent Republicans from using the surpluses for a tax cut -- 
thought up his ``save Social Security first'' mantra. It was 
shorthand for not using the Social Security surpluses for tax cuts 
or spending, and it proved to have such undeniable political appeal 
that Republicans embraced it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this year, something else happened. The surging economy has  
poured so much revenue into the federal government that projected 
surpluses have sprouted on the non-Social Security side of the 
budget, something unseen for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	That made the virtuous-sounding pledge to leave Social Security  
money alone painless as well because it turned out there was still 
$1 trillion in projected surpluses to play with. 
</P>
<P>
	``This couldn't have happened without a very rapid and  
unexpected improvement in the budget outlook,'' Reischauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	First Republicans, then Democrats have tried scoring political  
points by trumpeting the need for a so-called lock box. That is 
legislation that would allegedly make it harder for lawmakers to 
use the Social Security surpluses for anything but shoring up the 
program or reducing the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	But politicians always find a way around such devices, and  
nothing has been enacted yet anyway. Yet, the political will to 
avoid angering senior citizens by being seen as raiding Social 
Security may suffice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every politician in America has heard from senior citizens  
saying, 'Why are you robbing my Social Security,''' said Richard 
May, a former GOP House budget aide who is now a consultant in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest question is what politicians will do if a severe  
recession or some other unforeseen event erases the projected 
surpluses. Will they then propose using Social Security funds for 
higher spending or tax cuts? 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're out on that sand bar now, and if the tide  
comes in they're stuck,'' said Bixby.

<HEADLINE> House Supports Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has boosted the chances that  
Congress will approve legislation requiring background checks on 
all firearms sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks after rejecting tougher gun control restrictions  
supported by the Senate, the House approved, 305-84, a nonbinding 
measure Friday endorsing background checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after House leaders named their participants in  
negotiations with the Senate to resolve differences between House 
and Senate bills toughening penalties against teen-age offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure asks negotiators to write a compromise juvenile  
justice bill that would require background checks for all firearms 
sales at gun shows. Under current law, background checks are 
required only on sales by licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution also calls for including measures to prevent  
violence in schools and ensuring that the legislation does not 
weaken existing gun regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although House negotiators are not required to follow those  
instructions, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., the House Judiciary 
Committee's top Democrat, said the vote was a repudiation of the 
National Rifle Association, which has lobbied against new gun 
control laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``With today's vote, more than 300 of my colleagues finally  
joined the majority of the Senate in showing the courage to take on 
the NRA and enact tough bans on criminal purchases at gun shows, 
the biggest single loophole in our nation's gun safety laws,'' 
Conyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was particularly important, he said, because it came a  
day after a mass shooting in Atlanta. Investigators say Mark O. 
Barton shot nine people to death at two brokerage firms on Thursday 
after killing his wife and two children earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the tragedy should put more pressure on  
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this leadership doesn't act and doesn't pass commonsense  
gun legislation, they are going to have to explain to the American 
public why the NRA has more influence over them than all the 
mothers and fathers and children of this country,'' Rep. Nita 
Lowey, D-N.Y., said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., said provisions in the  
House bill that would toughen penalties against teen-age criminals 
would help reduce school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This legislation will not solve every problem, but it will  
take steps to make our schools safer,'' he said in a statement. ``I 
hope our Democrat colleagues put the good of the country in front 
of partisanship as we proceed with this issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats said they were pleased to see action on  
legislation that could result in tighter restrictions on gun 
ownership, but they still accused Republicans of obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's move. We are tired of seeing delay. We are tired of  
seeing stonewalling,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. ``We also 
realize and understand that they have dragged their feet on this, 
putting it off until the last week. I don't know what they're 
hoping for, because it's not going away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill, in addition to requiring background checks on  
all firearms buyers at gun shows, would require dealers to provide 
safety devices with all handguns, ban importation of certain 
high-capacity firearms clips and impose a lifetime prohibition of 
gun ownership by anyone convicted as a juvenile of a serious 
felony.

<HEADLINE> Mariners Activate Tom Davey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners on Saturday added 6-foot-7  
right-hander Tom Davey to their 25-man roster and optioned 
right-hander Ken Cloude to Triple-A Tacoma for the second time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Davey, 25, was acquired along with left-hander Steve Sinclair in  
a trade with Toronto on Wednesday for first baseman David Segui. 
</P>
<P>
	Davey reported to the Mariners on Saturday. He immediately was  
added to the team's bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	Davey split this season between the Blue Jays and Triple-A  
Syracuse, going 1-1 with one save and a 4.70 ERA with Toronto 
before he was sent down June 28. He was 1-2 with a 3.48 ERA at 
Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloude, 24, has been a major disappointment for the Mariners  
this season. He began the season at Tacoma. In 26 games, including 
four starts, in Seattle, he had a 3-4 record and a 7.84 ERA in 59 
2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloude was an eight-game winner in 30 starts for the Mariners  
last season.

<HEADLINE> GOP Braces for Battle on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans are moving  
quickly to join forces for the coming battle against the White 
House over the size and scope of the tax cut they hope to present 
to the American people in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Friday approved a $792 billion tax plan that  
mirrors an earlier House-passed bill in size but differs in the 
kinds of tax relief included. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43, mostly along party lines.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said repeatedly he would veto the GOP  
plans because they are three times what he thinks the economy can 
safely digest amid efforts to ensure the solvency of Social 
Security and Medicare and pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate made the wrong choice for America's future,''  
Clinton said in a statement Friday. ``By pushing through a tax plan 
that is too big and too bloated, the majority party has pushed 
aside our vital national priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said congressional  
tax specialists would begin talks as early as today, and that a 
House-Senate conference could be held early next week to pave the 
way for final passage of a compromise plan at week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some urgency because Congress recesses at the end of  
the week for its month-long summer vacation. But Lott indicated the 
final bill would not be sent to the president until Congress 
returns in September, avoiding a veto while lawmakers are away from 
Washington and giving them a chance to make their case to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the American people understand what we  
have done,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M. ``We'd like to get our message across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott began that message campaign today in the weekly Republican  
radio address. With the federal budget projected to show a $3.4 
trillion surplus in the next decade, he asked, ``shouldn't you be 
able to keep more of what you earn, for your household needs, or to 
save for your family's future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't selfish to want lower taxes. You know your family  
pays too much for government. I know it. And so does the president. 
But he wants that cash for spending here in Washington,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and most Democrats say that if Social Security  
revenues are put aside, the surplus amounts to about $1 trillion, 
and the GOP plans would put nearly all of that into tax cuts -- 
ignoring education, defense and other programs and doing little to 
fix Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP course ``can best be characterized as one of both  
wishful thinking and fiscal disaster,'' said Senate Democratic 
leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The main elements of the Senate plan include a reduction in the  
bottom 15 percent income tax bracket to 14 percent and expansion of 
the number of taxpayers eligible for that bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase the standard deduction for married couples in  
2001 and allow those couples to file returns as singles in a 
combined form starting in 2005. That would help to eliminate 
situations in which married people pay more than singles because 
their combined incomes forces them into a higher bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would raise the exemption for estate taxes from  
$1 million to $1.5 million in 2007 and raise annual contribution 
limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference in the House bill is that it provides for an  
across-the-board 10 percent cut in tax rates. It also cuts the top 
capital gains tax rate for most investments held at least a year 
from 20 percent to 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who backed a failed attempt to include an across-the-board  
cut in the Senate bill, said he wasn't sure the House-Senate 
conference would move in that direction, but ``if it were that or 
anything else in this bill I'd take that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Democrats -- Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Mary Landrieu  
and John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- voted for 
the GOP plan, while Republicans Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and 
George Voinovich of Ohio opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, who earlier backed an unsuccessful attempt by  
Democratic and Republican moderates to push a $500 billion tax cut, 
said he thought that approach would eventually prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the political script gets played out, the bipartisan  
plan will serve as a blueprint for an October solution that bridges 
the divergent positions on tax cuts,'' he said.

	Slightly cooler weather began to edge into the Midwest on  
Saturday, bringing rain and storms to several states. But heat and 
humidity continued to be a problem for much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Deadly high temperatures and humidity continued its reign over  
much of the country, with the nation's death toll over 140. Records 
fell in North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia as 
temperatures easily broke 100 in the South and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was some relief, as sporadically heavy rain and  
thunderstorms swept through parts of Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, 
Kansas, and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Coastal and southern New England began with heavy fog, though  
that burned away to clear skies as in much of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Scattered showers fell in southern Florida and southeastern  
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloudy skies covered much of the Rockies, including Wyoming,  
Utah, Colorado and parts of Montana. Scattered showers fell in 
northeastern Colorado and southwestern Wyoming. The rest of the 
West was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures by early afternoon Saturday in the lower 48 states  
ranged from a high heat index of 121 in Mary Esther, Fla., to a low 
of 33 in Stanley, Idaho.

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Houston Astros placed catcher Tony Eusebio  
on the 15-day disabled list Saturday with a strained left 
hamstring.

<P>
	Knorr made three starts, going 1-for-13. He was batting .337  
with 13 doubles, eight homers and 31 RBIs for New Orleans.

<HEADLINE>  Cohen Offers U.S. Aid to Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARTENIT, Ukraine (AP) -- The United States and Ukraine agreed  
Saturday to extend for another six years a program helping the 
former Soviet republic dismantle its ballistic missiles and nuclear 
weapons infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
	Visiting Defense Secretary William Cohen also promised aid to  
Ukraine to fund its peacekeeping contingent for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen announced the extension of the Cooperative Threat  
Reduction Program, saying the decision testified to Ukraine's 
commitment to nuclear disarmament and the two countries' growing 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have more than 100 separate programs and our  
relationship continues to expand,'' Cohen told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine inherited the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal with  
the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, but pledged to become 
nuclear-free. It surrendered all its nuclear warheads to Russia, 
and was left with 130 SS-19 missiles, 46 SS-24 missiles and more 
than 40 Tu-160s and Tu-95 MC strategic bombers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has contributed more than $500 million under  
the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to help Ukraine dismantle 
the weapons. The program was initiated in 1991 to promote nuclear 
disarmament in the former Soviet Union. The Ukrainian part was 
slated to expire in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ukraine has destroyed all of its SS-19 missiles and their launch  
silos, one SS-24 silo and one bomber under the program. 
</P>
<P>
	But observers say cash-poor Ukraine has been lagging in  
destroying the rest of its nuclear arsenal because of money 
problems, prompting the six-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen arrived on Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula of Crimea for a  
whirlwind visit Saturday. He traveled to Foros, a resort where 
President Leonid Kuchma was vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense secretary's convoy stopped to pay respects to a  
memorial to British soldiers killed in the Crimean War of the 
1850s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Kuchma and parliament approved the deployment of up  
to 800 soldiers in Kosovo. Kuchma said at the time that NATO had 
agreed to finance the soldiers' transportation and housing costs 
while Ukraine would pay their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Cohen said: ``We intend to contribute to a  
peacekeeping effort on the part of Ukraine. We will seek 
contribution from other NATO countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Oleksandr Martynenko quoted Cohen as  
saying that financial details would be worked out during an 
upcoming visit by the alliance's deputy commander of armed forces 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's meeting with Kuchma also touched upon bilateral military  
cooperation, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and 
military reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Ukrainian armed forces are undergoing a complicated  
process of reform and the assistance of the U.S. defense ministry 
is very important for us,'' Ukrainian news reports quoted Kuchma as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	In meetings with Kuchma, Kuzmuk and other officials, Cohen also  
promised further assistance to Ukraine in military training, in 
particular peacekeepers, Martynenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also met with Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk  
during a separate meeting near Partenit, a village 60 miles from 
the port of Sevastopol. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's visit to Ukraine was part of a tour that also included  
visits to Japan and South Korea. He left Saturday evening for the 
former Soviet republic of Georgia, the final leg of his trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen last visited Ukraine in July 1997.

<HEADLINE> Farm Economy Not All Gloom and Doom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The problems in the agricultural economy would  
seem far removed from John E. Miller's farm in the Arkansas Ozarks. 
Miller is turning out chickens as fast as his buyer, Conagra Inc., 
can take them -- probably 2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stable business, the chicken business. ... The demand  
has been strong,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is not alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and other field crops have  
slumped to lows not seen by farmers in years. But government 
subsidies have softened the impact and much of the agricultural 
economy is relatively healthy, nowhere close to its perilous state 
during the farm crisis of the early 1980s, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest economic forecast, the Agriculture Department  
projects net farm income to dip to $43.8 billion this year, down 
slightly from last year and off 3.7 percent of the 
inflation-adjusted average for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some sectors in agriculture where our income and  
revenue have continued to rise in the last couple of years -- 
poultry, dairy, fruits, vegetables, nursery and greenhouse 
products. They just seem to trend upward,'' said Keith Collins, 
USDA's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the low commodity prices, federal farm subsidies are  
expected to reach a near-record $16.6 billion this year. That total 
does not include any emergency aid Congress is likely to approve 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is set to debate a farm-economy bailout this week  
that could reach $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the Arkansas poultry farmer, is unlikely to benefit. As  
with most federal farm aid, virtually all of the money would go to 
grain and cotton growers because fruits, vegetables, livestock and 
poultry receive little if any federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall financial position of farmers is relatively sound,  
according to USDA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Average farm equity, adjusted for inflation, is up 1 percent  
from 1998 and has risen 50 percent since the mid-1980s, when 
skyrocketing interest rates and huge grain surpluses sent farmland 
values plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm debt is down 12 percent since 1984 and declined slightly  
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't see a 1980s-type crisis'' this year, said Collins.  
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Dick  
Lugar, R-Ind., is trying to slow the rush in Congress to pass a 
large bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sending his colleagues a series of mailings pointing out  
how much the government is already doing for growers. Among other 
things, the government guarantees farmers a minimum return for 
their crops no matter how low prices go. This year those subsidies 
are expected to total $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding that ``emotions are understandably running high  
from areas in our country where farmers are hurting,'' whatever 
Congress does to help them should be based on an ``assessment of 
actual farm income needs,'' Lugar said in one letter. ``Rural 
America deserves no less. Taxpayers expect as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats are proposing $10 billion in emergency aid, and  
Republicans are working on a package of between $7 billion and $10 
billion. Sen. Tom Harkin, who is leading the Democratic effort, 
says many farmers will go out of business unless they get 
additional help soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farm families and rural communities are in the worst economic  
crisis of at least a decade, and perhaps since the Great 
Depression,'' said Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall economic numbers mask the problems facing many  
farmers who grow grain and cotton. Cash receipts for soybeans are 
expected to fall 17 percent this year, 11 percent for wheat, 10 
percent for cotton, and 9 percent for corn. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, cash receipts for broiler chickens, Miller's  
business, are holding steady this year and are up more than 25 
percent over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland values are down 6 percent in Illinois this year and 3  
percent in Indiana and Iowa, according to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Chicago. In parts of the region the drop is greater -- 11 percent 
in central Iowa, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Lugar, Congress' most prominent farmer, acknowledges that  
income from his 600-acre corn and soybean operation in Indiana 
dropped 18 percent last year from 1997. He does not expect this 
year to be any better. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is a worldwide glut of grain.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm law was supposed to prevent price-depressing  
surpluses of U.S. grain and other crops by scaling back on 
production-based subsidies, but prices fell anyway because of 
strong crops worldwide and economic problems in Asia and Russia.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Southern Mississippi baseball player  
Michael Artman, who set a school record with 106 hits this past 
season, was diagnosed with testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Artman, a first baseman and center fielder, was released from  
Baptist Medical Center in Jackson on Friday and will begin 
chemotherapy this week. 
</P>
<P>
	His doctor is optimistic about his treatment and playing future.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said there's a strong possibility Michael will be able to  
play ball this spring,'' said Dan Artman, Michael's father. 
``Michael is pretty strong. I haven't heard a negative thing from 
him. He's had a lot of people calling, a lot of coaches and 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testicular cancer is treatable when detected in the early  
stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Bicyclist Lance Armstrong, the 1993 world road race champion,  
won Tour de France this month after learning in October 1996 that 
he had testicular cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Artman, who batted .408 and finished the season with a 20-game  
hitting streak, was diagnosed with cancer when he came home to 
Jackson on a break from playing summer baseball in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old junior helped lead Southern Miss to a 40-23  
record and its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1991.

<HEADLINE> 21 Hurt in Illinois Bus Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Twenty-one people were injured, some  
critically, after a car slammed into the back of a small bus and 
caused it to tip over, ejecting several passengers, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus passengers were heading to work at a factory when the  
accident occurred about 10 p.m. Friday on Interstate 355 in 
suburban Chicago, said Master Sgt. Luis Tigera of the Illinois 
state police. The bus hit a pole before it tipped over. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers were being transported by an employment agency to  
work an overnight shift at TDI Batteries in Downers Grove. They 
were coming from Cicero. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the passengers were Spanish-speaking, making it  
difficult for authorities to find out immediately what happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's driver was among those injured. At least 15 people  
were taken to hospitals. Six had life-threatening injuries, said 
Sue Sullivan, a nursing supervisor at Good Samaritan Hospital. 
</P>

	Several lanes of the highway remained closed while officers  
cleared the scene.

<HEADLINE> Dow Seeks To Ban Punitive Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAY CITY, Mich. (AP) -- A federal bankruptcy judge said Friday he  
will focus on whether Dow Corning Corp.'s corporate parents should 
remain immune to lawsuits as part of a $4.5 billion settlement over 
silicone breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning is owned equally by Dow Chemical Corp. and Corning  
Corp. Judge Arthur Spector said the heart of the settlement is the 
question of immunity for the two. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plan is illegal, it's unconstitutional, it's unauthorized  
and it's in bad faith under the (bankruptcy) code,'' attorney 
Geoffrey White, an attorney for several Nevada women, said during 
the last day of a hearing into the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Spector also requested lawyers to submit more briefs on the  
question of punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the debtor's product didn't cause these people's diseases  
... then they shouldn't have to pay anything,'' he said. ``If they 
did cause diseases or syndromes, then until they have no more money 
they should pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Midland-based company filed for bankruptcy in 1995 after  
thousands of women started suing, claiming breast implants of Dow 
Corning silicone caused a variety of diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Spector didn't say when his ruling might come. If he doesn't  
confirm the plan, a new settlement would have to be drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, women who blame illnesses on  
implants could get $12,000 to $300,000 each. They could also 
receive up to $25,000 for ruptured or leaking implants, and up to 
$5,000 for implant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	It provides $3.2 billion to settle claims from women with  
implants and an additional $1.3 billion to settle other claims, 
including claims from creditors and health-care organizations. The 
company would set aside up to $400 million to cover any costs of 
defending lawsuits by women who reject the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 113,000 women voted on the settlement terms earlier this  
year, and 94 percent approved.

Albanians on Serbs for the killings, rapes and forced removals that

<HEADLINE> Bush Stumps in New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONWAY, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush glad-handed the nation's  
first primary voters Saturday, ignoring sweltering heat, a 
commanding lead in the polls and pundits who say voters aren't 
ready in midsummer to pick a president. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, the Republican front-runner is did what  
activists believe candidates must do to win the first-in-the-nation 
primary: shake hands, kiss babies, flip hamburgers at cookouts. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also avoiding the miscues that threatened his father's New  
Hampshire race in 1988, when the senior George Bush, then vice 
president, appeared aloof until advisers changed strategies to 
assure more mix-and-mingle with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are for me, thank you for your vote,'' he told a crowd  
that greeted him in Conway, a tourist town in the White Mountains. 
``If you haven't made up your mind, give me a good look. If you are 
for someone else, that's OK. Don't work too hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush was greeted in Conway by up to 500 people, many of them  
from out of state, on the first of several stops. More than 1,000 
turned out to see him in Wolfeboro and a few hundred attended a 
block party in Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's received so much publicity, I wanted to see if there  
really is a man behind all of the money he's raised,'' said Paul 
Hauth, 24. Hauth said he also attended the rally because, although 
he voted as a Democrat in 1996, ``This last president has made me 
more conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some who attended said they already know Bush has their vote.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like the man. I like his father. I adore his mother,'' said  
Republican Marilyn MacAllister, 68. She said Bush speaks well, 
seems sincere and is likely to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Conway 68-year-old, Linda Stetson, said she won't vote  
for Bush but came to see him because she thinks he will be the next 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush pushed familiar themes in speaking to the crowd, saying  
America's prosperity has to be for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of prosperity is to make sure no one is left  
behind,'' he said. ``The American dream shines brightly for a lot 
of us, but too many say, `The dream isn't for me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush waited months before finally visiting New Hampshire last  
month. He let his popularity build from afar among Republicans 
hungry to back a winner, then stepped into a limelight envied by 
his competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor can afford to set his own pace. He's leading  
by 30 to 40 points in the latest polls and has $37 million in the 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	His competitors aren't conceding victory six months before the  
first vote is cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Fleischer, spokesman for Elizabeth Dole, said: ``He has a  
lead in the second inning in a nine-inning game. He's got the 
money. The question is can he go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire pollster Kelly Myers, with RKM Research and  
Communication, says candidates must remain visible now even if the 
public is only half paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Voters believe that the candidates have to be accessible,''  
agrees fellow New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett of American 
Research Group. ``It doesn't matter if they actually get to see 
(Bush). They want to know he's around.''

	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Shortstop Chris Gomez, who missed 52 games  
after undergoing double knee surgery, was activated Saturday night 
by the San Diego Padres and started against the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez took the roster spot vacated when the Padres traded  
utilityman Jim Leyritz to the New York Yankees for a minor league 
pitcher earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez was recalled from a 10-game rehabilitation assignment to  
Class AAA Las Vegas, where he hit .333 with four RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez, bothered by knee pain most of the season, underwent  
arthroscopic surgery on June 4 to repair a small cartilage tear in 
his left knee and had rough cartilage smoothed in both joints. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez was hitting .222 with no homers and three RBIs before  
going on the DL on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Damian Jackson, who had made several starts at shortstop  
before Gomez went on the DL, started all but one game while Gomez 
was out.

	Bolero Master, who left from the rail in the eight-horse field,  
was second after a quarter-mile and was third when the field 
crossed the finish line the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Still third after three-quarters of a mile, Bolero Master caught  
Island Fantasy at the top of the stretch and held on by a 
quarter-length. Justanotherpoorboy was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolero Master returned $19.80, $6.70 and $3.60.

<HEADLINE> McCain Promises Help for Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, S.C. (AP) -- GOP Sen. John McCain met with hundreds of  
veterans during his weekend campaign tour of South Carolina before 
he ran into one who shared a very special bond with the former 
Vietnam POW running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	James William ``Billy'' Bailey, a 56-year-old school  
administrator from Anderson, was in the same North Vietnamese 
prison camp at the same time as McCain and turned out Saturday to 
lend support. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a man of integrity and honesty. I think he's the best man  
qualified to run for president,'' Bailey said after greeting McCain 
outside the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	At stops along his route, McCain addressed small but  
enthusiastic crowds about how money has corrupted the political 
process in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	He told audiences usually jammed with veterans about how the  
federal government must provide veterans' health care benefits and 
pay enlisted men and women enough to keep them off food stamps. 
Then he answered as many questions as his schedule allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, R-Ariz., also criticized both Democrats and Republicans  
for their allegiance to special interests and big money. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these huge amounts of money make good people do bad  
things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's ``Straight Talk Express'' bus tour started Friday and  
was to last four days. It is McCain's ninth visit to South 
Carolina, which holds its primary Feb. 19. He is splitting his 
campaign time between New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he is 
the most active GOP candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``South Carolina will be a pivotal state as it was in 1996,'' he  
told a television interviewer Saturday in Greenville. ``South 
Carolina is the gateway to the Republican nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Texas Gov. George W. Bush holds a huge lead in the  
polls and fund raising, the atmosphere on the McCain campaign bus 
is loose and upbeat. The tone is set by the 62-year-old McCain, who 
keeps up a steady stream of one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked on the bus how his campaign is going, McCain quipped:  
``It's always darkest before it's totally black.'' He quickly added 
he is pleased with the progress his campaign has made, both in fund 
raising and key polls. A recent poll in New Hampshire showed him 
far behind Bush, but with numbers that had climbed from 3 percent 
to the low teens. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign aides say he should have the money and campaign  
organization to compete with Bush effectively in New Hampshire and 
South Carolina, which both have limited media markets. Political 
analysts say Bush will have an advantage in organization and 
establishment support in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's campaign has raised $8.1 million and has almost $5  
million in cash, aides say. He said he has not faced the financial 
drought other candidates face because Bush has raised almost $40 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain is not competing in the Aug. 14 Iowa straw poll, saying  
straw polls are a waste of resources. But his advisers say they 
will discuss in the fall what level of effort they will put into 
the Iowa caucus, the initial step in the GOP selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	The key for McCain, advisers say, is to be competitive in the  
New Hampshire primary and be positioned to derail Bush's 
front-running campaign in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompany McCain on the bus tour are his wife, Cindy, and U.S.  
Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford of South Carolina. The tour 
features a mix of stops for broadcast interviews and small rallies 
populated largely by military veterans. South Carolina has one of 
the nation's highest concentrations of veterans -- more than 
400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said McCain is a good match with South Carolina voters.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once people look and listen, he will do well,'' Graham said.  
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who comes from a family with a rich military tradition,  
was a POW in the Vietnam War for more than five years. He hopes to 
build a base of veteran support in South Carolina and attract 
disaffected voters who like his message on government reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need a genuine American hero right now,'' said  
Billy Hudgens, a Greenwood insurance agent who came to a McCain 
event. ``I believe he has inner strength. It's evident from his 
wartime experience. He's willing to stand up to people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was asked by reporters on the bus why he was putting so  
much effort into the South Carolina primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the greatness of its citizens,'' he said, then  
grinned as he added: ``And its position on the political 
calendar.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Claims 100 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chicago authorities said Saturday that as many as 46 more  
residents have died as a result of the relentless heat wave that 
enveloped much of the nation Saturday and produced the hottest July 
on record in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, where the temperature hit 99 degrees this week,  
Mayor Richard Daley confirmed there were 26 deaths tied to the heat 
and humidity Friday and Saturday. Another 20 deaths were possibly 
linked to the sticky weather, the mayor said; autopsies were 
planned on those victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois had already reported 23 heat-related deaths since July  
21. Daley urged Chicago residents to check on relatives and 
friends, particularly those who were elderly or ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could save their life,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, more than 700 elderly Chicagoans died in extreme heat.  
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where temperatures had climbed above 90 for the  
last eight days, the thermometer ``only'' hit 88 degrees in Central 
Park. So ended the hottest July in New York City history. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were predicting that the first few days of August  
would offer some much-needed relief to the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutal heat extended far beyond those two cities. Around the  
country, soaring temperatures were blamed for more than 100 deaths; 
one of the most recent was a North Carolina migrant farm worker 
whose body temperature hit 108 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri reported three new heat deaths Saturday, bringing the  
total there to 32 this month. All of the victims, including two 
senior citizens, lived alone and did not have air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the eastern two-thirds of North Carolina soared  
into triple digits Saturday for a record-setting eighth time this 
year. The 104-degree reading at Raleigh-Durham International 
Airport broke the 1983 mark of seven. 
</P>
<P>
	From Wisconsin to Texas to western Pennsylvania, temperatures of  
90-plus were expected on Saturday. The nation's high on Friday was 
in Hobart, Okla., where the temperature hit 108. 
</P>
<P>
	In Burlington, Vt., the record temperature of 92 was in danger  
by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like being in a sauna,'' said Jeni Humphries, who was  
selling groceries at a farmer's market in Montpelier, Vt. ``Though 
in a sauna, you can just sit there, and in this you have to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little respite on Saturday for New York City, when  
temperatures threatened to top 90 degrees for the ninth straight 
day and the 18th time in 31 days this month. By 1 p.m., the 
temperature was already at 88 in Central Park; in Morristown, N.J., 
it was at 93. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service extended its heat advisory, warning  
that the combination of heat and humidity would lift the heat index 
to about 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, thunderstorms and a cold front should finally bring  
temperatures into the 80s for New York and its suburbs, said 
National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Personally, I'm looking forward to turning off the air  
conditioning and opening all the windows at home,'' said Reynolds, 
echoing the thoughts of many overheated New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
	But the heat wave was not limited to the East Coast. In  
Wisconsin, temperatures climbed above 100 degrees in some areas. On 
Friday night, severe thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70 mph 
toppled trees, downed power lines and killed two people. 
</P>
<P>
	In western Pennsylvania, temperatures hit the mid-90s, with the  
heat index in Pittsburgh expected to hit 105 degrees. In 
Philadelphia, the mercury was expected to approach 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in Texas and parts of the Southeast and Southwest  
were expected to approach 100 degrees on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, it wasn't just hot -- it was dry, too. Rain has  
become a dim memory. 
</P>
<P>
	The city received only .44 inches of rain this month -- about the  
equivalent of two good thunderstorms, said Reynolds. It was the 
driest July ever in New York, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous winner for hottest July was 1995, when the average  
temperature was just above 80 degrees. July 1999 had an average 
temperature above 81 degrees -- more than four degrees above the 
usual temperature for this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Reynolds said the seemingly endless hot spell could come to  
an end as early as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should get a break, finally,'' he said. ``A cold front is  
coming through Sunday afternoon or evening, and hopefully most of 
the area will get some rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While air conditioners cranked and utilities struggled to keep  
up with power demands, there were only scattered reports of power 
outages. On Long Island, about 4,000 people lost power this 
weekend; by Saturday, all but a few hundred had their electricity 
back.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Revised Farm Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Current law shortchanges American farmers when  
times are tough, and Congress should act to ``fix the underlying 
problem'' rather than dealing with crises as they happen, President 
Clinton said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm law, which ended a Depression-era system of price  
supports based on production levels, ``simply does not do enough to 
help our farmers and ranchers cope in hard times,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many American farmers are mired in their worst economic times in  
more than a decade. Abundant crops at home and in many places 
abroad and sharp economic downturns in traditional overseas markets 
have brought a worldwide glut and extremely low prices for many 
commodities. In many areas, drought has exacerbated problems this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	In a message taped for broadcast in farm states, Clinton said he  
has done what he can, including buying more food for humanitarian 
aid around the world, accelerating farm program payments and 
providing $6 billion in emergency aid last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But under the 1996 law, Clinton said, neither the president nor  
the Agriculture Department has ``the tools we need to help farmers 
and ranchers thrive over the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said what is needed is authority to augment incomes of  
hurting farmers in bad years, to improve crop insurance and make it 
and easier to obtain and to expand markets abroad and police market 
practices at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``To really help our farmers and ranchers, we have to fix the  
underlying problem,'' Clinton said. ``That's the right way to help 
our farmers and ranchers over the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is committed to work with Congress ``to provide the  
resources to help our farmers and ranchers by dealing with today's 
crisis and by fixing the Farm Bill for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Republicans in Congress have refused to tamper with the  
1996 law, called ``Freedom to Farm,'' despite Democratic demands to 
rewrite it as farmers' late-1990s problems grew. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm state Democrats proposed in the Senate a $10 billion  
bailout last week and want a vote on the package this week before 
lawmakers break for summer vacation. Republican leaders are working 
on a measure of their own, expected to reach $7 billion to $10 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm groups are asking for up to $17 billion in aid this year.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Claims 133 Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Twenty-six more people have died from the heat in  
Chicago, pushing Illinois' heat-related death toll to 49 and the 
nation's casualties far beyond 100, even as Saturday brought a 
glimpse of cool to parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	An additional 20 deaths in Chicago may be heat-related and were  
under investigation, Mayor Richard Daley said, announcing the 
latest deaths from the heat wave that scorched much of the nation 
and produced New York City's hottest July on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest deaths in Chicago on Friday and Saturday brought the  
nation's heat-related death toll to 133 since July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	``This heat is some serious stuff, man,'' said George Wilder  
Jr., a security guard working downtown who took the day off Friday 
to check on his 85-year-old grandmother. ``She's doing fine. I'm 
glad, because I only have one grandmother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago hit 99 degrees during the week, though by Saturday a  
front moving through the region lowered temperatures to the 80s. 
Despite the cooler weather, Daley urged residents to check on 
relatives and friends, particularly those who were elderly or ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could save their life,'' he said. In 1995, more than 700  
elderly Chicagoans died in extreme heat. Daley warned that more 
deaths may be discovered in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the East continued to sizzle, with Philadelphia peaking  
at 99 degrees on Saturday, making it the ninth straight day above 
90 degrees, and soaring temperatures in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, where temperatures had climbed above 90 for the  
last eight days, the thermometer ``only'' hit 88 degrees in Central 
Park. So ended the hottest July in New York City history. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters were predicting that the first few days of August  
would offer some much-needed relief to the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutal heat stretched across much of the nation. In more  
than a dozen states, people were found dead in homes and apartments 
without air-conditioning or fans. One of the most recent was a 
North Carolina migrant farm worker whose body temperature hit 108 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri reported nine new heat deaths Saturday, bringing the  
total there to 38. Most of those who died were elderly and had air 
conditioning but didn't use it because they were worried about high 
utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures in the eastern two-thirds of North Carolina soared  
into triple digits Saturday for a record-setting eighth time this 
year. The 104-degree reading at Raleigh-Durham International 
Airport broke the 1983 mark of seven days over 100 degrees in a 
year. It also broke the high temperature for the day, last set in 
1953 at 102. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina  
hit a record high of 104; Parkersburg, W.Va., was at 102; and 
Columbus, Ohio and Columbus, Ind., both reached 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia reached 99 Saturday, making it the ninth straight  
day above 90. The nation's high on Friday was in Hobart, Okla., 
where the temperature hit 108. 
</P>
<P>
	In Burlington, Vt., the record temperature of 92 was in danger  
by early afternoon. 
</P>

	``It's like being in a sauna,'' said Jeni Humphries, who was  
selling groceries at a farmer's market in Montpelier, Vt. ``Though 
in a sauna, you can just sit there, and in this you have to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, temperatures climbed above 100 degrees in some  
areas. On Friday night, severe thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 
70 mph toppled trees, downed power lines and killed two people. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, the temperatures reached 103 in Abilene reached and  
105 in Childress, in northwest section of the state, readings 
typical for this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilder, the Chicago security guard, said he followed the advice  
to drink lots of fluids. But he does more than drink water to keep 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe as many showers as I can,'' he said. ``It really  
works. Not just for old people. For anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, thunderstorms and a cold front should finally bring  
temperatures into the 80s for New York and its suburbs, said 
National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Reynolds.

<HEADLINE> China Sect Claims Sites Under Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A crackdown by Chinese authorities on the Falun  
Gong meditation group has apparently spread to Web sites in the 
United States and elsewhere, with at least one ``hacking'' attempt 
that appeared to trace back to the Chinese national police bureau 
in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Managers of Web sites devoted to Falun Gong said Friday that the  
sites are coming under heavy electronic attack. China banned the 
meditation group last week, accusing it of trying to develop 
political power. Falun Gong leaders have denied any political 
ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chinese state media have cited the group's Internet presence  
as proof that it is well-organized and not just made up of harmless 
meditation buffs. A government ban on Falun Gong publications 
includes electronic publications, and nearly all of Falun Gong Web 
sites in China have been shut down since the ban was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob McWee, of Middletown, Md., a Falun Gong practitioner, said a  
site he maintains to promote the group, www.falunusa.net, has been 
under persistent electronic assault. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, McWee said his Web server was  
undergoing a continuous ``denial-of-service'' attack, a common 
Internet tactic used to overwhelm a computer with repeated 
electronic requests -- like a telephone ringing nonstop to block 
other callers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, someone tried to gain access to the server,  
pretending to be a legitimate webmaster, and in the process left an 
Internet address, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to hack my machine from theirs. And they can't do  
that without revealing their'' Internet address, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The address McWee said was left behind is registered with the  
Asia Pacific Network Information Centre, a public registry service 
for Internet addressees. According to the service, there are two 
phone numbers in Beijing listed with that address. 
</P>
<P>
	When The Associated Press called the numbers, a person who  
answered the phone identified them as belonging to the Public 
Security Ministry. A telephone operator at the ministry said they 
belonged to its Internet Monitoring Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry refused to respond to a written request for comment  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	McWee registered a complaint about the hacking attempt with the  
Maryland state police's computer crimes division. Police spokesman 
Pete Piringer said that because the attack did not succeed in 
getting access to McWee's server, there did not seem to be a crime 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrators of other Web sites devoted to the movement also  
said they had been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Shao, in Nottingham, Britain, said the site he maintains was  
hacked into Monday. What he called Chinese ``government 
propaganda'' was placed on some pages, while others were deleted. 
</P>
<P>
	Jillian Ye, of Toronto, who maintains two sites, said that  
beginning one or two months ago, her server began going down almost 
every day. The problems got progressively worse, until she 
recognized the symptoms of an attack and moved the sites to a more 
secure server. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong, founded by Li Hongzhi, who now lives in the United  
States, draws on martial arts, Buddhism and Taoism. The group says 
its goals are physical and mental fitness and high moral standards, 
and denies that it is either a religion or a political movement.

<TEXT>
<P>
	The texts of four notes found in Mark O. Barton's apartment  
along with the bodies of his wife, son and daughter, as released by 
Henry County, Ga., police. The first note, found in the living 
room, was generated on a computer on Barton's personal stationery. 
The others, found on each of the three bodies, were handwritten. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	July 29, 1999, 6:38 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	To Whom It May Concern:  
</P>
<P>
	Leigh Ann is in the master bedroom closet under a blanket. I  
killed her on Tuesday night. I killed Matthew and Mychelle 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be similarities between these deaths and the death of  
my first wife, Debra Spivey. However, I deny killing her and her 
mother. There's no reason for me to lie now. It just seemed like a 
quiet way to kill and a relatively painless way to die. 
</P>
<P>
	There was little pain. All of them were dead in less than five  
minutes. I hit them with a hammer in their sleep and then put them 
face down in a bathtub to make sure they did not wake up in pain. 
To make sure they were dead. I am so sorry. I wish I didn't. Words 
cannot tell the agony. Why did I? 
</P>
<P>
	I have been dying since October. I wake up at night so afraid,  
so terrified that I couldn't be that afraid while awake. It has 
taken its toll. I have come to hate this life and this system of 
things. I have come to have no hope. 
</P>
<P>
	I killed the children to exchange them for five minutes of pain  
for a lifetime of pain. I forced myself to do it to keep them from 
suffering so much later. No mother, no father, no relatives. The 
fears of the father are transferred to the son. It was from my 
father to me and from me to my son. He already had it and now to be 
left alone. I had to take him with me. 
</P>
<P>
	I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for  
my demise as I planned to kill the others. I really wish I hadn't 
killed her now. She really couldn't help it and I love her so much 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	I know that Jehovah will take care of all of them in the next  
life. I'm sure the details don't matter. There is no excuse, no 
good reason. I am sure no one would understand. If they could, I 
wouldn't want them to. I just write these things to say why. 
</P>
<P>
	Please know that I love Leigh Ann, Matthew and Mychelle with all  
of my heart. If Jehovah is willing, I would like to see all of them 
again in the resurrection, to have a second chance. I don't plan to 
live very much longer, just long enough to kill as many of the 
people that greedily sought my destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	You should kill me if you can.  
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I give you my wife, Leigh Ann Vandiver Barton. My honey, my  
precious love. Please take care of her. I will love her forever. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I give you Matthew David Barton. My son, my buddy, my life.  
Please take care of him. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	I give you Mychelle Elizabeth Barton. My daughter, my  
sweetheart, my life. Please take care of her.

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Barton Vowed To Avoid Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR BLUFF, Ala. (AP) -- Long considered the only suspect in the  
hacking deaths of his wife and mother-in-law in northeast Alabama, 
Mark Barton once made a chilling claim to an investigator in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me that he would never go to jail,'' Danny Smith  
recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton upheld the vow. He committed suicide hours after a  
killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead: nine people in two 
trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Police always believed Barton was to blame for the grisly  
slayings of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise 
Spivey, in 1993. Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 
life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side. 
Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one  
thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the 
camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a 
hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said  
Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's 
office. ``We didn't have any fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading  
offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others. Afterward, his wife and 
two children were found dead in their apartment. They had been 
beaten with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton  
acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the 
Alabama killings. But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for 
me to lie now,'' denied committing the '93 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities  
said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but 
believed they did all they could. Barton was the only suspect ever 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,''  
Smith said. ``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not 
prove it legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women were found dead inside a blood-splattered trailer at a  
campground along Weiss Lake. As many as 600 people were at the 
campground when the women were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found bloody footprints leading out the camper  
door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the 
shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton. Police talked with 
everyone who was at the campground that day, but no one remembered 
seeing Barton. 
</P>
<P>
	Early tests on Barton's company car indicated the possible  
presence of blood around the front seat. But before police could 
analyze the spot again, Barton -- a chemist -- claimed to have 
spilled a soft drink in the vehicle, ruining any potential 
evidence, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another investigator involved in the case, speaking on condition  
of anonymity, said police first became suspicious of Barton after 
he gave ``rehearsed'' answers during an interview. He also refused 
a polygraph test. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only after that, the source said, that officers found out  
about the $600,000 insurance policy on Debra Barton that took 
effect less than a month before she was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe Barton, involved with another woman, came  
to Alabama to ask her for a divorce and she refused, prompting the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the insurance company, Investors Life Insurance of  
Nebraska, offered to pay the full amount of the policy, provided 
all the money went into a trust fund for the couple's two children. 
Barton refused and eventually settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Court records show the insurer paid $450,000 on the policy, with  
$150,000 of that going into trust for Barton's children and the 
remainder going to Barton and his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama authorities said they didn't know whether Barton's  
second wife, Leigh Ann Barton, was the woman he had been dating 
during his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	However, her ex-husband, David Lang, told the New York Daily  
News that she was, and he said he believes she helped Barton cover 
up his involvement in the slayings to collect the insurance policy. 
Lang did not return messages left by The Associated Press on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	After Barton remarried, he would periodically call Smith and ask  
why he was a suspect in the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a game to him. He got mad at me one time because he  
couldn't convince me he didn't do it,'' Smith said.

	GOP Braces for Tax-Cut Battle  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans are moving  
quickly to join forces for the coming battle against the White 
House over the size and scope of the tax cut they hope to give the 
American people in the next decade. The Senate yesterday approved a 
$792 billion tax plan that mirrors an earlier House-passed bill in 
size but differs in the kinds of tax relief included. The vote was 
57-43, mostly along party lines. President Clinton has said 
repeatedly he will veto the GOP plans because they are three times 
what the economy can safely digest.

two today as he visited the Kosovo capital and urged its people to 
live together in peace. It was Blair's first visit to Kosovo since 
NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. He visited British 
troops for several hours last night after attending a summit on

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Lunar Prospector spacecraft was sent to a  
violent collision with the moon today. But powerful telescopes 
watching from the Earth failed to detect a dust cloud, a result 
that some called ``a bit of a disappointment.'' The lack of dust, 
however, does not mean that a search for evidence of water on the 
moon has failed, experts said. Telescopes, using ultraviolet 
filters, will continue to look for clues that water vapor was 
splashed into the lunar sky by the impact.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mark O. Barton, the gunman who killed nine people  
at two brokerage firms Thursday, had lost roughly $105,000 in stock 
trading in less than two months, authorities said yesterday. He 
left a note vowing revenge on those who had ``greedily sought my 
destruction.'' Barton's wife, son and daughter were found 
bludgeoned to death in the family residence. Thirteen also were 
wounded in the office attacks, with five still in critical 
condition last night. Barton killed himself to avoid arrest.

	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- Rescuers have recovered the body  
of one of the last people missing after a river accident this week 
in the Swiss Alps, police said today. The discovery brings to 20 
the number of people confirmed killed in the flash flood. The body 
was found last night in Lake Brienz, about 2 1/2 miles downstream from 
the scene of the accident, at a depth of more than 200 feet, Bern 
state police said. The people were swept away as they bodysurfed 
down the fast-running Saxeten Brook on Tuesday near this central 
Alpine resort.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- United Airlines agreed to extend some  
benefits to domestic partners, just hours after an appeals court 
yesterday refused to grant the company an exemption to a city 
ordinance mandating the benefits. The law, which took effect June 
1, 1997, requires companies doing business with San Francisco to 
offer the same benefits to domestic partners as they do to married 
spouses. United said it will begin offering family benefits to 
non-married families nationwide next May. The company has 20,000 
employees in San Francisco.

league lead with 38 home runs and set a record for most homers in a 
five-year span when he hit one in the sixth inning of St. Louis' 
game against Colorado last night. McGwire hit a 1-0 pitch from 
Pedro Astacio into the right-field bullpen to lead off the sixth 
for his 11th homer in 15 games and cut the Rockies' lead over the 
Cardinals to 3-2. He has 257 homers the last five years, breaking 
the record he shared with Babe Ruth, who hit 256 from 1926-30.

night to lead the New York Yankees to a 13-3 victory over the 
Boston Red Sox. Knoblauch, who missed the previous two games after 
complaining of dizziness, was 5-for-6 with four RBIs. Jorge Posada 
had two doubles and a two-run homer. The back-to-back homers to 
lead off the game were the first for the Yankees since April 27, 
1955, when Hank Bauer and Andy Carey did it against the Chicago 
White Sox.

<HEADLINE>  Cops: Barton Vowed To Avoid Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR BLUFF, Ala. (AP) -- Long considered the only suspect in the  
hacking deaths of his wife and mother-in-law in northeast Alabama, 
Mark Barton once made a chilling claim to an investigator in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me that he would never go to jail,'' Danny Smith  
recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton upheld the vow. He committed suicide hours after a  
killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead: nine people in two 
trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Police always believed Barton was to blame for the grisly  
slayings of his first wife, Debra Barton, and her mother, Eloise 
Spivey, in 1993. Barton had the motive, they believed: a $600,000 
life insurance policy on his wife and a girlfriend on the side. 
Investigators knew he had a temper and an opportunity to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barton denied he did it, and authorities lacked the one  
thing they needed to arrest him: proof he had ever been to the 
camper where the women were found butchered, apparently with a 
hatchet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have any witnesses who could put him there,'' said  
Smith, an investigator with the Cherokee County district attorney's 
office. ``We didn't have any fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton shot and killed nine people in two Atlanta stock-trading  
offices on Thursday, injuring 13 others. Afterward, his wife and 
two children were found dead in their apartment. They had been 
beaten with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter left at his apartment in Henry County, Ga., Barton  
acknowledged that the murders of his family were similar to the 
Alabama killings. But Barton, writing that ``there's no reason for 
me to lie now,'' denied committing the '93 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Georgia rampage, Alabama authorities  
said Friday they were still troubled by the '93 killings but 
believed they did all they could. Barton was the only suspect ever 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of anything we could have done differently,''  
Smith said. ``We knew morally that he had done it, but we could not 
prove it legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women were found dead inside a blood-splattered trailer at a  
campground along Weiss Lake. As many as 600 people were at the 
campground when the women were killed.

door, but the FBI laboratory could not identify the brand of the 
shoe, taking away one possible link to Barton. Police talked with

<HEADLINE> Rockies, Mets Trade Four Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Rockies and Mets swapped center fielders  
and left-handed relievers Saturday night, with Darryl Hamilton and 
Chuck McElroy going to New York and Colorado getting Brian McRae 
and Rigo Beltran. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies also got minor league outfielder Thomas Johnson in  
the deal, announced about 20 minutes before the Rockies played the 
Cardinals and about four hours ahead of the midnight EDT trading 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets made two more deals, acquiring Oakland closer Billy  
Taylor for right-hander Jason Isringhausen and infielder Shawon 
Dunston from St. Louis for minor leaguer Craig Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, fourth in the AL with 26 saves, will likely be a set-up  
man for Armando Benitez in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, once one of the Mets brightest pitching prospects,  
has been hampered by injuries throughout his career and was sent to 
the bullpen earlier this year. He is 1-3 with a 6.41 ERA this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, batting .303 with four homers and 24 RBIs, had been in  
the Rockies lineup and hitting second against the St. Louis 
Cardinals. He and McElroy, 3-1 with a 6.20 ERA, were called off the 
field during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Both planned to join the Mets on Sunday in Chicago and were  
happy about landing with a contending team. Todd Helton was 
inserted in the No. 2 slot and played first base, and hit a two-run 
homer in the third. Jeff Barry played center field and batted 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised, but a little relieved that it's  
over,'' Hamilton said. ``I gained about 25 games in a five-minute 
phone call. That makes it a little more interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy, who has a 3.64 career ERA, also was looking forward to  
a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``The adrenaline is going now,'' McElroy said. ``I didn't have  
the kind of year I wanted to here, so I'm looking forward to having 
some fun over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, 31, has been a disappointment with the Mets, batting .221  
with eight homers and 36 RBIs and stealing only two bases in eight 
attempts. He has been with the Mets about two years after coming 
from the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 8, 1997, in a deal that involved 
Lance Johnson and Mark Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Beltran, 29, was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk July 25.  
</P>
<P>
	The deal apparently was attractive from a financial standpoint  
to the Rockies. Hamilton and McElroy are in the first year of 
three-year contracts, while McRae is in the final year of his 
contract and Beltran is not arbitration-eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets figured Hamilton was a nice upgrade in center field.  
</P>
<P>
	``Darryl's hitting over .300 right now and we think he's going  
to improve us offensively and defensively,'' general manager Steve 
Phillips said. ``Unfortunately, Brian couldn't get anything going 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy waived a no-trade clause to New York.  
</P>
<P>
	``When this time comes and teams need left-handed pitchers, you  
expect something,'' McElroy said. ``I thought it was going to be 
Houston or the Yankees or maybe San Diego.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this season, McRae had questioned manager Bobby  
Valentine's lineups. Shortly thereafter, the Mets put McRae and 
Bobby Bonilla on irrevocable waivers, though no team claimed them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Brian couldn't get anything going this year,''  
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	McRae left Wrigley Field shortly after a 17-10 loss to the Cubs  
and was unavailable for comment. He did not play in the game.

<HEADLINE> Skydiving Plane Crashes, 10 Die </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A plane carrying nine  
members of a skydiving group that was holding its annual campout 
crashed shortly after takeoff Saturday, killing all the passengers 
and the pilot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a twin-engine Beech King Air 200, came down at 8:20  
a.m. in a grassy field near Marine City Airport, about 40 miles 
north of Detroit, said State Police Sgt. Craig Nyeholt. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Silliman, the National Transportation Safety Board  
investigator in charge, said the cause was not yet known but heat 
could have been a factor. High temperatures and humidity make it 
harder for planes to take off, NTSB spokesman George Black said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday was in the 80s and humid.  
</P>
<P>
	All the passengers were members of the Parahawks, a skydiving  
group that apparently had gathered at the airport for its three-day 
annual pig roast and campout. The event reportedly was to end 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at the Parahawks skydiving  
center at the airport refused to discuss the club or the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very extended family,'' said James Relken, the local  
Red Cross chapter director, who was counseling families of the 
victims at the crash site. ``The immediate family may not be here, 
but they're extended family to each other. That's very evident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Sers, who said he was the brother of one of the victims,  
said the Parahawks jumped weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where my brother loved to be. This is his passion.  
That's what he loved to do,'' said Sers, who declined to give his 
brother's name. ``If you've got to die doing something, it ought to 
be something you have a passion for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Wilson said his 22-year-old nephew Roger Engle III had  
made more than 100 jumps and was also an expert at 
parachute-packing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was out here all the time. He jumped a whole lot. We were  
hoping that he wasn't (on the plane), but his grandpa knew he 
was,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the skydivers had made at least 200 jumps and each had a  
D license, the highest level of certification one could receive 
from the association, said Gary Cooper, regional director of the 
U.S. Parachuting Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Some made as many as 5,000 jumps, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lorraine and Richard Cassis flew in from Chicago with their  
6-week-old son, Makoul, after receiving word that her brother, 
24-year-old Matt Myers, had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all worried,'' when Myers, an auto mechanic, took up  
skydiving about two years ago, Ms. Cassis said. ``He was very 
independent, a free spirit of a guy. He loved what he was doing. 
That was his favorite thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot, Paul Myks, was a Spirit Airlines pilot who flew  
DC-9's for the airline, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macomb County Medical Examiner Werner Spitz said the plane,  
which crashed shortly after takeoff, broke into three parts and the 
victim's bodies were strewn across a 50-yard area of wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitz said one body found in the cockpit was not wearing a  
parachute and is believed to be that of the pilot. The other nine 
victims were wearing parachutes, but they never had an opportunity 
to jump, Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Franz, who lives near the airport, said he heard the  
plane taking off -- then the engine went dead. A second or two 
later, he said, there was a loud crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Miller, 45, and his son Dustin were sitting in their living  
room when they saw the plane coming toward the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Planes come in and out all the time. But this one was a sharp  
bank that was more than usual. We could see the bottom of the 
plane,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Dustin: ``It was coming in awfully fast. I heard a  
crunching sound like a can being crunched. Then the ground shook a 
little and we saw the black smoke and called 911.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There have been at least two fatal accidents involving  
skydivers' planes in the last several months, 
</P>
<P>
	In May, five skydivers and the pilot of their plane died when  
the aircraft crashed into a field in Celina, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, a plane carrying members of a skydiving club  
crashed in Grain Valley, Mo., after reporting an electrical 
emergency shortly after takeoff. All six people on board the Cessna 
206 were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Truffer, publisher of Skydiving magazine, acknowledged the  
potential hazards of parachuting, saying ``jumpers are engaged in 
the risky sport by choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in Saturday's accident, he noted, the victims died simply as  
air travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	``For much of the ride to altitude, they (parachutists) are just  
passengers,'' he said by telephone from the magazine's Deland, 
Fla., headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame's Davie Gets Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame and football coach Bob Davie  
have reached agreement on a contract extension that will keep him 
at the helm of the Irish program through the 2003 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The South Bend Tribune reported Saturday that executive vice  
president E. William Beauchamp and athletic director Mike Wadsworth 
worked out the agreement with Davie, whose contract was to expire 
after the 2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal begins this season. Davie signed the original deal  
when he took over for Lou Holtz before the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	No terms of the contract were discussed by Notre Dame officials,  
and Davie wasn't available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	But he had said in January that he was comfortable with the base  
salary he was paid. ``To automatically presume I am underpaid may 
be inaccurate,'' he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Such extensions are becoming more common in college football,  
including recent five-year extensions granted to Purdue coach Joe 
Tiller and Alabama's Mike DuBose. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big part of this has to do with recruiting,'' Wadsworth  
said. ``Coaches are sometimes at a disadvantage in recruiting an 
athlete when he's not able to quell rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It works both ways. If a program is struggling, speculation is  
raised. If a program is having success, there are also rumors. We 
had to face reality that these rumors are used against us in 
recruiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davie's newfound job security comes after two tumultuous  
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	On the field, his teams have gone 7-5 and 9-3 and earned berths  
in the Independence and Gator bowls. Off the field, Davie endured a 
courtroom loss in the Joe Moore age-discrimination trial. And he 
recently represented his program before an NCAA Infraction 
Committee hearing on whether a former Notre Dame booster gave 
illegal financial help to as many as a dozen football players. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the turmoil he inherited, Bob came through it with a  
lot of maturity,'' Wadsworth said. ``He has been able to focus on 
the job at hand and still have success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wadsworth said the university is judging the progress of the  
football program on more than wins and losses, also looking at 
whether the program, its recruiting and long-range planning are 
improving under Davie. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer to all of those questions is yes, he said.  
</P>

	``There were other factors at play,'' Wadsworth said. ``This was  
a clear statement of where the university stands. Any confusion can 
be eradicated. This will distance him from situations not of his 
making.''

<HEADLINE> Gerber Axes Bioengineered Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUMMIT, N.J. (AP) -- The nation's largest maker of baby food says  
it will stop using genetically engineered corn and soybean 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis AG of Switzerland, the parent company of Gerber, said  
it was considering the move even before the environmental group 
Greenpeace asked for information about the company's use of 
bioengineered products. Other baby-food makers have made similar 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a mother to buy our product and have no concerns,''  
said Al Piergallini, president and CEO of Novartis' North American 
consumer health division, based in Summit. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis expects that by the end of September it will no longer  
be using corn and soybeans that have been genetically altered to be 
resistant to pests and weedkilling chemicals. Such ingredients 
account for about half of 1 percent of Gerber's ingredients, and 
are used mainly in dry cereal, spokeswoman Katherine King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace makes no particular claims that genetically modified  
foods are dangerous to humans or the environment, arguing only that 
the health risks are unknown. Novartis officials said they still 
believe their existing Gerber products are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has found no  
particular health problems with genetically modified agricultural 
products, concluding that they ``are as safe as other foods in the 
grocery store.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some countries refuse to allow the sale of genetically  
altered corn and soybeans grown in America.

	WESTMINSTER, Md. (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens were the ones  
seeking autographs after their latest training session. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Hackman showed up Friday to do some research for his  
upcoming role as a pro football coach. Hackman is to play a

<HEADLINE> Bipartisan Tax-Cut Effort Fizzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to craft a $500 billion bipartisan tax  
cut fizzled unceremoniously in the Senate on Thursday as political 
lines hardened and President Clinton reinforced his threat to veto 
a larger Republican tax relief package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe America wants to be governed from the center, and  
America needs to be governed from the center,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, 
R-Pa., said of the bipartisan proposal, which roughly split the 
difference between the GOP's $792 billion tax cut and a smaller 
$290 billion version advanced by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a leading architect of the  
proposal, conceded, ``Neither party at this time is supportive.'' 
After more than an hour of debate, Breaux withdrew the measure 
without so much as a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the Senate marched methodically toward  
approval of the GOP-crafted bill, with tax breaks for individuals, 
families, education, retirement accounts and numerous other 
provisions. A final vote was set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate talks are expected to begin this weekend, and GOP  
leaders harbor hopes of passing the resulting compromise through 
both houses next week. That would enable Republicans to spend 
Congress' August break touting the virtue of their measure, and set 
the stage for a fall confrontation with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Before boarding Air Force One for a flight to Europe, Clinton  
renewed his threat to veto the bill, saying it was too large and 
``risky'' for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with the American people sharing the surplus?  
After all, it belongs to them,'' rebutted Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
R-Alaska. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who shepherded a 
companion bill to passage last week, added, ``I don't think it's 
risky to have faith in the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's threatened veto, coupled with the Senate's arcane  
rules, turned the lengthy debate on the Senate floor into political 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, maneuvering for advantage, called for reducing the  
GOP tax measure to provide room for a new prescription drug benefit 
for Medicare recipients. But the vote came on a parliamentary 
motion rather than on any specific proposal to provide prescription 
drug benefits to the nation's elderly. And it gained the support of 
only 45 senators -- all but one of them Democrats -- far below the 60 
votes it needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This debate is about priorities. New tax breaks are a priority  
for the Republicans,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
``Prescription drugs for senior citizens are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., countered that as chairman of the  
committee with jurisdiction over Medicare, the Senate Finance 
Committee, he intended to address ``this most important concern'' 
as soon as lawmakers return to Washington from their scheduled 
August break. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., sharply rebutted Democratic claims  
that the GOP tax bill wouldn't leave room for a new Medicare 
benefit. Instead, he sought to turn the political tables. 
</P>
<P>
	A veto by Clinton, he said, would wipe out provisions to make  
education more affordable and child care more accessible. ``Where 
does he get off running around the land saying he's for education 
and we're not?'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and other Republicans  
sought to substitute an across-the-board tax cut similar to the 
House measure for a portion of the bill pending in the Senate. That 
proposal, too, was rejected on a parliamentary motion after 
politically tinged debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued the change would make the measure more  
favorable to the wealthy at the expense of lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gramm said 50 percent of Americans pay only 4.3 percent of  
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get a tax cut because they don't pay income  
taxes,'' he said. ``Tax cuts are for taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each side also labored to show its backing for popular programs  
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pushed a ``lockbox'' amendment that they said would  
set aside surpluses generated by payroll tax revenue for Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a similar proposal that would have  
offered protection to Medicare, as well as Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Both approaches were rejected.  
</P>
<P>
	As written, the GOP proposal called for reducing the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is now taxed at 28 percent. Together, those provisions account for 
nearly $300 billion of the $792 billion measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also includes relief from the so-called marriage  
penalty that forces some couples to pay more in taxes than they 
would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains several provisions to assist taxpayers  
with retirement accounts, to provide tax breaks for education and 
long-term health care, and to reduce estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the doomed bipartisan proposal would have increased  
the standard deduction by $4,300 for joint tax filers, $2,150 for 
heads of households and $1,300 for single filers. Supporters said 
that change would have eliminated the marriage penalty for many 
taxpayers and simplified tax filing for millions of Americans.

<HEADLINE> Johnny Mitchell Quits Jets Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Johnny Mitchell's comeback with the New  
York Jets lasted one day. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's first-round draft pick in 1992, who was out of  
football for the last two seasons, turned in his equipment shortly 
before Saturday morning's training camp session and left without 
speaking to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, 28, was signed by the Jets in February after asking  
coach Bill Parcells for a chance to make the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets planned to terminate the tight end's contract, believed  
to be a two-year, $1.2 million deal, later Saturday. Mitchell was 
not given a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't take long, did it?'' Parcells said. ``It's sad. One  
day -- you'd think you'd give it more than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After signing with Miami as a free agent in 1996, Mitchell  
lasted 12 days with the Dolphins before walking out of camp. He 
spent five weeks on the Dallas Cowboys' roster later that season 
before dropping out of football for two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the rest of the team, 'Any more of you that are going  
to quit, do it now,' '' Parcells said of announcing Mitchell's 
departure to the team. ``I told them, 'Don't waste my time.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, another player apparently took Parcells' words  
to heart. Veteran offensive lineman Erik Norgard, expected to back 
up Kevin Mawae at center, also left camp for undisclosed reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets said they would take no immediate action on Norgard,  
who signed a three-year, $2.4 million contract with the Jets last 
spring after playing his first nine seasons with the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said that Norgard, 33, told Parcells that he no longer  
wished to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mitchell nor Norgard was available for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3, 248-pound Mitchell, who emerged from the club's  
offseason workout program in terrific shape, apparently had grown 
upset over his struggles with the playbook. Teammates who played 
with the former Nebraska standout during his initial tour with the 
club from 1992-95 said Mitchell had grown reserved in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more quiet than usual,'' safety Victor Green said. ``He  
came out (Thursday) and I didn't hear him say anything. He didn't 
even talk. I guess he couldn't deal with it. I heard someone say 
that he said it was too much mentally. He was making too many 
mental errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets had hoped that Mitchell would earn a spot as one of the  
team's F-backs, a hybrid fullback-tight end position that Parcells 
and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis are considering for this 
season. With Mitchell gone, second-year tight end Blake Spence, 
along with fullbacks Jerald Sowell and Richie Anderson, are 
considered the front-runners for the role. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also speculation that the Jets will re-sign running  
back Keith Byars, a leader in the team's march to the AFC title 
game last season.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Tripp-Lewinsky Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from more than 20 hours of tape recordings that Linda  
Tripp made of conversations with Monica Lewinsky, released Oct. 2 
as part of evidence referred to the House Judiciary Committee by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The tapes were made between Oct. 
3 and Dec. 22, 1997; the date of each conversation was not apparent 
in the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: I mean, I believe things happen for a reason, although I  
have yet to figure out why this happened. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I can't figure it out. Nothing really good has come of  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Maybe it's so that you can tell your grandchildren you  
had an affair with the you-know-what of the you-know-what. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I don't think so. ... What if your grandma right now  
told you she had an affair with the president? How vastly would 
that change your grandma's life? ... 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: You know what's sad? Is it's just I'm leaving, and  
there is nothing I gained from this experience. He -- his behavior 
in the past few months has really -- really just eroded any -- any 
notion I ever had of -- like a pleasant memory, you know. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Well, time has a real strange way of coloring things  
different ways, so maybe in a -- in a few years, you'll see this 
differently. And it also depends on whether you continue to have 
any kind of relationship with him down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Which I doubt.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You know. A friendship, a romantic -- who knows? I mean,  
all of that will play into how your memory serves you. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I just wish I could do something-- I wish I could just  
do something that would make him go, 'Gee, I was stupid,' you know? 
Like, 'Boy, it was really dumb to let her go' -- or something. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: This navy blue dress. Now all I would say to you is: I  
know how you feel today ... but you have a very long life ahead of 
you. ... I would rather you had that in your possession if you need 
it years from now. ... 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Well, I'll think about it. ...  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: ... It could be your only insurance policy down the road.  
Or it could never be needed and you can throw it away. ... Maybe 
I'm being paranoid. ... 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: You are being paranoid. Because I'm never going to  
come forward with this. So as far as I know -- 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: I know that. ... I'm not saying you would ever come  
forward with this. I'm just saying -- 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: And if someone else did, I would deny, deny, deny.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I got ... the creep a tie.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Oh, please.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I know. It was 20 bucks at Marshalls.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Oh, good. Who makes it?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Calvin Klein. ... Yeah. It's gorgeous.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Yeah, Marshalls generally -- every now and then you can  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I know. It's really nice. ... So I put a really funny  
note with it. I'm going to send it with the book. ... But with the 
tie I wrote such a funny card, Linda. ... and I'm like, 'And just 
think now you can pay homage to me if you want by having a work 
week in which you wear one of my ties every day.' (laughter) 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: (laughter) 'Cause this will be the fifth one, right?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: (laughter) Now there are five. It's the fifth one. ...  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Linda, I can't take it anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: I know. I know.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: (crying) It's just too -- it's too much for one person.  
(crying) 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Oh, it is too much for one person. ...  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I go to work every day (crying) and I just (crying),  
I'm trying to keep it together and I just can't. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You've been a trouper through this, Monica. ...  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I miss him. You'll get mad at me. You know what I said  
at the end? 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: What?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: The worst I could say.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: 'Do you love me?'  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: No.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: 'I love you.'  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yep.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I did. We're getting off, and I'm like, all right, 'I  
love you, butthead.' I called him butthead. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: And what'd he say?  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Doctors Puzzled by Drug's Underuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	So maybe they really should put statin drugs in the water supply  
as some heart doctors only half-jokingly suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	The put-it-in-the-water quip inevitably surfaces, it seems,  
whenever heart specialists gather to talk pills. It echoes both 
their confidence in statins' power to lower cholesterol and their 
frustration that millions miss out. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is it, they wonder, that despite nonstop haranguing by the  
country's top heart gurus and saturation advertising by drug 
makers, these safe, lifesaving medicines are so underused? 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly everyone who studies cholesterol for a living seems to  
agree that statin drugs should be taken by many more people. 
Statins are one of the true medical breakthroughs of recent times. 
They spectacularly reduce cholesterol, and they do it far better 
than even the most draconian diet and exercise programs. A 60-point 
drop in cholesterol is nothing special on statins. 
</P>
<P>
	Their effects on health are equally impressive. Statins keep  
arteries from clogging up and may even reverse the process. People 
on statins lower their risk of heart attacks by about one-third. 
They need fewer angioplasty and bypass operations. And they live 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the drugs are easy to take, and side effects are  
rare. Clearly, this is medicine that works. Yet statins are not 
being pumped into the water supply, not even close. 
</P>
<P>
	About 8 million Americans now take them. But in the opinion of  
many of the country's heart disease elite, perhaps 20 million, even 
30 million, should be on statins. As a result, heart disease, the 
country's No. 1 killer, will take many more than it should. 
</P>
<P>
	Statin drugs ``have had the greatest impact of anything I've  
seen over the past three decades,'' says Dr. Antonio Gotto, a 
cardiologist and dean of the Cornell University medical school. 
``With wider application, they have the potential of making a 
tremendous dent in death and disability from coronary disease. 
We've only started to scratch the surface of that potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why is that? Many say it boils down to the simplest of  
shortcomings: Doctors fail to offer statins to people who need 
them; people who need them fail to take them. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the obvious is a complex web of problems and  
uncertainties, and experts say no single thread tells the whole 
story. For instance, at $100 a month, price alone keeps many off 
the drug, and that's just the start. Some doctors are too out of 
touch or overworked to write the prescriptions. Some patients are 
too pill-phobic to take them. And then there's the fact that the 
medical system often emphasizes treating disease rather than 
preventing it. 
</P>
<P>
	Five brands are available: Lipitor, Zocor, Pravachol, Lescol,  
Mevacor and Baycol. They are called statins because their generic 
names, such as lovastatin and atorvastatin, all end the same way. 
The first of these drugs came on the market a decade ago, but the 
evidence of their worth amassed slowly, much of it over the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs differ in potency but basically work the same way. All  
inhibit a protein called 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A 
reductase, which is necessary for the liver to make cholesterol. 
When statins first came into use, many doctors were leery they 
might cause liver damage. But over time this has proven to be 
highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 1 percent of statins users have possible liver  
abnormalities, as measured by a blood enzyme test given a few weeks 
after treatment starts. The problem is reversible if they quit the 
medicine or possibly switch brands. In one big study, abnormal 
liver enzymes turned out to be just as common among people on dummy 
pills as those taking statins. Whatever the connection, serious 
liver damage from statins has proven to be exceedingly rare. 
</P>
<P>
	As prescription drugs go, statins are unusually free of risks.  
``Ten milligrams of statins is probably as safe as two aspirins,'' 
says Dr. Richard Pasternak of Massachusetts General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors also were dubious at first because they had no proof  
that lowering cholesterol with statins actually saves lives. But 
this, too, has changed with a series of landmark mega-studies. 
</P>
<P>
	The first was the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, which  
tested Zocor on people with both obvious heart disease and high 
cholesterol. Their risk of dying during five years on the medicine 
was about 30 percent lower than expected. Since cardiovascular 
disease kills nearly 1 million Americans annually, the implications 
-- both for preventing deaths and selling drugs -- were obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	To see who else might benefit, four other big studies have since  
looked at statins' effects on folks with healthier hearts and less 
ominous cholesterol levels. The results are remarkably consistent. 
On statins, the risk of dying, of having a heart attack or of 
needing a bypass or angioplasty are between 25 percent and 33 
percent lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Committees of medical experts sometimes meet to help front-line  
doctors make sense of new medical evidence like this. The last time 
this happened for statin drugs was in 1993, when the federal 
government's National Cholesterol Education Program drew up 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before the big studies came out, but even then the  
committee felt the evidence was clear that people with heart 
disease should get statins -- along with sensible diets -- if their 
cholesterol levels are modestly elevated. It set the cutoff for 
cholesterol levels higher for those with no signs of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, the committee will meet again to update these  
recommendations, and it almost certainly will lower the threshold 
for statin use. Still, Dr. James Cleeman, the education program's 
head, estimates that under the 1993 standards, about 12 million or 
13 million Americans should be taking statins -- or 50 percent more 
than are now. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts believe statins should be offered to at least twice  
as many people as the 1993 government standards suggest. At some 
elite medical centers, doctors ignore the guidelines and put 
virtually all heart attack victims on statins, no matter what their 
cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're adopting the philosophy that your cholesterol is too  
high for you if you've had a cardiac event,'' says Dr. Shelley 
Shapiro of the University of Southern California. ``We're starting 
it right in the ICU. They go home with statins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is little question among the experts that statins should  
be front-line therapy for what they call secondary prevention -- 
keeping victims of heart attacks and angina pain from getting 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data in secondary prevention are overwhelming,'' says Dr.  
John A. Ambrose of Saint Vincents Hospital in New York City. ``You 
can't even get people to argue about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet doctors estimate that the drugs are prescribed by only 20  
percent of those diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some disagreement about what doctors call primary  
prevention -- giving statins to those who have no outward signs of 
heart trouble. But even here, evidence is building that outwardly 
healthy people with only mildly elevated cholesterol will live 
longer and better if they take statins. 
</P>
<P>
	The most persuasive evidence comes from Gotto's study of about  
6,000 middle-aged men and women. Their total cholesterol readings 
averaged around 220, somewhat higher than ideal but typical for 
American adults, while their HDL, the variety of cholesterol that 
protects against heart attacks, was considered to be a bit low. On 
statins, their risk of first-time heart attacks and serious chest 
pain fell by about one-third. 
</P>
<P>
	To some, these results mean that many more healthy Americans  
should be on statins, even if their cholesterol levels seem normal. 
Indeed, only 17 percent of the people in Gotto's study would be 
considered candidates for taking statins under the 1993 guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules discourage statins for healthy people unless their  
levels of artery-clogging LDL cholesterol are at least 160. The 
biggest controversy among statins advocates is how low this number 
should fall. Some say 100 is a reasonable cutoff. Others push for 
even more aggressive cholesterol lowering. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at more primitive societies, it's not uncommon to  
see adult males with LDLs less than 80,'' says Dr. Steven Nissen of 
the Cleveland Clinic, a member of the lower-is-better camp. ``We 
have simply set the standard too high. We've got to get LDL down to 
60 to 80 and total cholesterol under 150. I think we'll find if we 
do that, we will literally stop this disease in its tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Statins studies are underway to see if Nissen is right. No  
matter what the results, however, some doctors are likely to balk 
at putting perfectly healthy people on cholesterol drugs for life. 
This is because most won't benefit in the short run. In Gotto's 
study, 55 people had to take statins for five years to prevent one 
heart attack or angina onset. 
</P>
<P>
	However, doctors have many less-thought-out reasons, too, for  
ignoring statins. One is that many primary care doctors simply do 
not know much about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if statins have been out there for 10 years. Lots  
of specialties are not good at incorporating new ideas into 
practice, and generalists tend to be slower,'' says Dr. Theodore 
Ganiats of the University of California-San Diego, who represents 
primary care doctors on the National Cholesterol Education Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other reasons:  
</P>
<P>
	--Many doctors feel that in a 10-minute office visit, they can  
convince patients to make only one or two changes. If a potbellied 
50-year-old smoker has high blood pressure and borderline diabetes, 
cholesterol may not seem like the most important thing to talk 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some doctors may not want the extra work involved in persuading  
patients to take statins, making sure they have follow-up liver 
tests, checking their cholesterol counts, scaling up the doses as 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Physicians tend to be a real show-me group that changes  
slowly and gets on the bandwagon slowly,'' says Dr. Calvin 
Weisberger, a Kaiser Permanente cardiologist in Los Angeles. Many 
probably remain skeptical of the benefits of statins, no matter 
what they've heard. 
</P>
<P>
	--Statins typically cost between $70 and $100 a month. This is  
likely to seem especially steep, considering that the drugs 
typically don't make people feel better. But prices are likely to 
fall in the next two to three years as the drugs lose patent 
protection and cheaper generics appear. Drug companies might even 
ask approval to sell them without prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some people shun statins because they ``overestimate how much  
personal control they have over their cholesterol,'' says Dr. Margo 
Denke of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Most 
cannot bring seriously high cholesterol down enough with diet 
alone. That approach typically can lower cholesterol by only about 
5 percent to 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some patients are not told, or don't understand, that they have  
to use statins for the rest of their lives, not just until their 
cholesterol falls. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical shortcomings have a way of healing themselves over time,  
and underuse of statins is likely to do the same. Experts estimate 
that statin prescriptions rose by almost one-third last year. And 
some doctors say the aversion to prescribing statins and taking 
them appears to be easing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Andrew Hauser of William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak,  
Mich. has little doubt what this will mean. ``The statins, more 
than any other drug in the last decade, offer the promise for 
patients at risk of coronary artery disease to live a full life 
free of angina, heart attacks and premature death,'' he says. ``I 
have no idea what the reluctance is, personally. The evidence is so 
overwhelming.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Homers in First Two at-Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Barry Bonds homered in his first two at-bats  
for the second straight game Saturday night, giving the San 
Francisco Giants a 5-0 lead over the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, limited this season by an injured elbow and groin, hit  
solo homers in his first two at-bats off Denny Neagle as the Giants 
lost to the Reds 7-4 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he hit a three-run homer in the first inning off  
Ron Villone and added a two-run shot in the third, giving him four 
homers in his last six at-bats -- all off left-handers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Bonds' 38th multihomer game, moving him ahead of Stan  
Musial, Ted Williams and Juan Gonzalez into 20th place on the 
career list. Bonds has three multihomer games this season and 16 
homers overall. 
</P>
<P>
	With his four homers in the series, Bonds raised his career  
total in Cincinnati to 28. Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt hit 29 in 
Cincinnati, the most by a visiting player. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' second homer Saturday was the 427th of his career, moving  
him one ahead of Billy Williams into 25th place on the career list. 
Willie Mays (646), Mel Ott (511) and Willie McCovey (469) are the 
only Giants with more.

<HEADLINE> GOP Braces for Battle on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans are moving  
quickly to join forces for the coming battle against the White 
House over the size and scope of the tax cut they hope to present 
to the American people in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Friday approved a $792 billion tax plan that  
mirrors an earlier House-passed bill in size but differs in the 
kinds of tax relief included. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43, mostly along party lines.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said repeatedly he would veto the GOP  
plans because they are three times what he thinks the economy can 
safely digest amid efforts to ensure the solvency of Social 
Security and Medicare and pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate made the wrong choice for America's future,''  
Clinton said in a statement Friday. ``By pushing through a tax plan 
that is too big and too bloated, the majority party has pushed 
aside our vital national priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said congressional  
tax specialists would begin talks as early as today, and that a 
House-Senate conference could be held early next week to pave the 
way for final passage of a compromise plan at week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some urgency because Congress recesses at the end of  
the week for its month-long summer vacation. But Lott indicated the 
final bill would not be sent to the president until Congress 
returns in September, avoiding a veto while lawmakers are away from 
Washington and giving them a chance to make their case to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the American people understand what we  
have done,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M. ``We'd like to get our message across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott began that message campaign today in the weekly Republican  
radio address. With the federal budget projected to show a $3.4 
trillion surplus in the next decade, he asked, ``shouldn't you be 
able to keep more of what you earn, for your household needs, or to 
save for your family's future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't selfish to want lower taxes. You know your family  
pays too much for government. I know it. And so does the president. 
But he wants that cash for spending here in Washington,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and most Democrats say that if Social Security  
revenues are put aside, the surplus amounts to about $1 trillion, 
and the GOP plans would put nearly all of that into tax cuts -- 
ignoring education, defense and other programs and doing little to 
fix Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP course ``can best be characterized as one of both  
wishful thinking and fiscal disaster,'' said Senate Democratic 
leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The main elements of the Senate plan include a reduction in the  
bottom 15 percent income tax bracket to 14 percent and expansion of 
the number of taxpayers eligible for that bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase the standard deduction for married couples in  
2001 and allow those couples to file returns as singles in a 
combined form starting in 2005. That would help to eliminate 
situations in which married people pay more than singles because 
their combined incomes forces them into a higher bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would raise the exemption for estate taxes from  
$1 million to $1.5 million in 2007 and raise annual contribution 
limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference in the House bill is that it provides for an  
across-the-board 10 percent cut in tax rates. It also cuts the top 
capital gains tax rate for most investments held at least a year 
from 20 percent to 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who backed a failed attempt to include an across-the-board  
cut in the Senate bill, said he wasn't sure the House-Senate 
conference would move in that direction, but ``if it were that or 
anything else in this bill I'd take that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Democrats -- Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Mary Landrieu  
and John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- voted for 
the GOP plan, while Republicans Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and 
George Voinovich of Ohio opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, who earlier backed an unsuccessful attempt by  
Democratic and Republican moderates to push a $500 billion tax cut, 
said he thought that approach would eventually prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the political script gets played out, the bipartisan  
plan will serve as a blueprint for an October solution that bridges 
the divergent positions on tax cuts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Rise to 18-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Americans are paying more for gasoline thanks  
to improving economies in Asia and OPEC's apparent determination to 
stick to its plan to cut crude oil production. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorists in California and other West Coast states have been  
hardest hit because of refinery explosions that have also cut into 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the average price of gasoline at the pump has risen  
more than 5 cents to $1.267 cents a gallon since early July, 
according to the California-based Lundberg Survey. In February, the 
average price dipped below $1. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices could continue upward during August as more Americans  
take to the road for vacations and weekend outings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're right in the middle of the driving season and the  
economy is strong. People are driving around, taking vacations. 
There is more upward pressure,'' said Alvin Silber, an analyst with 
Herzog Heine Geduld. 
</P>
<P>
	Production cuts were announced by the Organization of the  
Petroleum Exporting Countries and other big oil producers in 
February. To the surprise of many analysts, OPEC countries have 
stuck to their quotas and a worldwide glut of crude oil that pushed 
prices down to historic lows during 1998 and early 1999 is 
disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, demand for both crude oil and refined gasoline  
is increasing, especially in Asia where countries are emerging from 
the economic crisis that began two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the price of key grades of crude oil worldwide has  
nearly doubled since the OPEC cuts went into effect, said Fadel 
Gheit, an analyst with Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC's death has been greatly exaggerated in the last three or  
four years,'' Gheit said. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, an explosion forced Mobil Corp. to cut production  
at its Torrance refinery Wednesday. The company's Richmond plant 
was damaged in a July 10 blast and has not resumed full production. 
</P>
<P>
	Production is lagging at an Exxon refinery in Benicia and a  
Tosco plant in Avon has been shut down since March because of 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	Even at today's prices, gas remains a bargain, Gheit said. When  
adjusted for inflation, prices are at their lowest level since 
World War II.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Tripp-Lewinsky Tapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from more than 20 hours of tape recordings that Linda  
Tripp made of conversations with Monica Lewinsky, released Oct. 2 
as part of evidence referred to the House Judiciary Committee by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The tapes were made between Oct. 
3 and Dec. 22, 1997; the date of each conversation was not apparent 
in the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: I mean, I believe things happen for a reason, although I  
have yet to figure out why this happened. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I can't figure it out. Nothing really good has come of  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Maybe it's so that you can tell your grandchildren you  
had an affair with the you-know-what of the you-know-what. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I don't think so. ... What if your grandma right now  
told you she had an affair with the president? How vastly would 
that change your grandma's life? ... 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: You know what's sad? Is it's just I'm leaving, and  
there is nothing I gained from this experience. He -- his behavior 
in the past few months has really -- really just eroded any -- any 
notion I ever had of -- like a pleasant memory, you know. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Well, time has a real strange way of coloring things  
different ways, so maybe in a -- in a few years, you'll see this 
differently. And it also depends on whether you continue to have 
any kind of relationship with him down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Which I doubt.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You know. A friendship, a romantic -- who knows? I mean,  
all of that will play into how your memory serves you. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I just wish I could do something-- I wish I could just  
do something that would make him go, 'Gee, I was stupid,' you know? 
Like, 'Boy, it was really dumb to let her go' -- or something. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: This navy blue dress. Now all I would say to you is: I  
know how you feel today ... but you have a very long life ahead of 
you. ... I would rather you had that in your possession if you need 
it years from now. ... 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Well, I'll think about it. ...  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: ... It could be your only insurance policy down the road.  
Or it could never be needed and you can throw it away. ... Maybe 
I'm being paranoid. ... 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: You are being paranoid. Because I'm never going to  
come forward with this. So as far as I know -- 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: I know that. ... I'm not saying you would ever come  
forward with this. I'm just saying -- 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: And if someone else did, I would deny, deny, deny.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I got ... the creep a tie.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Oh, please.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I know. It was 20 bucks at Marshalls.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Oh, good. Who makes it?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Calvin Klein. ... Yeah. It's gorgeous.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Yeah, Marshalls generally -- every now and then you can  
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I know. It's really nice. ... So I put a really funny  
note with it. I'm going to send it with the book. ... But with the 
tie I wrote such a funny card, Linda. ... and I'm like, 'And just 
think now you can pay homage to me if you want by having a work 
week in which you wear one of my ties every day.' (laughter) 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: (laughter) 'Cause this will be the fifth one, right?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: (laughter) Now there are five. It's the fifth one. ...  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Linda, I can't take it anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: I know. I know.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: (crying) It's just too -- it's too much for one person.  
(crying) 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: Oh, it is too much for one person. ...  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I go to work every day (crying) and I just (crying),  
I'm trying to keep it together and I just can't. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You've been a trouper through this, Monica. ...  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I miss him. You'll get mad at me. You know what I said  
at the end? 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: What?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: The worst I could say.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: 'Do you love me?'  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: No.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: 'I love you.'  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Yep.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I did. We're getting off, and I'm like, all right, 'I  
love you, butthead.' I called him butthead. 
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: You didn't.  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: I did.  
</P>
<P>
	TRIPP: And what'd he say?  
</P>
<P>
	LEWINSKY: Just nothing. He just kind of hung up. Or I hung up. I  
was like, oh, my God, what the hell just came out of my mouth?

ethnic Albanians who gave him flowers and kisses to live in peace 
with rival Serbs. It is Blair's first trip to Kosovo since the end 
of NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia and the return of 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees driven off by 
Serb forces. Blair told several hundred people gathered in the city 
center that NATO fought the war to bring justice to Kosovo, not to 
allow the minority Serbs in the province to be oppressed.

	GOP Braces for Tax-Cut Battle

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are laboring under a tight  
self-imposed deadline to sculpt a $792 billion tax cut compromise 
that can clear the House and Senate by week's end and set the stage 
for a fall veto showdown with the White House. House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., 
have given fellow Republicans until only Tuesday to resolve 
differences between bills passed by the House and Senate. The 
Senate yesterday approved a $792 billion tax plan 57-43, mostly 
along party lines.

	Clinton Pushes for Patients' Rights  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Congress today to  
pass certain guaranteed rights for managed-care patients' before 
lawmakers break for summer vacation next weekend. Some Republicans, 
led by physicians serving in Congress, are joining Democrats in 
support of the ``patients' bill of rights'' concept and Clinton 
predicts a strong bill would pass if GOP leaders allow a vote. 
``Protecting patients' rights shouldn't be a political issue,'' 
Clinton said in his weekly radio address. ``This isn't a partisan 
issue anywhere else in America. It shouldn't be in Washington, 
D.C.'' Most Republicans say the sweeping Democratic plans are too 
expensive.

shadow of a tree. When the patch recedes at noon, he follows it. An 
hour later, he relies on another temporary spot of cool by the 
guard house on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
	By 3 p.m. there's no place left to hide, and the black pavement  
feels like it's burning through his sandals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start to get really dizzy,'' Soto said Thursday as the  
temperatures crept toward 90 degrees. ``You just try to sit still 
in the coolest place you can find and drink a lot of water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This summer's unrelenting heat has been sapping energy from  
outdoor workers, drying up crops and turning forests into kindling 
across Connecticut and elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 86 deaths in 15 states have been blamed on the heat  
wave that has gripped much of country since July 19, as 
temperatures linger in the 90s and 100s. Missouri has the highest 
death toll at 29. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was expected to last at least until today before a  
change in the jet stream brings cooler air from Canada to northern 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures reached the 90s from the Plains to the East Coast  
on Thursday, with the heat index -- a measure of temperature and 
humidity -- breaking 100 in many places. 
</P>
<P>
	To the north, the weather was even worse. It was 111 in Pierre,  
S.D., topping the record of 109 set in 1933. The temperature was a 
record-tying 104 in Bismarck, N.D., and an all-time high of 103 in 
Dickinson, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, a 6-year-old girl appeared to be one of the latest  
victims. Her body was found Thursday afternoon in her bedroom in 
the family's mobile home in Grove. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no air conditioning or fans, and the windows of the  
trailer were closed,'' said Dr. Robert Hopper, the acting medical 
examiner. ``It was hard to breathe just walking in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air conditioning has become a necessity for many trying to beat  
the heat. But for people whose jobs force them to stay outside, 
getting a steady stream of cool air is a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last summer you could work 10 hours a day with no problem,''  
said Angel Santos, a Hartford, Conn. landscaper. ``This year you 
can't even stay out for seven hours. My reward is going home, 
putting on the air conditioner and chilling the house to 65 
degrees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenfield, Wis., Scott Lewitzke, the landscape manager for  
Bluemel's Garden Center and Greenhouse, said the heat means less 
productivity for his workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys just work at a much slower pace,'' Lewitzke said. ``If  
you get 50 percent productivity, you're lucky. And you can't expect 
much more in the heat -- they'll pass out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Mamuelle, Ark., where temperatures rose above 100 Thursday,  
roadside vendor Carolyn Archer has closed down her vegetable and 
fruit stand early each day this week to avoid the afternoon heat. 
For the time when she is outside, she has tools to keep cool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an ice chest full of ice, water, juice and plenty of  
wash rags to dig down there to keep cool,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For people lucky enough to have access to fans and air  
conditioning, power companies urged them to conserve energy, 
fearing potential blackouts or brownouts due to consumer overload. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the Kentucky's largest utilities made a special plea to  
their largest customers. Both utilities set all-time peak-usage 
records for the fourth time since July 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response has been very favorable,'' said Joel Reuter, a  
spokesman for LG&AMP;E Energy Corp., the Louisville-based parent of the 
two utilities. ``I think that people and industry in the Midwest 
understand that this gripping heat wave has put a tremendous amount 
of pressure on electrical utilities in the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone was bothered by the heat. In Grand Rapids, Mich.,  
where temperatures reached 95, Jim Pikaart stood in the shade 
outside a coffee shop -- while sipping tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where I'm from, it's been really hot and really dry. This is  
really nice and breezy,'' said the Summersville, W. Va., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	In Minnesota, it reached 98 degrees on Thursday, tying a record  
set in 1933. Still, Dana Buffie spent most of her day under the sun 
riding a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents don't understand, either,'' said the 26-year-old  
said. ``I think it's beautiful. I love being out in this weather -- 
blue skies, hot and people everywhere. I like to see bodies out, 
skin exposed, people's faces.''

<HEADLINE> Rep. George E. Brown Eulogized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. George E. Brown Jr. was remembered Friday  
as a warm congressman with twinkling eyes, a commitment to justice, 
a passion for scientific research and a disdain for opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Brown was one of the greatest leaders to ever serve in  
the House of Representatives,'' Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., said 
during a memorial service at Statuary Hall in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``He belonged to the house of the people,'' Sen. Barbara Boxer,  
D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a California Democrat and the oldest member of the House  
at 79, died July 15 after a lengthy hospital stay. His family said 
he had developed an infection following heart surgery three months 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	He represented California's 42nd District, which includes the  
city of San Bernardino and other towns east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown was first elected to the House in 1962, representing the  
29th District in Los Angeles County for eight years and making a 
name for himself as an opponent of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	He was re-elected over and over even though he sometimes took  
politically unwise positions, fellow lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did not read polls,'' said Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif. ``Nobody  
ever cast more unsafe votes than George Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri remembered Brown as  
``the most successful politician that I ever met who was a 
nonpolitician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert presented Brown's widow with two  
flags that flew over the Capitol in Brown's honor on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> NBA Reopens for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Penny Hardaway's career in Orlando could be entering its final  
moments. The same might be true of Vin Baker's stint in Seattle, 
although that's a lot less likely. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith is expecting the Atlanta Hawks to trade him to  
Portland, and the Boston Celtics have been doing their utmost to 
deal Ron Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Detlef Schrempf has gotten mad at the SuperSonics,  
Charles Oakley has been hot and cold toward the Raptors, Shandon 
Anderson has flirted with leaving the Jazz, and Mitch Richmond is 
wondering whether he'll ever get his big payday. 
</P>
<P>
	Those players, along with dozens of others, will get their  
answers in the first few days of August as the NBA's one-month 
moratorium on trades and free-agent signings ends. 
</P>
<P>
	``This moratorium month has created a sense of a lack of  
urgency,'' Orlando Magic general manager John Gabriel said Friday, 
``because there has been time to talk about a variety of deals 
while at the same time negotiating contracts with the players you 
plan to have back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether the Magic plan to have Hardaway back is one of the  
biggest questions to be answered in the coming days. Hardaway opted 
out of the final three years of his contract, becoming a free 
agent, and seems to have a better chance of joining the Lakers, 
Raptors, Trail Blazers or Suns than staying in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still listening and negotiating,'' Gabriel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway seems most eager to play in a warm-weather city, but  
Portland and Toronto should be able to make better offers than the 
Lakers and Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time All-Star is one of more than 140 free agents who  
have been allowed to negotiate with all 29 teams since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players are attracting widespread interest as well.  
</P>
<P>
	With everyone on the lookout for a young, capable big man,  
players such as Lorenzen Wright of the Clippers and Jermaine O'Neal 
of the Trail Blazers have been inundated with offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade talk has been rampant, too, with Atlanta, Portland, Boston  
and Dallas among the most active teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of these teams are making panic moves,  
overreacting to what happened in a 50-game season,'' Jason Kidd of 
Phoenix said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who played with Kidd earlier this month on the U.S.  
Olympic qualifying team in Puerto Rico, has said he expects to be 
dealt to Portland for Isaiah Rider and another player, perhaps Jim 
Jackson or Kelvin Cato. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, who opted out of his contract and became a free agent,  
was leaning toward returning to Seattle -- but not without first 
considering whether he'd prefer to join the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely want to go back to Seattle, but I have to  
consider where I want to be for the next seven years of my life,'' 
Baker said. ``That's going to be based on my family and what I 
think is important for them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Boston is a place I'd love to play, simply because  
of where I'm from -- Hartford -- and where my family and friends are. 
But again, Seattle is the place I'm hopefully looking forward to 
going back to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reports surfaced late in the week that the Celtics and Mavericks  
were discussing a sign-and-trade deal that would send Mercer to 
Dallas for Samaki Walker and a future No. 1 pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston also was willing to listen to almost any offer for Kenny  
Anderson, while Golden State was willing to take back virtually 
nothing for Donyell Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics were scrambling to find a replacement for Schrempf,  
who was miffed that Seattle offered him a deal worth only $1.1 
million after he made $3.3 million last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible replacements for Schrempf include Rick Fox, Cedric  
Henderson and Cedric Ceballos. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, miffed that the Raptors haven't markedly improved their  
original offer of $12 million for three years, could be involved in 
a sign-and-trade deal for Hardaway. Reports in Toronto said the 
Raptors were considering offering Oakley and Tracy McGrady to 
Orlando for Hardaway. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley also has been courted by the Lakers and Atlanta Hawks.  
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, the backup shooting guard for Utah behind Jeff  
Hornacek, is considering relocating to San Antonio if the Jazz 
don't offer him a deal starting at more than $3 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs have suddenly found themselves with about $2.75  
million in salary cap room after the NBA granted their request for 
an injury exception to help them cope with the loss of Sean 
Elliott, who needs a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Richmond, there is interest in Golden State, Sacramento  
and Seattle, although none of those teams can pay him nearly as 
much as his current team, the Wizards.

<HEADLINE> 'Radar' Back On His Feet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dropping of the radar screen cost Gary Burgoff,  
best known for his portrayal of ``Radar'' in ``M A S H,'' a good 
deal of cash over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Burghoff told the Aug. 9 edition of People that his decision to  
turn down acting roles after his seven year stint on the popular 
series reduced his income sharply, and he was forced to file for 
bankruptcy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was down to my last $500,'' the 56-year-old said. ``The  
money ran out.''

canvas drawings of wildlife for $25,000 each; he is acting on stage 
again, and is soon to appear in the 120-city tour of Neil Simon's 
``The Last of the Red Hot Lovers''; and is the new host of the 
public television series, ``Pets: Part of the Family.''

<HEADLINE> Lions Enlist Sanders' Father Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Stunned by Barry Sanders' retirement, the Detroit  
Lions' vice chairman is planning strategy to get the running back 
to reconsider walking away from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	And to that end, William Clay Ford Jr. has enlisted some help --  
from Sanders' father, William Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Sanders said late Friday he would encourage his son to  
meet with Ford, who hopes to talk Barry into returning to the game. 
He announced his retirement on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even to William Sanders, the prospect of a meeting remained  
cloudy Friday night, given that his son is touring Europe and 
hasn't talked to his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Sanders, 31, shocked the football world Wednesday by  
announcing his retirement after 10 years, just 1,458 yards shy of 
breaking Walter Payton's NFL career rushing record of 16,726 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said in a statement his ``desire to exit the game is  
greater than my desire to remain in it'' for what would be the 
third year of a six-year, $36 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Those stunned by Sanders' move included Ford, who called  
Sanders' father at his Wichita, Kan., home Wednesday morning and 
sought his help in arranging a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I'd do everything I can,'' the elder Sanders said  
Friday night. ``The guy (Ford) really seemed like he was on the 
up-and-up, a man of his word. Just in talking to him, he seemed 
awfully impressive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to try to change (Barry's) mind, but I will ask  
him to contact Mr. Ford. I think that's only fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesman Bill Keenist on Friday night acknowledged that  
Ford spoke with the elder Sanders the day Barry Sanders announced 
his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that's the extent of what I can tell you,'' Keenist said.  
``Bill suggested that if there was anything he could do, that he 
would be available, and Mr. Sanders acknowledged that, and that was 
the extent of the discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders' retirement is not final, at least not technically. The  
Lions have put him on the reserve-did not report list, which would 
allow him to rejoin the team this season. Sanders also has not 
filed retirement papers with the league office. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still possible (Sanders could return), and that's the  
basis of placing Barry in the category that we did,'' Lions coach 
Bobby Ross said. ``We've got to proceed as though he's not going to 
be here, but I'd be very happy if he came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Wednesday at London's Gatwick Airport whether he might  
change his mind, Sanders said: ``I don't think that's going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But his father said he believes that as far as his arranging a  
meeting, ``the odds are in Mr. Ford's favor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of his son, the elder Sanders said: ``I think he'll listen to  
me. He has nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``I have no way of reaching him. In fact, I don't  
think he wants to be reached. I think he wants to just do his own 
thing.''

<HEADLINE> New Redskins Owner Visits Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FROSTBURG, Md. (AP) -- On the hottest day the Washington Redskins  
have ever experienced in the Maryland mountains, it was easy to 
spot the team's new owners. They were the ones wearing long 
trousers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting, it's fantastic,'' Daniel Snyder said on his  
first visit to training camp since buying the team for $800 
million. ``It sure is hot, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was about the only definite public pronouncement Snyder  
made before he watched practice in stifling heat unusual for the 
area. Still, he never took off the burgundy and gold tie and he and 
his father, Gerald Snyder, and another partner, Fred Drasner, 
checked out their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody know a rain dance?'' asked trainer Bubba Tyer, worried  
about the effects of the heat on his players. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder has been quick to make changes in the front office and is  
promising to be a hands-on owner. Hardly a day goes by that a 
report doesn't surface over some move he'd reportedly like to make 
-- everything from acquiring Barry Sanders, Jamal Anderson or Carl 
Pickens to changing the name of Jack Kent Cooke Stadium or moving 
camp from Frostburg to the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
	But with notepads open and cameras switched on, Snyder  
maintained his growing reputation of publicly saying nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can say is that we're looking to improve the  
Redskins,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When practice ended, helicopters landed on the field to whisk  
the Snyders and Drasner away, another first at Redskins camp. 
Before he left, Snyder held a long talk with coach Norv Turner on 
the field and also spoke at length with his hand-picked director of 
player personnel, Vinny Cerrato. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't slept lately,'' Snyder said. ``They usually talk  
to me late at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the players seemed excited to have the new big man  
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``If your boss comes into the office, I'm sure you'd shake it up  
a bit,'' long snapper Dan Turk said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Readies for Vote on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to cut taxes by $792  
billion, after dodging numerous attempts to alter or shrink it, 
headed today for passage in the Senate and the larger obstacle of a 
promised presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and top GOP tax writers met to discuss 
strategy over what could be a prolonged battle with the White House 
over the final size and shape of the tax cut. First, the House and 
Senate also have to resolve differences in their two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said they hope to reach a deal with the House and finish  
voting by the end of next week, when Congress leaves for its August 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP majority was expected to give solid backing to the  
10-year plan that would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 
percent, ease the so-called marriage penalty, reduce estate taxes 
and increase IRA contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	First though, they accepted, 98-2, an amendment by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other GOP conservatives that would 
speed up measures to reduce tax disadvantages for married couples. 
Other tax breaks in the bill would be delayed to offset the $6 
billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, GOP leaders intended to move quickly to resolve  
differences with a House-passed bill that would reach the same $792 
billion level of tax relief through different kinds of cuts. The 
bill, however, was not expected to be sent to the president until 
September, giving both supporters and opponents a chance to press 
their case during the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill  
faced a certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said 
the ``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the 
dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., promised action  
on the prescription drug issue in the fall, but ``we should not be 
pressured into simply accepting something that does require our 
most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent and increase  
the number of people eligible for that tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide relief to married couples who are pushed into a higher  
tax bracket because of their combined incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase allowable contributions to retirement funds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide deductions for health insurance costs and long-term  
care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the eligible income limits for student loan interest  
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Repeal estate tax rates in excess of 50 percent and, in 2007,  
increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Patients' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton challenged Congress today to  
debate and pass certain guaranteed rights for managed-care 
patients' before lawmakers break for summer vacation next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans, led by physicians serving in Congress, are  
joining Democrats in support of the ``patients' bill of rights'' 
concept. That has Clinton predicting a strong bill would pass if 
GOP leaders would allow a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting patients' rights shouldn't be a political issue.  
After all, no one asks us what our party affiliation when we show 
up at the emergency room or the doctor's office,'' Clinton said in 
his weekly radio address. ``This isn't a partisan issue anywhere 
else in America. It shouldn't be in Washington, D.C.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed a weaker bill than the Clinton  
administration and almost all Democrats on Capitol Hill are 
pushing. House GOP leaders had planned to put a similar bill on the 
floor this week, which they said was necessary to get it passed 
before their vacation, but Republican defections to the Democratic 
bill prevented action. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans contend the sweeping Democratic plans would be  
too expensive. They want a limited bill that would give patients 
new rights of appeal but no right to sue a health management 
organization that denies care. That legislation also would give 
doctors some new power without removing an HMO's right to determine 
what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	On his address, which the president taped in Europe for  
broadcast today, Clinton said he has made wider protections 
available to 85 million Americans who use federal plans such as 
those under Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidence shows putting in patients' rights raised the cost of  
these plans by only a dollar a month; so we know these rights are 
affordable, as well as crucial,'' the president said. ``Yet, until 
Congress acts, tens of millions of Americans in managed care are 
still waiting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a few House Republicans signal their willingness for a  
stronger bill, Clinton said, ``There is a bipartisan consensus 
emerging behind a bill that would give all Americans the health 
protections they need. This bill should be debated and voted on 
this coming week, before Congress adjourns for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that happens, I believe the bill would pass and the  
American people would benefit.''

<HEADLINE>  Broncos' Jones Is Fashion Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- He has two Super Bowl rings to go with 70  
suits ranging in color from peach to lime-green, and he's a 
romantic who married his wife on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver offensive lineman Tony Jones even has a street named  
after him in Ty Cobb's hometown of Royston, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things you usually get when you're dead, not  
when you're alive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones knows what it's like to be both. He died and came back to  
life during seemingly routine elbow surgery four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an allergic reaction to some of the medicine they gave  
me and had a heart attack,'' Jones said. ``My heart stopped. They 
tried to shock me, and it didn't work. They gave me adrenaline and 
brought me back. I think it was just God's way of telling me he can 
stop me when he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If someone was looking out for him, Jones has an appropriate way  
of returning the favor as he makes an anonymous living protecting 
quarterbacks and opening holes for MVP running back Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The unassuming work was rewarded last season when Davis became  
the fourth back in NFL history to run for 2,000 yards and Jones was 
selected to his first Pro Bowl after 11 seasons with Cleveland, 
Baltimore and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a huge man, a massive man,'' said Davis, who bought Jones  
and the other linemen golf clubs for their efforts. ``Having him on 
that left side means a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his lack of notoriety, Jones dresses like a 6-foot-5,  
290-pound movie star trying to impress the paparazzi at a Hollywood 
premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	His wardrobe consists of suits for all occasions, including a  
team-spirit ensemble with navy blue pants, a Broncos-orange jacket 
and orange alligator-skin shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	If Crayola makes the color, Jones wears it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have different colors for different moods,'' he said. ``I  
like to dress flamboyantly because I like a lot of colors. I'm not 
scared to throw on peach or red or lime-green. A lot of big guys 
are, and I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fashion statement has not carried over to other Broncos  
lineman and Jones has long given up trying to turn his teammates 
into a weighty group of Deion Sanders impersonators. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's unique,'' said guard Mark Schlereth. ``He knows none of  
us could pull off the wardrobe that he has. He's the only guy that 
could pull that off.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Donovan McNabb, who ended his holdout by signing a  
seven-year, $54 million contract, missed both of the Eagles' 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's 32-page contract was so long and complicated that by  
the time the NFL let him sign it, it was too late to join his new 
team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Amani Toomer, whose last-minute touchdown catch  
knocked the Denver Broncos from the undefeated ranks last season, 
signed a four-year, $11.2 million contract with the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-year player received a $3.5 million signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars signed free-agent linebacker Lonnie Marts to take  
the place of Bryce Paup, who is recovering from a torn pectoral 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Marts, a nine-year veteran, started 15 games with the Tennessee  
Oilers last season. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Andre Reed, the team's only holdout, is expected  
to arrive at camp in time for Sunday night's team meeting. Reed is 
said to be in agreement with the Bills on a contract extension, 
although the team wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Jerome Bettis, whose troublesome left knee swelled  
at Friday's practice, said he felt better after a brief running 
session during Saturday's morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, center Dermontti Dawson was injured during a pileup during  
the afternoon practice. The preliminary prognosis was a sprained 
medial collateral ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Chargers    	
</P>
<P>
	Free safety Darren Perry retired, the day before the Chargers  
were to fly to Australia for their exhibition opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Riley said the seven-year veteran knocked on his door  
at 7:30 a.m. and told him he was retiring due to an ailment in his 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons learned that running back Gary Downs and rookie  
center Todd McClure both suffered season-ending knee injuries at 
practice a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs sustained a torn lateral collateral ligament, while  
McClure tore an anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pete Carroll and starting strong safety Lawyer Milloy said  
they've buried the hatchet, one day after the Pro Bowl defensive 
back blasted team management for releasing veteran safety Willie 
Clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Milloy, a fourth-year veteran, apologized for having expressed  
private feelings publicly. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rae Carruth, making a comeback from a fractured  
right foot last season that required surgery, has looked very good 
two days into training camp. Carruth has made one impressive catch 
after another in a push to recover from a lost season in which he 
played only two games. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have waived punter Jeff Baker and quarterback Chuck  
Clements, coach Mike Shanahan said. Baker and Clements both joined 
the team as free agents during the offseason.

<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- What the Women's World Cup started in  
the United States, those at the Pan American Games hope to push a 
little more down the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after the second Women's Football  
Symposium in Los Angeles finished with a call for more women's 
age-limited tournaments -- and specifically a world championship -- 
five under-20 national teams have gathered in Winnipeg to compete 
for only the second confederation-sanctioned youth crown offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very positive to have this competition immediately after  
the World Cup,'' said Mexican coach Leonardo Cuellar, who also 
coached Mexico's women's team at USA '99 and brought five members 
of that squad to Winnipeg. ``The TV is here. This is being shown in 
Mexico. It is giving exposure to what needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Pan Ams starting only 13 days after the Women's World  
Cup final, CONCACAF, which was given virtual control of the event, 
decided to make it an under-20 competition. 
</P>
<P>
	That limited the number of countries participating because most  
nations barely field a senior national team, let alone an underage 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the United States sent essentially its under-18  
team because of its commitment to the Nordic Cup, an annual 
invitational that for a little less than a decade has stood as a de 
facto youth championship. 
</P>
<P>
	That eight-team event is set for Iceland on Aug. 2-8.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's obvious to the rest of the world that we're being  
very aggressive in an area of the game that needs promotion,'' 
CONCACAF deputy general secretary Ted Howard said. ``We also know 
we need to promote it in our member nations where it may not be the 
most accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only last week, CONCACAF joined Asia, Africa, Europe and South  
America in announcing that next year it will stage a continental 
championship for women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pan Ams is only the second non-exhibition title for  
girls, following in the path of last year's European under-18 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's clear those associated with the women's programs are  
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tremendous for our younger players,'' said Canada  
coach Neil Turnbull, who like Cuellar coached his country's senior 
team at the Women's World Cup. ``One thing we lack is World 
Cup-level experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to bring a new girl into the national team, her  
first cap might be against the United States -- the best team in the 
world. Her second might be against China. (The Pan Ams) is 
international soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles two days before the World Cup final, Per Ravn  
Omdal of Norway, chairman of FIFA's Committee for Women's Football, 
said the creation of more women's championships, and specifically 
youth events, would spur confederations and national associations 
into creating and supporting women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is also the concern youth tournaments will widen the  
gap between the haves and have nots of women's soccer. The belief 
is that already developed powers will further improve, while others 
will become discouraged from getting pounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly at the Pan Ams, the United States, Canada and Mexico are  
in one tier, with Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago in another. 
</P>
<P>
	In four games, the Americans and Canadians routed Costa Rica and  
Trinidad by a combined score of 25-2. The scores were similar to 
some seen during World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talent pool (at the youth level), despite gains, is not  
that big,'' 1999 Women's World Cup spokesman Aaron Heifetz said 
from his office in Los Angeles. ``It's much tougher for developing 
nations to put together teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, even for those that get pummeled, some see positives.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on what you do with it, how you view it,'' said  
U.S. coach Jay Hoffman, who also used to coach the U.S. men's 
under-20 team. ``It depends on what you do as a follow-up. If 
somebody just brought a team here, but doesn't do anything until a 
year from now ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If you bring a team in here, and next month you do a little  
more, and then a little more ... I assume all countries here are 
attempting to improve. If that's the case, it will only help sport, 
only help the confederation.''

that big,'' 1999 Women's World Cup spokesman Aaron Heifetz said 
from his office in Los Angeles. ``It's much tougher for developing 
nations to put together teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, even for those that get pummeled, some see positives.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on what you do with it, how you view it,'' said  
U.S. coach Jay Hoffman, who also used to coach the U.S. men's 
under-20 team. ``It depends on what you do as a follow-up. If 
somebody just brought a team here, but doesn't do anything until a 
year from now ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If you bring a team in here, and next month you do a little  
more, and then a little more ... I assume all countries here are 
attempting to improve. If that's the case, it will only help sport, 
only help the confederation.''

</P>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Leo V. Berger, one of the country's  
biggest shipping magnates, who helped revitalize the U.S. merchant 
marine fleet, died July 24 of a heart attack. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger began working to rebuild America's dying international  
shipping business in 1967 with the federally subsidized purchase of 
an oil tanker for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Berger built up his Apex Marine Corp. of Lake  
Success, N.Y., which had an estimated $100 million annual revenue 
and a fleet of 24 ships at its high point in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	As the market soured in recent years, Berger began selling  
ships. He sold two to the U.S. Navy and helped transform them into 
1,100-bed hospitals serving American troops. The ships are still in 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian immigrant came to the United States with his  
family in 1928 and settled in New York City. He was inducted into 
the U.S. Merchant Marine's Hall of Distinguished Graduates last 
year.

</P>
<P>
	The guitar craftsman, who had recently suffered a heart attack  
and had been in and out of the hospital with complications, died at 
his East Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
	Delgado and older brother, Candelario, who died in 1983, opened  
Candelas Guitars in East Los Angeles in 1948. It is currently run

<HEADLINE> First Lady: Husband Has 'Weakness' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, answering  
questions about her husband's affair with former White House intern 
Monica Lewinsky and the scandal that followed, said his actions 
were ``a sin of weakness, not a sin of malice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton defended President Clinton as ``a very, very good  
man'' but said, ``Yes, he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more 
responsible, more disciplined,'' she told ``Talk'' magazine, 
according to a news release from the magazine Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, edited by former New Yorker editor Tina Brown,  
debuts on newsstands Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Questioned about the president's infidelity, Mrs. Clinton said,  
``I thought this was resolved ten years ago. ... I thought he had 
conquered it,'' according to a magazine press release. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also said her husband was scarred by abuse as a  
small child, but the press release did not provide details. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also talked about her moves toward a run for a U.S.  
Senate seat in New York. ``Now for the first time I am making my 
own decisions. I can feel the difference. It is a great relief.''

<HEADLINE> Religious Conservatives Back Forbes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Publisher Steve Forbes' effort to  
broaden his political base got a boost Saturday when a dozen 
conservative religious leaders signed a letter declaring him a 
leader of ``America's new conservative movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows that the liberties we enjoy are rooted in faith,''  
said the letter, mailed to conservative activists around the state 
where precinct caucuses in February launch the presidential 
nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissemination of the letter follows a bizarre week in which the  
head of the Iowa section of the Christian Coalition of America 
charged that Forbes approached her temporary employment agency 
about hiring people to vote for him in Iowa's August straw poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes denied the charge by Bobbi Gobel, and she issued a  
statement backing away from the claim. The organization fired her 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement letter, which Forbes aides said was in the works  
months before the Gobel brouhaha, was signed by prominent ministers 
and activists who have played an important role among religious 
conservatives for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' aides said the endorsement is aimed at demonstrating the  
candidate's inroads toward bridging a gap that dogged his last 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	When Forbes sought the GOP presidential nomination in 1996,  
social conservatives were deeply suspicious of his commitment to 
issues such as opposing abortion. After focusing almost exclusively 
on a flat income-tax system, he was forced from the race. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Forbes has devoted heavy attention to conservative  
issues, promising, for example, that as president he would appoint 
only judges opposed to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	In their endorsement letter, the religious leaders said Forbes  
is ``a leader of America's new conservative movement. He believes 
in freedom and he knows that the freedom we enjoy is a gift from 
God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was signed by pastors Greg Altizer, of Cedar Rapids;  
Jan Burns, of Farmington; Don Culp, of Keokuk; Michael Erpelding, 
of Fort Dodge; John Graham, of Belle Plaine; Robert Grossman, of 
Garner; Morris Hurd, of Kellogg; Laddie Oliver, of Keosauqua; and 
Brad Sherman, of Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
	It also got the backing of Keith Fournier, former head of the  
Catholic Alliance. Also signing on were Steve Scheffler, former 
field director of the Iowa Christian Coalition, and prominent 
religious conservative leader Nancy Streck. 
</P>
<P>
	``As never before we need someone who is willing to lead a  
cultural renewal in America,'' the letter said. ``We need someone 
who is not afraid to speak out for the things he believes, a return 
to the time when life was more valuable than choice, when children 
could pray to God in school without fear of reprisal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter urges conservative activists to show up at the straw  
poll and vote for Forbes. ``The Forbes campaign will provide 
transportation, registration, food and entertainment,'' the letter 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gobel episode ended Friday with a terse statement from the  
Christian Coalition's national headquarters that Gobel ``has been 
dismissed.'' It said the state board was being reorganized. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement also said the Christian Coalition ``sincerely  
regrets any inappropriate and inaccurate public statements that 
have recently been made regarding presidential campaigns or 
candidates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gobel long has been hostile toward Forbes, which caused some to  
suspect her motives. Adding to that, she told reporters she was 
upset that the large number of candidates courting conservatives 
divided their vote and weakened their influence. 
</P>
<P>
	About Forbes, she said when she made the straw poll allegations:  
``I don't buy the conversion.''

cellist and one of the most colorful figures of the musical and 
social world of the 1960s, died Tuesday. She was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Having begun playing cello at an early age, Ms. Fleming won a  
spot at the Royal College of Music in 1943. She established herself 
throughout the 1950s, eventually choosing to concentrate on chamber 
music. She later became a professor of cello at the Royal College 
of Music.

treatment of certain skin cancers with topical chemicals, died 
Saturday. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein was among the first to recognize the need for nonsurgical  
therapies for superficial skin cancer like that arising from 
prolonged exposure to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	He also advanced the use of immunotherapy, in which agents are  
applied to stimulate the immune system, enabling the body to fend 
off tumors. The method pointed the way toward the use of interferon 
and interleukins in cancer therapy today.

<HEADLINE> Judge Keeps Hospital Restraint Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A challenge by hospitals and mental health  
care providers to new proposed federal regulations on the use of 
restraints in hospitals was dismissed Friday by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, which were announced in June by the Health Care  
Financing Administration, prohibit the use of restraints and 
seclusion as a means for coercion, discipline, convenience or 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems and the  
American Hospital Association contested a provision requiring a 
physician or licensed practitioner to meet face-to-face with and 
evaluate the patient within one hour of being placed in seclusion 
or restraints. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups sought a temporary injunction against enforcement  
of the provision, saying that it was a major change in practice and 
merited further discussion. They proposed a substitute that would 
have allowed the doctor to consult with the patient's nurse within 
an hour and determine whether to come in immediately or give orders 
over the phone and come in at a later point. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Gladys Kessler dismissed their motion  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Covall, executive director of the National Association of  
Psychiatric Health Systems, said the group supports the overall 
regulations, but feared that provision would cause substanital 
hardship to physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the groups will continue to work with the administration  
on the regulations, which are to go into effect in late August.

	DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Twenty factory workers were injured,  
some seriously, when a car driven by an alleged drunken driver 
slammed into the back of a bus that was carrying them to work, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several passengers were ejected from the small bus about 10 p.m.  
Friday after the collision caused it to hit a power pole on 
Interstate 355 and tip over, police Master Sgt. Luis Tigera said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was headed from an employment agency's pickup point in  
suburban Cicero to TDI Batteries Inc. in Downers Grove. The

	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars signed  
free-agent linebacker Lonnie Marts on Saturday to take the place of 
the injured Bryce Paup. 
</P>
<P>
	Marts, a nine-year veteran, started 15 games with the Tennessee  
Oilers last season. He has also started for the Kansas City Chiefs

	Heat Wave Linked to 94 Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cool air from Canada is bringing relief from the  
heat to parts of the Midwest and forecasters say a cold front 
should cause temperatures to drop in Michigan, Iowa and Nebraska 
today. Storms last night have already cooled things off in 
Wisconsin and Minnesota. In Chicago, where the heat index neared 
120 yesterday, forecasters say relief is expected tonight from a 
cool front moving into the region. The current heat wave has been 
linked to at least 94 deaths across the country since July 19. The 
Midwest has been hardest hit, with Missouri logging 29 heat-related 
deaths, Illinois 23 and 10 in Ohio.

House over the size and scope of the tax cut they hope to give the 
American people in the next decade. The Senate yesterday approved a 
$792 billion tax plan that mirrors an earlier House-passed bill in 
size but differs in the kinds of tax relief included. The vote was 
57-43, mostly along party lines. President Clinton has said 
repeatedly he will veto the GOP plans because they are three times

in the Swiss Alps, police said today. The discovery brings to 20 
the number of people confirmed killed in the flash flood. The body 
was found last night in Lake Brienz, about 2 1/2 miles downstream from 
the scene of the accident, at a depth of more than 200 feet, Bern 
state police said. The people were swept away as they bodysurfed 
down the fast-running Saxeten Brook on Tuesday near this central

watching from the Earth failed to detect a dust cloud, a result 
that some called ``a bit of a disappointment.'' The lack of dust, 
however, does not mean that a search for evidence of water on the 
moon has failed, experts said. Telescopes, using ultraviolet 
filters, will continue to look for clues that water vapor was 
splashed into the lunar sky by the impact.

trading and free-agency period begins, the newspaper said in

<HEADLINE> GOP Braces for Battle on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate Republicans are moving  
quickly to join forces for the coming battle against the White 
House over the size and scope of the tax cut they hope to present 
to the American people in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Friday approved a $792 billion tax plan that  
mirrors an earlier House-passed bill in size but differs in the 
kinds of tax relief included. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43, mostly along party lines.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said repeatedly he would veto the GOP  
plans because they are three times what he thinks the economy can 
safely digest amid efforts to ensure the solvency of Social 
Security and Medicare and pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate made the wrong choice for America's future,''  
Clinton said in a statement Friday. ``By pushing through a tax plan 
that is too big and too bloated, the majority party has pushed 
aside our vital national priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said congressional  
tax specialists would begin talks as early as today, and that a 
House-Senate conference could be held early next week to pave the 
way for final passage of a compromise plan at week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	There is some urgency because Congress recesses at the end of  
the week for its month-long summer vacation. But Lott indicated the 
final bill would not be sent to the president until Congress 
returns in September, avoiding a veto while lawmakers are away from 
Washington and giving them a chance to make their case to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the American people understand what we  
have done,'' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, 
R-N.M. ``We'd like to get our message across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott began that message campaign today in the weekly Republican  
radio address. With the federal budget projected to show a $3.4 
trillion surplus in the next decade, he asked, ``shouldn't you be 
able to keep more of what you earn, for your household needs, or to 
save for your family's future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't selfish to want lower taxes. You know your family  
pays too much for government. I know it. And so does the president. 
But he wants that cash for spending here in Washington,'' Lott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton and most Democrats say that if Social Security  
revenues are put aside, the surplus amounts to about $1 trillion, 
and the GOP plans would put nearly all of that into tax cuts -- 
ignoring education, defense and other programs and doing little to 
fix Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP course ``can best be characterized as one of both  
wishful thinking and fiscal disaster,'' said Senate Democratic 
leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The main elements of the Senate plan include a reduction in the  
bottom 15 percent income tax bracket to 14 percent and expansion of 
the number of taxpayers eligible for that bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase the standard deduction for married couples in  
2001 and allow those couples to file returns as singles in a 
combined form starting in 2005. That would help to eliminate 
situations in which married people pay more than singles because 
their combined incomes forces them into a higher bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would raise the exemption for estate taxes from  
$1 million to $1.5 million in 2007 and raise annual contribution 
limits for individual retirement accounts from $2,000 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The big difference in the House bill is that it provides for an  
across-the-board 10 percent cut in tax rates. It also cuts the top 
capital gains tax rate for most investments held at least a year 
from 20 percent to 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, who backed a failed attempt to include an across-the-board  
cut in the Senate bill, said he wasn't sure the House-Senate 
conference would move in that direction, but ``if it were that or 
anything else in this bill I'd take that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four Democrats -- Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Mary Landrieu  
and John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- voted for 
the GOP plan, while Republicans Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and 
George Voinovich of Ohio opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, who earlier backed an unsuccessful attempt by  
Democratic and Republican moderates to push a $500 billion tax cut, 
said he thought that approach would eventually prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the political script gets played out, the bipartisan  
plan will serve as a blueprint for an October solution that bridges 
the divergent positions on tax cuts,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Heat Wave at 96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As Chicago baked in 100-degree weather, thousands  
of hot and sweaty residents were forced to endure the heat without 
air conditioning or fans, due to sporadic power outages and 
brownouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hour they say it's going to be back on. Nothing,'' Anna  
Losada, who lost power in her home, said Friday. ``It's ridiculous. 
We got to pay them every month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago residents were not the only ones suffering in extreme  
heat. A wide strip of the nation, from the central states to the 
East Coast, baked for another day Friday with some temperatures 
over 100 degrees and a heat index -- the combination of heat and 
humidity -- near 120. 
</P>
<P>
	The current heat wave has been linked to at least 96 deaths  
across the country since July 19. The Midwest has been hardest hit, 
with Missouri logging 29 heat-related deaths, Illinois 23 and 10 in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll rose from 94 to 96 today.  
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, Chambers County coroner Dave Collier said today that  
Odell Walker, 84, died Friday at her home in Lafayette, Ala., the 
state's first heat-related death. Ms. Walker had air conditioning 
in her home but had not turned it on, he said. The high temperature 
in the state was 99 degrees on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the News &AMP; Observer (of Raleigh, N.C.,) reported  
that a migrant farm worker died after collapsing while working last 
week in 98-degree heat. The worker had a body temperature of 108 
degrees when he was brought to Duke University Medical Center. His 
death had not been reported earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country Friday, the heat wave was widespread and  
relentless. In Missouri, several cities recorded the 15th straight 
day of temperatures in the 90s. Nashville set a record high of 101, 
breaking the old mark set in 1954. It was 99 in Chattanooga, Tenn., 
tying the mark set in 1952. In other areas, it was 104 degrees in 
Louisville, Ky., 102 degrees in Kenosha, Wis., and 99 degrees in 
Winona, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	While some areas were due to get some relief from the heat,  
other cities braced for more of the same over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	As the temperature peaked at 104 degrees Friday at Chicago's  
Midway Airport, up to 100,000 homes and businesses began feeling 
the electricity -- along with cool stream of air conditioning -- shut 
off. Power companies blamed excessive demand for the outage. Full 
power was not expected to be restored until later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a week of temperatures that were just building up  
every day going toward 100 degrees. We're setting peak demand 
records every day,'' said Chicago's Commonwealth Edison spokesman 
Keith Bromery. ``That's put a real strain on the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While other states were able to avoid such problems, utilities  
issued warnings asking consumers to cut back on usage to prevent 
possible outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was so bad in central Arkansas that Danny Mahan, safety  
director for a construction company there, said workers pouring 
concrete have been going to work at about 3 a.m. to avoid the 
afternoon heat. He's been encouraging workers to drink plenty of 
water before they hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the younger guys think they can get a drink when it  
starts heating up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even pro athletes had trouble playing outdoors. In Chicago,  
Jimmy Connors withdrew from a seniors tennis tournament and two 
Cubs players took themselves out of a baseball game with the New 
York Mets because of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to quit. I called the trainer and said, `I can't  
take it,''' Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outages were the biggest worry in Chicago Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Several high-rise buildings with elderly were (partially)  
evacuated. Some of our cooling centers were down, and our 311 
number was overwhelmed by calls from people who couldn't get 
through to Commonwealth Edison and they wanted to report the 
outages,'' said city spokesman Terry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also made special efforts to get to the elderly, trying  
to avoid a repeat of the summer of 1995, when more than 700 elderly 
residents died in extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Police Officer Mike Sanders began the day checking to  
see how senior citizens were faring in the heat. He had to rescue 
81-year-old Mary Powls, lying on the floor of her apartment with 
her windows closed, fan off and no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders later checked on her in the hospital, where she was  
admitted in stable condition with a 104-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing that we came around when we did,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the elderly, intense heat can also be daunting for the  
homeless, if they have no shelter from the sun's rays. But in 
Louisville, Ky., which hit 106 on Friday, Bill Tracy has managed to 
find some places to keep cool during the day, such as the library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to keep myself dressed well so I can slip into  
places,'' said Tracy, who goes to a shelter at night.

<HEADLINE> Senate Readies for Vote on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to cut taxes by $792  
billion, after dodging numerous attempts to alter or shrink it, 
headed today for passage in the Senate and the larger obstacle of a 
promised presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and top GOP tax writers met to discuss 
strategy over what could be a prolonged battle with the White House 
over the final size and shape of the tax cut. First, the House and 
Senate also have to resolve differences in their two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said they hope to reach a deal with the House and finish  
voting by the end of next week, when Congress leaves for its August 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP majority was expected to give solid backing to the  
10-year plan that would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 
percent, ease the so-called marriage penalty, reduce estate taxes 
and increase IRA contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	First though, they accepted, 98-2, an amendment by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other GOP conservatives that would 
speed up measures to reduce tax disadvantages for married couples. 
Other tax breaks in the bill would be delayed to offset the $6 
billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, GOP leaders intended to move quickly to resolve  
differences with a House-passed bill that would reach the same $792 
billion level of tax relief through different kinds of cuts. The 
bill, however, was not expected to be sent to the president until 
September, giving both supporters and opponents a chance to press 
their case during the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill  
faced a certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said 
the ``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the 
dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., promised action  
on the prescription drug issue in the fall, but ``we should not be 
pressured into simply accepting something that does require our 
most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent and increase  
the number of people eligible for that tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide relief to married couples who are pushed into a higher  
tax bracket because of their combined incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase allowable contributions to retirement funds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide deductions for health insurance costs and long-term  
care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the eligible income limits for student loan interest  
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Repeal estate tax rates in excess of 50 percent and, in 2007,  
increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> Tripp Indicted on Wiretap Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- Linda Tripp's secret recordings of  
phone conversations with Monica Lewinsky were meant to bring 
presidential misconduct to light, and she should be praised, not 
prosecuted, her lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A Maryland grand jury thought otherwise, indicting Mrs. Tripp on  
state wiretapping charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, which followed a yearlong investigation, makes  
Mrs. Tripp the only major figure in the sex scandal to face a 
criminal charge. Each offense carries up to five years in prison 
and a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripp spokesman Philip Coughter called the investigation ``the  
most disgraceful, transparent campaign of politically motivated 
vengeance in recent American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp's new attorney Stephen Kohn, who has handled numerous  
government whistle-blower cases, compared her to civil rights 
heroes who broke minor state laws to battle injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	He said federal law protects Mrs. Tripp as a government witness  
in a corruption case. Kohn said he will challenge the state's 
authority to bring charges because she was given immunity by 
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr when she turned over the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn likened the Maryland investigation to the McCarthy-era  
communist witch hunts and said Friday's indictment ``will have a 
chilling effect on witnesses who have the courage to document and 
report official misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli, who led the grand jury  
investigation, said simply, ``I think she broke the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He waved off suggestions that the case would be viewed as  
politically motivated. ``I can't help how it will be seen. ... I 
think we've done our duty,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montanarelli, a Democrat appointed to his post in 1984, said he  
would handle the case himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury indicted Mrs. Tripp on one count of illegal  
interception, for taping a phone conversation on Dec. 22, 1997, 
after she was told by her lawyer that secret taping was illegal. In 
conversations taped that day, the two women discussed what they 
should say about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with Clinton in 
testimony they expected to have to give for Paula Jones' sexual 
harassment lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp also was charged with disclosing the contents of that  
conversation to Newsweek magazine, which published a partial 
transcript of a Tripp-Lewinsky phone call on Feb. 2, 1998. A 
spokeswoman for Newsweek, Jan Angilella, said magazine officials 
would not comment on the proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House and representatives of Ms. Lewinsky also  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Mrs. Tripp's more than 20 hours of recordings that  
launched the independent counsel's investigation of Clinton's 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings of the two women's rambling and sometimes ribald  
conversations were released publicly by the House Judiciary 
Committee before the House voted to impeach Clinton for perjury and 
obstruction. He was acquitted Feb. 12 after a Senate trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland's wiretap law, which is infrequently prosecuted,  
forbids taping phone conversations without the other party's 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignorance of the law is a valid defense. But Mrs. Tripp, who  
recorded the calls in her Columbia, Md., living room, testified for 
Starr's grand jury that she taped several conversations in late 
1997 even after an attorney told her it was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp will be allowed to arrange a time to surrender  
voluntarily, her attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp, 49, has said she began taping her friend's phone  
calls to protect herself because she was being pressured by Ms. 
Lewinsky to lie in Mrs. Jones' lawsuit against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky confided her sexual encounters with the president  
to Mrs. Tripp after the pair became friends while working together 
at the Pentagon. Ms. Lewinsky wanted Mrs. Tripp to deny knowledge 
of the relationship in an affidavit for Mrs. Jones' sexual 
harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr gave Ms. Lewinsky immunity from prosecution in return for  
her testimony against Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who testified in Starr's  
investigation last November, said she had urged Mrs. Tripp to start 
taping. Mrs. Tripp also talked with her about writing a tell-all 
book about her years at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached by phone in New York, Ms. Goldberg said, ``Now she will  
be able to have her day in court and tell her side of the story.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The New York Mets picked up veteran infielder  
Shawon Dunston from the St. Louis Cardinals just before the trading 
deadline Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, who broke out of an 0-for-24 slump with two hits  
Saturday, is batting .307 with five homers and 25 RBIs in 150 
at-bats. He cost the Mets minor league infielder Craig Paquette, 
30, who was assigned to Triple-A Memphis.

<P>
	Paquette is currently with the U.S. Pan American team. He hit a  
two-run home run Thursday in an upset of Cuba in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston has been a shortstop most of his career, but has also  
played some outfield the last few years.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Still Rolling at Dover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Before he drove his first lap at Dover Downs  
International Speedway, John Hollansworth Jr. had his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	As a law school graduate, he likes to weigh all evidence before  
accepting anything. So when confronted with testimony that nothing 
could be any tougher than Dover Downs, Hollansworth had trouble 
believing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was reading the driver quotes on my laptop last night,  
especially Eddie Cheever about how physically demanding this track 
is and his comparison to Monte Carlo,'' Hollansworth said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Monte Carlo street course, where Cheever raced in Formula  
One, is reputed to be the most difficult driving test of any in the 
world. Cheever says Dover is equally demanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't believe him ... until I got out there,'' Hollansworth  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he did, Hollansworth learned the feeling of racing 180 mph  
into sharp, highly banked turns where gravity fights against 
centrifugal force. Then he drove in a fashion belying his rookie 
status in the Indy Racing League. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was our first time out here,'' he said after running the  
fifth-fastest lap Friday as practice began for Sunday's MBNA 
Mid-Atlantic 200. ``We have never tested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Boat also heard tales of racing on the concrete surface  
called White Lightning. Because he missed the race last year -- the 
first open-wheel event in Dover since 1969 -- with an injury, Boat 
also was unsure how difficult the track could be. 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, he wondered no longer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can see why they call this place The Monster Mile,'' Boat  
said. ``I can see it's going to be hard on the drivers and 
equipment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner-driver Cheever knows that all too well. After the driver  
collected $1.4 million for winning the 1998 Indianapolis 500, the 
owner lost $800,000 when both Cheever and teammate Robby Unser 
wrecked at Dover. But the physical demands created by 24 degrees of 
banking in the turns and 9 degrees on the straightaways concern 
Cheever the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're never truly flat with your steering wheel, never on  
center,'' he said. ``It takes a lot of effort, and at the end of 
the day you're spent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because his fastest lap, posted at 182.066 mph, was second only  
to points leader Scott Goodyear, Cheever spent no time worrying 
about his Infiniti engine -- the only power plant of its kind in the 
IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are definitely in better shape horsepower-wise now than we  
were at this time last year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that newfound power will be enough to outrun Goodyear is  
unknown. His Aurora engine took him around the track on his fastest 
lap in 19.476 seconds, at 182.315 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``The track was very fast, and much better than it was last  
year,'' Goodyear said of the smoothed-out surface. ``We ran in some 
close contact, and the car seems OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was somewhat of a relief to Goodyear, the only two-time  
winner on the circuit this year. He had to make a change early into 
the morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The car we initially came here to run, unfortunately, I had  
problems with it,'' he said. ``It didn't feel right on the first 
two or three warmup laps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pitted twice, making chassis adjustments both times to his  
Aurora-powered G Force. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked for things and couldn't find them, so we had to put  
the backup car out, and only got about 10 minutes in the early 
session,'' he said. ``But things went well in the last session, and 
we're quite pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-fastest was defending race champion Scott Sharp, a victory  
short of becoming the first IRL driver to win five times in his 
career. His Dallara-Aurora went 182.030. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dismore, Sharp's Kelley Racing teammate, was fourth-fastest  
at 181.938, followed by the Dallara-Aurora of Hollansworth, who 
went 181.378.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut  
through the Senate on Friday, courting a classic veto struggle this 
fall with President Clinton and Democrats who claim the measure 
shortchanges Medicare and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43 -- largely along party lines -- in favor of the  
GOP plan. The 10-year measure includes broad-based tax relief as 
well as provisions designed to address the so-called marriage 
penalty and make it easier to accumulate retirement savings and pay 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage was followed by the beginning of efforts at forging a  
quick House-Senate compromise. Congressional GOP leaders hope to 
speed the final measure through both houses next week, although it 
won't be sent to Clinton until after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave time for the GOP rank and file to trumpet the  
benefits of tax cuts during Congress' long August break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of projected 
federal surpluses. ``That's what this fighting is all about. We are 
determined to give working Americans the tax relief they are 
entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wasted little time renewing his oft-stated veto threat.  
``The Republican tax cut is so large it would undo our fiscal 
discipline and imperil our prosperity,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``It would crowd out our commitments to pay down the 
debt, to save Social Security and to strengthen and modernize 
Medicare with a long overdue prescription drug benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure includes a reduction from 15 percent to 14  
percent in the lowest personal income tax bracket, effective in 
2001. Beginning in 2006, it would gradually shift some income 
currently taxed at 28 percent into that lower bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes provisions to reduce the marriage penalty, in  
part by slowly raising the standard deduction for married couples 
to double the amount allowed for individuals. Individuals currently 
may claim $4,300, and couples $7,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before final passage, the measure was amended to let  
investors exclude from taxes the first $1,000 in long-term capital 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, more students would be allowed to deduct the  
interest on their education loans; limits on deductible 
contributions to individual retirement accounts would rise 
gradually to $5,000, and there would be liberalized tax incentives 
for individual and corporate donors to charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would create a new deduction for the cost of  
long-term care insurance, and raise the estate tax exemption -- 
already scheduled to increase to $1 million -- up to $1.5 million in 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout three days of debate on the Senate floor, Republicans  
said their budget would set aside the vast bulk of projected 
surpluses for Social Security. The tax cuts, they stressed, would 
consume less than 24 cents of each dollar of predicted surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said Sen.  
William V. Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee and 
architect of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and the president contended the GOP bill would dip  
into Social Security surpluses beginning in 2005, and leave little 
or nothing for other domestic programs. They also said that by 
providing tax cuts based on economic forecasts that might not 
materialize, the Republicans were risking a return to the days of 
large federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another riverboat gamble with the American economy,''  
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in an echo of the rhetoric used in 
the early 1980s when Republicans cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a smaller tax cut of $290 billion,  
which was rejected earlier in the week. Efforts to fashion a 
bipartisan compromise at $500 billion collapsed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A final compromise is still a possibility at year's end, but the  
immediate prospect is for a veto confrontation driven by competing 
readings of the electorate's wishes 15 months before the next 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who called their measure the Taxpayer Refund Act of  
1999, hope they can force Clinton to bend to their wishes on tax 
cuts, and say the president and other Democrats will pay a 
political price otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, believe they can frame the debate as a  
choice between risky, overlarge tax cuts on one side, and the fate 
of Medicare and other politically popular programs on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the three days of floor debate, both sides sought to  
shore up potential weaknesses in their position. For their part, 
Republicans parried Democratic claims about Medicare by pledging to 
address the issue of prescription drugs this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats abandoned Clinton's initial approach of targeted tax  
relief in favor of broad-based tax cuts, although on a far smaller 
scale than the GOP wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on the 2000 elections, when eight first-term  
Republican senators will seek new terms, Democrats forced a series 
of politically charged votes, including one on a proposal to reduce 
the tax cut to make room for prescription drug benefits for 
Medicare recipients. The amendment failed. 
</P>
<P>
	On final passage, the bill was supported by 52 Republicans, Sen.  
Bob Smith, I-N.H., and Democrats Mary Landrieu and John Breaux of 
Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey. In opposition, there were 43 Democrats and two Republicans, 
George Voinovich of Ohio and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., outlined an ambitious schedule that calls for a compromise 
by Tuesday, with final votes in the two chambers by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous differences between the bills. One is a  
House-passed provision that calls for a 10 percent across-the-board 
income tax cut rather than the reduced income tax bracket the 
Senate approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters ``there's a lot of support'' among Senate  
Republicans for an across-the-board cut, adding, ``That is the 
fairest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will fall to Lott and Hastert to prod the chairmen of the  
tax-writing committees, Roth and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, to 
avoid prolonged haggling that would slow the broader GOP political 
strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans today pushed through a $792  
billion tax cut package that sets up a clear ideological showdown 
with the White House over how best to make use of projected 
government budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said the  
Senate Finance Committee chairman, William Roth, R-Del., author of 
the 10-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said he would veto any measure that  
closely resembles the Senate bill or a similar House measure 
because the tax cuts are too large and endanger the nation's 
economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43.  
</P>
<P>
	More than one-third of the cut in the Senate bill would go to  
reducing the 15 percent bracket to 14 percent in 2001. That bracket 
would be expanded in 2005 to apply to taxable income of up to 
$47,050 on joint returns and $27,750 for single taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow married couples to file single returns on a combined form  
starting in 2005 as a way to deal with the so-called marriage 
penalty under which some couples pay more than they would if 
single. In 2001, the bill also would increase the standard 
deduction for married couples to $8,600. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Beginning in 2001, phase out inheritance tax rates that are in  
excess of 50 percent and increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raise the annual contribution limits to retirement accounts to  
$5,000 from the current $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the House plan, which also totals $792  
billion, is a 10 percent across-the-board cut in tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., met with 
their top deputies to discuss the timetable for negotiations to 
resolve differences between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the goal was to get the bill through the House and  
Senate by the end of next week, although it will probably be 
September, after the congressional August recess, before it is 
presented to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has stated repeatedly that he will veto the GOP plans on  
grounds they are too big, would take away money from needed 
spending for Social Security and other domestic programs and risk 
the nation's future economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected numerous attempts to amend the bill today,  
but accepted a proposal by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and 
other GOP conservatives that would speed up measures to reduce tax 
disadvantages for married couples. Other tax breaks in the bill 
would be delayed to offset the $6 billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill faced a  
certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said the 
``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the dark 
old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth promised action on the prescription drug issue in the fall,  
but ``we should not be pressured into simply accepting something 
that does require our most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 1, Fire 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Simon Elliott's goal just before halftime  
Saturday lifted the Los Angeles Galaxy to a 1-0 MLS victory over 
the Chicago Fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's 20-foot boot sailed over the head of Fire goaltender  
Zach Thornton and into the net with 3:24 left in the first half. 
Clint Mathias and Mauricio Cienfuegos assisted on the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire had chances to tie the game in the second half but most  
of their shots missed by several yards. Los Angeles goaltender 
Kevin Hartman, who leads the league with seven shutouts this 
season, was forced to make a spectacular save on a shot from Josh 
Wolff in the 77th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Galaxy (12-8, 30 points) moved into second place ahead of  
Chicago (10-9, 28) in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the Galaxy's third game in seven days but it was the Fire  
who came out flat. They were outshot 8-3 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily for the players, temperatures cooled from a high of 102  
degrees on Friday to the relatively comfortable 80s Saturday in 
Soldier Field at the city's downtown lakefront. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fire entered the game 4-1 at home against Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Judge Keeps Hospital Restraint Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A challenge by hospitals and mental health  
care providers to new proposed federal regulations on the use of 
restraints in hospitals was dismissed Friday by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, which were announced in June by the Health Care  
Financing Administration, prohibit the use of restraints and 
seclusion as a means for coercion, discipline, convenience or 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems and the  
American Hospital Association contested a provision requiring a 
physician or licensed practitioner to meet face-to-face with and 
evaluate the patient within one hour of being placed in seclusion 
or restraints. 
</P>
<P>
	The two groups sought a temporary injunction against enforcement  
of the provision, saying that it was a major change in practice and 
merited further discussion. They proposed a substitute that would 
have allowed the doctor to consult with the patient's nurse within 
an hour and determine whether to come in immediately or give orders 
over the phone and come in at a later point. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Gladys Kessler dismissed their motion  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Covall, executive director of the National Association of  
Psychiatric Health Systems, said the group supports the overall 
regulations, but feared that provision would cause substanital 
hardship to physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the groups will continue to work with the administration  
on the regulations, which are to go into effect in late August.

<HEADLINE> Crane Collapse Cause Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Two companies involved in the construction of  
Miller Park have come to two different conclusions as to what 
caused the fatal crane collapse at the partially-built ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of America, which is building the  
stadium's retractable roof, is implicating the 567-foot crane. 
There seems to have been a critical failure as it lifted a 400-ton 
roof piece July 14, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything seems to point to structural failure, said Patrick  
Knight, Mitsubishi's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, I think weather is going to be shown to be a  
zero factor in this whole thing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But crane owner and operator, Neil F. Lampson Inc., blames the  
lift that killed three ironworkers on high winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think that, quite frankly ... that it was an act of  
God that that wind came up and gusted the way it did,'' Lampson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lampson also blamed the accident on inaccurate estimates of  
how far the gusts would cause the piece of roof being hauled by the 
crane to sway in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody involved with that lift underestimated the  
sail area on that load and how much effect those gusting winds were 
going to have on it,'' Lampson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nobody's fault. It was just underestimated, and nobody  
knows what the speed of the wind gusts were at the top of that 
building,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no evidence that the crane malfunctioned, said Don  
Carlson, Lampson's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies agree that even when the lift was underway, no  
one at the site spoke out against continuing in the face of high 
winds. 
</P>
<P>
	The local ironworkers union will wait until the Milwaukee County  
District Attorney's office determines the cause of the crash before 
coming out with its version of the fatal lift, said Brent Emons, 
business manager for Iron Workers Local 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, sorting out responsibility for the accident that  
killed three ironworkers is moving from the ballpark to law offices 
and courtrooms.

<HEADLINE> Partners To Get Airline Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- United Airlines agreed to extend some  
benefits to domestic partners, just hours after an appeals court 
refused to grant the company an exemption to a city ordinance 
mandating the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect June 1, 1997, requires companies  
doing business with San Francisco to offer the same benefits to 
domestic partners as they do to married spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken directed airlines to  
comply with portions of the law for their employees in San 
Francisco. But she also ruled that the airlines did not have to 
compy with the ordinance's pension and health benefits 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines appealed and asked for a temporary exemption from  
the law while the appellate court reviewed the case. Friday's 
ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the 
temporary exemption. However, the appeal over the merits of the 
original case is still ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling means the carriers, represented by the Air Transport  
Association of America, must begin Monday to offer bereavement 
leave, family medical leave and spousal flight discounts to San 
Francisco domestic partners. 
</P>
<P>
	United said it will begin offering family benefits to  
non-married families nationwide next May. The company has 20,000 
employees in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted that United Airlines chose to do the right  
thing, even if we had to force them to do it,'' said Jeff Sheehy, a 
spokesman for the city's Equal Benefits Advocates, which had 
organized a boycott of United. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have said from the very outset, this case has never been  
about gay and lesbian rights,'' said United Chairman James Goodwin. 
``What we oppose -- and what we will continue to oppose -- are local 
municipalities intruding upon the federal domain by attempting to 
legislate the employee benefits package of companies like airlines 
doing business nationwide.''

<HEADLINE> Martha Stewart Co. Files for IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You can buy Martha Stewart books, magazines or  
home products. And soon, you'll be able to buy stock in her 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, the ubiquitous queen of better homemaking, cooking and  
gardening, is planning to raise some $100 million in an initial 
public offering of shares in her company, Martha Stewart Living 
Omnimedia Inc., according to documents filed Thursday with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart would retain control of the company, which had $180  
million in revenue and a net profit of $23.8 million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's centerpiece business is the monthly magazine  
Martha Stewart Living, but its television merchandising and 
Internet businesses have experienced strong growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it may use $42 million of the proceeds to buy  
out the remaining 6.2 percent stake held by Time Warner, an initial 
backer of Stewart's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the documents say a 5 percent stake in the company will be  
sold for $25 million to Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Buyers, a 
venture capital firm in San Francisco. The firm will also have the 
right to 15 percent of any publicly traded class of stock issued in 
an Internet business for an additional $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company expects to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Rapper ODB Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Russell Jones, also known as rapper ODB, was  
arrested early Saturday in Queens, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police stopped Jones, 30, on Linden Boulevard at about 2:45 a.m.  
after he allegedly ran a red light in his 1994 Mercedes 
convertible. Officers arrested Jones when they learned he was 
driving with a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled  
substance and unlawful possession of marijuana after a search of 
his car allegedly turned up several bags believed to contain crack 
cocaine and marijuana, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, who is part of the Wu-Tang Clan, was arrested March 26 in  
New York for driving with a suspended license. Earlier that week he 
had been arrested on misdemeanor drug charges when police allegedly 
found a small amount of crack cocaine after a traffic stop.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Gets Another Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- What the Women's World Cup started in  
the United States, those at the Pan American Games hope to push a 
little more down the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than three weeks after the second Women's Football  
Symposium in Los Angeles finished with a call for more women's 
age-limited tournaments -- and specifically a world championship -- 
five under-20 national teams have gathered in Winnipeg to compete 
for only the second confederation-sanctioned youth crown offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very positive to have this competition immediately after  
the World Cup,'' said Mexican coach Leonardo Cuellar, who also 
coached Mexico's women's team at USA '99 and brought five members 
of that squad to Winnipeg. ``The TV is here. This is being shown in 
Mexico. It is giving exposure to what needs to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Pan Ams starting only 13 days after the Women's World  
Cup final, CONCACAF, which was given virtual control of the event, 
decided to make it an under-20 competition. 
</P>
<P>
	That limited the number of countries participating because most  
nations barely field a senior national team, let alone an underage 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	On top of that, the United States sent essentially its under-18  
team because of its commitment to the Nordic Cup, an annual 
invitational that for a little less than a decade has stood as a de 
facto youth championship. 
</P>
<P>
	That eight-team event is set for Iceland on Aug. 2-8.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's obvious to the rest of the world that we're being  
very aggressive in an area of the game that needs promotion,'' 
CONCACAF deputy general secretary Ted Howard said. ``We also know 
we need to promote it in our member nations where it may not be the 
most accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only last week, CONCACAF joined Asia, Africa, Europe and South  
America in announcing that next year it will stage a continental 
championship for women. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pan Ams is only the second non-exhibition title for  
girls, following in the path of last year's European under-18 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's clear those associated with the women's programs are  
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tremendous for our younger players,'' said Canada  
coach Neil Turnbull, who like Cuellar coached his country's senior 
team at the Women's World Cup. ``One thing we lack is World 
Cup-level experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to bring a new girl into the national team, her  
first cap might be against the United States -- the best team in the 
world. Her second might be against China. (The Pan Ams) is 
international soccer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles two days before the World Cup final, Per Ravn  
Omdal of Norway, chairman of FIFA's Committee for Women's Football, 
said the creation of more women's championships, and specifically 
youth events, would spur confederations and national associations 
into creating and supporting women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is also the concern youth tournaments will widen the  
gap between the haves and have nots of women's soccer. The belief 
is that already developed powers will further improve, while others 
will become discouraged from getting pounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly at the Pan Ams, the United States, Canada and Mexico are  
in one tier, with Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago in another. 
</P>
<P>
	In four games, the Americans and Canadians routed Costa Rica and  
Trinidad by a combined score of 25-2. The scores were similar to 
some seen during World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talent pool (at the youth level), despite gains, is not  
that big,'' 1999 Women's World Cup spokesman Aaron Heifetz said 
from his office in Los Angeles. ``It's much tougher for developing 
nations to put together teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, even for those that get pummeled, some see positives.  
</P>
<P>
	``It all depends on what you do with it, how you view it,'' said  
U.S. coach Jay Hoffman, who also used to coach the U.S. men's 
under-20 team. ``It depends on what you do as a follow-up. If 
somebody just brought a team here, but doesn't do anything until a 
year from now ... 
</P>
<P>
	``If you bring a team in here, and next month you do a little  
more, and then a little more ... I assume all countries here are 
attempting to improve. If that's the case, it will only help sport, 
only help the confederation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- American boxers, tennis and softball  
players were very stingy Saturday at the Pan American Games. The 
women's basketball team was anything but. 
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Gerald Tucker and light heavyweight Joe Pastorello  
easily moved into the second round with lopsided victories. And the 
women's world champions in softball got their third straight 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody was more dominating than 18-year-old tennis phenom  
Alexandra Stevenson, who routed Francine Harvey of Antiqua 6-0, 
6-0. It was her first double shutout since she was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, the first woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals as a  
qualifier, has lost two games in four sets. She has spent as much 
time concentrating on collecting pins as on her groundstrokes and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly looking for pins from other countries,'' said  
Stevenson, whose opponent asked for her autograph after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman in action was Lilia Osterloh, who defeated  
Joelle Schad of the Dominican Republic 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Mamiitt beat Simon Ebelyn of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 6-3, 6-4  
and Bob Bryan was a 6-1, 6-1 winner of Felix Insaurralde of 
Paraguay in men's play. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of those strong victories came a weak performance  
from the women's basketball squad, which sustained its worst Pan 
Ams loss ever, 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban women overwhelmed the United States with quickness,  
slashing drives to the basket and a trapping zone defense. They 
jumped to a 14-3 lead in the first five minutes and the Americans 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good, but we know we're a lot better defensive team  
than that,'' forward Lynn Pride said. ``We had a lot of breakdowns. 
We usually rely on our help, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, the U.S. baseball team played Panama in the  
quarterfinals. Earlier, Canada and Cuba both advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's basketball squads also played their second  
games of the preliminary round Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's softball team beat the Netherlands Antilles 7-0  
behind the three-hit pitching of Lori Harrigan. In the three games, 
the Americans have outscored their opponents 21-0, allowing only 
four hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a left-hander, walked only one and struck out nine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime your pitchers go out and don't allow any runs, you  
have to be happy with their performance,'' coach Ralph Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Douty led an 11-hit U.S. attack with two hits and two  
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, romped to a 24-4 win over Cesar Morales  
of Mexico. Pastorello of Colorado Springs, Colo., was an 11-2 
winner against Francisco Garcia of the Dominican. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker forced a standing-8 count in the first round and then  
eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many butterflies before this bout, and then to top  
things off I was the first bout,'' he said. ``I just felt I had to 
continue what was started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won their first two bouts on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two baseball games in pool play amid  
rumors of impending defections, beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 as 
Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala 12-2 in a game stopped by 
the 10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the 
Canadians scored four runs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Readies for Vote on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican bill to cut taxes by $792  
billion, after dodging numerous attempts to alter or shrink it, 
headed today for passage in the Senate and the larger obstacle of a 
promised presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert and top GOP tax writers met to discuss 
strategy over what could be a prolonged battle with the White House 
over the final size and shape of the tax cut. First, the House and 
Senate also have to resolve differences in their two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said they hope to reach a deal with the House and finish  
voting by the end of next week, when Congress leaves for its August 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP majority was expected to give solid backing to the  
10-year plan that would reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 
percent, ease the so-called marriage penalty, reduce estate taxes 
and increase IRA contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	First though, they accepted, 98-2, an amendment by Sen. Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and other GOP conservatives that would 
speed up measures to reduce tax disadvantages for married couples. 
Other tax breaks in the bill would be delayed to offset the $6 
billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	With passage, GOP leaders intended to move quickly to resolve  
differences with a House-passed bill that would reach the same $792 
billion level of tax relief through different kinds of cuts. The 
bill, however, was not expected to be sent to the president until 
September, giving both supporters and opponents a chance to press 
their case during the August recess. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill  
faced a certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said 
the ``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the 
dark old days of huge deficits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., promised action  
on the prescription drug issue in the fall, but ``we should not be 
pressured into simply accepting something that does require our 
most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Reduce the 15 percent tax bracket to 14 percent and increase  
the number of people eligible for that tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide relief to married couples who are pushed into a higher  
tax bracket because of their combined incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase allowable contributions to retirement funds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Provide deductions for health insurance costs and long-term  
care. 
</P>
<P>
	--Increase the eligible income limits for student loan interest  
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Repeal estate tax rates in excess of 50 percent and, in 2007,  
increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 1429.

<HEADLINE> Two-Sport Star Returns to Football </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Drew Henson's summer job is over and now he's  
heading back to school. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-sport star wrapped up the baseball portion of his year  
Saturday and will return to college football after an impressive 
stay with the New York Yankees' Class A team in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being exposed to this level of pitching has been beyond  
anything I've seen before,'' said Henson, who entered Saturday's 
game hitting .271 with 36 RBIs and a team-best 13 home runs in 67 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson, a sophomore, will now turn his attention to playing  
quarterback at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having success, especially playing at a level higher than I  
thought I would be at, definitely goes a long way as far as my 
confidence,'' Henson said. ``I had to deal with my first major 
slump of my baseball career and learning once you're in one how to 
get out. It will carry over to football. If I'm struggling, I'll 
know I got through it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Original plans had Henson, who made his pro baseball debut  
during a 10-game stint in the rookie Gulf Coast League in 1998 -- 
playing this season at the Yankees low level Class A team in 
Greensboro. After hitting higher than .300 during his stay in the 
extended spring training program, team officials decided to send 
Henson to the high-level Class A Florida State League. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees haven't talked with Henson yet about where he will  
play next season, but he has higher aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I imagine they will bring me back here and do the same type of  
schedule as this year,'' Henson said. ``At some point, I'd like to 
get up to Double-A next year, whether it is June or July, just to 
get at-bats and experience.''

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- American boxers, tennis and softball  
players were very stingy Saturday at the Pan American Games. The 
women's basketball team was anything but. 
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Gerald Tucker and light heavyweight Joe Pastorello  
easily moved into the second round with lopsided victories. And the 
women's world champions in softball got their third straight 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody was more dominating than 18-year-old tennis phenom  
Alexandra Stevenson, who routed Francine Harvey of Antiqua 6-0, 
6-0. It was her first double shutout since she was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, the first woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals as a  
qualifier, has lost two games in four sets. She has spent as much 
time concentrating on collecting pins as on her groundstrokes and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly looking for pins from other countries,'' said  
Stevenson, whose opponent asked for her autograph after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman in action was Lilia Osterloh, who defeated  
Joelle Schad of the Dominican Republic 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Mamiitt beat Simon Ebelyn of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 6-3, 6-4  
and Bob Bryan was a 6-1, 6-1 winner of Felix Insaurralde of 
Paraguay in men's play. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of those strong victories came a weak performance  
from the women's basketball squad, which sustained its worst Pan 
Ams loss ever, 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban women overwhelmed the United States with quickness,  
slashing drives to the basket and a trapping zone defense. They 
jumped to a 14-3 lead in the first five minutes and the Americans 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good, but we know we're a lot better defensive team  
than that,'' forward Lynn Pride said. ``We had a lot of breakdowns. 
We usually rely on our help, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, the U.S. baseball team played Panama in the  
quarterfinals. Earlier, Canada and Cuba both advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's basketball squads also played their second  
games of the preliminary round Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's softball team beat the Netherlands Antilles 7-0  
behind the three-hit pitching of Lori Harrigan. In the three games, 
the Americans have outscored their opponents 21-0, allowing only 
four hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a left-hander, walked only one and struck out nine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime your pitchers go out and don't allow any runs, you  
have to be happy with their performance,'' coach Ralph Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Douty led an 11-hit U.S. attack with two hits and two  
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, romped to a 24-4 win over Cesar Morales  
of Mexico. Pastorello of Colorado Springs, Colo., was an 11-2 
winner against Francisco Garcia of the Dominican. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker forced a standing-8 count in the first round and then  
eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many butterflies before this bout, and then to top  
things off I was the first bout,'' he said. ``I just felt I had to 
continue what was started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won their first two bouts on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two baseball games in pool play amid  
rumors of impending defections, beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 as 
Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala 12-2 in a game stopped by 
the 10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the 
Canadians scored four runs.

<HEADLINE> Mets Get Taylor for Isringhausen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets bolstered the strongest part  
of their team Saturday, acquiring closer Billy Taylor from the 
Oakland Athletics for right-handers Jason Isringhausen and Greg 
McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 37, was fourth in the AL with 26 saves, but will likely  
join Turk Wendell and Dennis Cook as set-up men for Armando Benitez 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets bullpen has been the second stingiest in the majors  
this season and is a major reason why the team was only a half-game 
behind Atlanta in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relievers have been overtaxed all season, especially  
since closer John Franco was sidelined four weeks ago with a 
partially torn tendon on the middle finger of his left hand. Franco 
is expected to miss about one more month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have gone 126 games without a complete game -- 14 short  
of the major league record held by Anaheim -- and Mets relievers are 
averaging more than 3.2 innings per game. Wendell leads the league 
with 55 appearances, followed by Benitez (53) and Cook (50). 
</P>
<P>
	New York also acquired left-hander Chuck McElroy in a  
five-player deal from Colorado hours before the trading deadline. 
The Mets sent outfielder Brian McRae, reliever Rigo Beltran and 
minor league outfielder Thomas Johnson to the Rockies for McElroy 
and outfielder Darryl Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, once one of the Mets brightest pitching prospects,  
has been hampered by injuries throughout his career and was sent to 
the bullpen earlier this year. He is 1-3 with a 6.41 ERA this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love Isringhausen's arm, period,'' A's general manager  
Billy Beane said. ``We have to find some power arms in the bullpen. 
He can throw 95-97 MPH and it's hard to find that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, 26, went 9-2 with a 2.81 ERA as a rookie in 1995.  
Along with Paul Wilson and Bill Pulsipher, Isringhausen was 
supposed to anchor the Mets' pitching staff for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, all three have been beset by injury and  
ineffectiveness. Wilson underwent reconstructive surgery on his 
right elbow in March, and Pulsipher was traded to Milwaukee last 
season after reconstructive surgery of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen's once-promising career has been slowed by a  
succession of injuries including a broken wrist in 1997, 
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder and elbow in 1996, and 
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow last season. He also 
battled through a 1997 bout with tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	McMichael was 1-1 with a 4.82 ERA in 19 appearances this year.  
</P>
<P>
	This is the second major deal between the two teams in the last  
eight days. On July 23, Oakland sent their ace Kenny Rogers to New 
York for two minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics also acquired Kevin Appier from the Royals for  
pitchers Blake Stein, Jeff D'Amico and Brad Rigby.

<HEADLINE>  $54 Million McNabb Misses Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Donovan McNabb spent his first day as the  
highest-paid player in Philadelphia Eagles history in much the same 
fashion as the previous week or so. 
</P>
<P>
	No helmet. No pads. No football.  
</P>
<P>
	More waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's seven-year, $54 million contract was so long and  
complicated that by the time the NFL let him sign it, it was too 
late to join his new team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb finally put his signature on the 32-page contract  
Saturday afternoon, but not until his teammates had finished two 
grueling workouts in near 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like the discordant boos he received on draft day and the  
controversial holdout that followed, it wasn't the kind of debut 
McNabb had envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan will perform so well that looking back on this moment  
today, in 100 degrees here, 15 years from now we can count the 
number of Super Bowls we've won together,'' Eagles owner Jeffrey 
Lurie said. ``Not the number of days held out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's journey from No. 2 draft pick to official pro football  
player has been a strange one, for sure, especially in the past 72 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the first several days of workouts due to a  
contract squabble, McNabb then looked on helplessly as his agent 
lit a firecracker of controversy under the talks with an assertion 
that race was playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat in a plane at the Atlanta airport for three hours while  
trying to get to Philadelphia, then arrived at Veterans Stadium 
after midnight. McNabb and his teammates had every reason to 
believe he'd be doing what he does best -- throwing a football -- a 
few hours later at Lehigh University. 
</P>
<P>
	But McNabb was excused from the morning workout, staying at his  
Cherry Hill, N.J., home until mid-morning while several teammates 
were knocked out of practice with heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there was little time for McNabb to have a physical,  
and there were plenty of details to work out with the league. Joe 
Banner, the Eagles' executive vice president, said NFL lawyers 
required some language in the contract reworded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Donovan is not allowed to sign the contract until it's all OK,  
and he is not allowed to practice until he signs the contract,'' 
Banner said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb showed up for an afternoon news conference toting a  
playbook under his arm. He's going to need it. Starting quarterback 
Doug Pederson already knows coach Andy Reid's offense, and he's 
been practicing while McNabb has been sitting idle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception is that because he's the No. 1 pick and a high  
pick, his talent is going to allow him to walk in and play 
immediately,'' offensive coordinator Rod Dowhower said. ``Reality 
is, Doug knows this offense. Doug knows how to execute this 
offense. The rest of the offensive players need to catch up with 
Doug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, seated next to Lurie, didn't blink when the owner called  
him ``a potential franchise quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, it's over, and I can participate with the rest of the  
team,'' McNabb said. ``I don't put any pressure on myself that's 
not needed. Ever since I was a member of the Syracuse Orangemen, I 
had the label as being `The Man' as you may call it. That didn't 
bother me at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb didn't seem concerned about the time he's missed, calling  
his first NFL training camp ``more of a touch-up, a deal that all 
quarterbacks need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not what Dowhower or Reid would want to hear.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only way to learn is to do,'' Dowhower said. ``That goes  
for everybody. ... This is professional football. There's a certain 
reality to it. If you want to make a lot of money, you've got to be 
the starter, at some point. Sometimes, you walk into a lot of money 
and you're not the starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New details emerged Saturday about McNabb's contract and how it  
compares with deals given to other top quarterbacks like Tim Couch, 
the No. 1 pick this year, and Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, the top 
two picks in last year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb got an $11.3 million signing bonus, but the deal does not  
include the voidable years or buy-back clause for which Smith had 
pushed. That means McNabb cannot earn a second signing bonus, and 
it could hinder agent Leigh Steinberg's attempt to get that kind of 
deal for No. 3 pick Akili Smith of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	A highly placed NFL source who has seen McNabb's contract said  
it could be worth $53.7 million if he achieves all the bonuses and 
so-called escalator clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said McNabb  
would earn significant bonus money if he's in the top eight in the 
league in any of 4-5 passing categories in any of the first four 
years. The bonuses are higher if he's in the top five, and even 
higher if he's in the top three in any category during any season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some bonus money also is tied to making the playoffs or Pro  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Escalated salaries in years 5-7 of the contract would kick in if  
McNabb achieves certain passing statistics that are very attainable 
if he simply gets playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who is also familiar with the contracts signed by  
Couch, Manning and Leaf, said McNabb ranked behind Couch in total 
value and ahead of Manning and Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	If he achieves all the incentives in his contract, Couch could  
earn as much as $59.4 million for seven years, the source said. 
Manning could make $48 million for six years and Leaf could get a 
little more than $31 million for five years by achieving all the 
incentives.

<HEADLINE> Milton Berle Sues Over Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Milton Berle has sued a real estate company  
and a gay publication over an advertisement that depicts him in 
drag and implies the 91-year-old entertainer is homosexual, Berle's 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Century 21 advertisement features an old photo of Berle  
wearing a dress while doing a parody of singer Carmen Miranda in a 
television comedy sketch, Berle's attorney, David Albert Pierce, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisement appeared in the spring-summer 1998 edition of  
Lambda's Out!, a resource guide for the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
	The caption of the ad read: ``Our team of friendly professionals  
know how to cater to royalty ... after all, every queen deserves a 
castle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply concerned that a generation of Americans  
unfamiliar with Berle's classic schtick are seeing Berle depicted 
as a homosexual within the pages of this gay magazine,'' Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The comedian is seeking $6 million in damages from Century 21  
Real Estate Corp. and Lambda Publications Inc. for defamation of 
character and unauthorized use of his image, according to the 
lawsuit filed June 4 in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone calls to Lambda Publications and Century 21 were not  
returned.

the No. 1 pick this year, and Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf, the top 
two picks in last year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb got an $11.3 million signing bonus, but the deal does not  
include the voidable years or buy-back clause for which Smith had 
pushed. That means McNabb cannot earn a second signing bonus, and 
it could hinder agent Leigh Steinberg's attempt to get that kind of 
deal for No. 3 pick Akili Smith of Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	A highly placed NFL source who has seen McNabb's contract said  
it could be worth $53.7 million if he achieves all the bonuses and 
so-called escalator clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said McNabb  
would earn significant bonus money if he's in the top eight in the 
league in any of 4-5 passing categories in any of the first four 
years. The bonuses are higher if he's in the top five, and even 
higher if he's in the top three in any category during any season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some bonus money also is tied to making the playoffs or Pro  
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Escalated salaries in years 5-7 of the contract would kick in if  
McNabb achieves certain passing statistics that are very attainable 
if he simply gets playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who is also familiar with the contracts signed by  
Couch, Manning and Leaf, said McNabb ranked behind Couch in total 
value and ahead of Manning and Leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	If he achieves all the incentives in his contract, Couch could  
earn as much as $59.4 million for seven years, the source said. 
Manning could make $48 million for six years and Leaf could get a 
little more than $31 million for five years by achieving all the 
incentives.

<HEADLINE> Another Shakeup for the 49ers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKTON (AP) -- The San Francisco 49ers training camp was just  
under way last year when Carmen Policy suddenly resigned as 
president, triggering a volatile and drawn-out front-office 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, less than a week into this training camp, the club was hit  
with an ownership shakeup. As part of a deal resolving a feud over 
more than $1 billion in family assets, suspended owner Eddie 
DeBartolo gave up his stake in the team and his estranged sister, 
Denise DeBartolo York, and her husband, John York, assumed full 
ownership and control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next year at this time, I'm not coming,'' coach Steve Mariucci  
quipped Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a perfect world, you'd like to have some stability and  
continuity and comfort and some routine within your job, like 
anybody would. But it simply hasn't been that way. Certainly we 
would never make it an excuse for us to fail, so we simply just 
keep on trucking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	York delivered a similar message to the club in brief  
conversations with players, coaches and administrators during 
Saturday's training camp practice and later in an address to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure what an owner does right now other than to make  
sure you've got the right leaders in place and the right coaches 
and that they have the right equipment and right tools to make sure 
everything runs so that you can win,'' York said. 
</P>
<P>
	York declined to comment on the deal reached Friday splitting  
the assets of the DeBartolo family's financial empire, saying he 
was under court orders not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the pact, which could be weeks or months away  
from final approval, DeBartolo gave up his half of the team. He 
also acknowledged owing $94 million to the family corporation and 
received properties and stock worth tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, once finalized, would settle the siblings' dueling  
lawsuits over control of the family's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	It also ends a 22-year association with the club by Eddie  
DeBartolo, whose free-spending run was marked by five Super Bowl 
titles and an agonizing finish. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo withdrew as chairman of the team and his sister took  
over in December 1997 when he became caught up in a gambling fraud 
probe in Louisiana. He's still serving a year-long NFL suspension 
that came soon after his guilty plea last October on a charge 
arising from the gambling probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The siblings' suits, filed in federal court in Ohio, are on hold  
while the sides put the finishing touches on their settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've known Eddie for all these years,'' quarterback Steve  
Young said. ``Now, it's time to get to know the Yorks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mariucci said the Yorks already have shown a willingness to  
spend the money needed to make necessary acquisitions of players 
and keep the team's competitive footing. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we have to comply with salary cap rules, we can still be  
very aggressive and spend every penny that you have,'' Mariucci 
said. ``We've done that. They haven't changed a thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commitment to success is unchanged but York stressed that  
the team would be run in a professional, business-like manner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how you can be part of this team and not recognize  
that the only thing you're supposed to do with this team is to 
win,'' York said. 
</P>
<P>
	York added he didn't expect any management changes and said the  
club was fortunate to have strong administrative and coaching 
staffs, led by general manager Bill Walsh and Mariucci. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great group of people here,'' said York, who will  
oversee day-to-day operations while maintaining his Youngstown, 
Ohio, residence. ``I think they're getting the players in order and 
I'm pleased with what I see. It looks great to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said they're keeping the team in San Francisco and had  
no intention of selling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no plans other than owning this team and making sure  
that they're here in San Francisco,'' York said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he hoped to get a plan for a new stadium back on  
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to make sure we have a viable stadium. We're going  
to get it worked out,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report:Jazz To Sign Malone for $67M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone won't be a free agent for  
long. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz reportedly will sign the two-time NBA Most  
Valuable Player to a four-year contract worth the maximum $67 
million under NBA salary cap rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune reported the pending contract, and Malone  
as well as Jazz owner Larry Miller confirmed for the Associated 
Press that a Sunday press conference is planned to announce 
Malone's re-signing. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's new collective bargaining agreement allows Malone to  
receive $14 million next season, plus annual 12 percent raises over 
the next three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone, voted MVP in 1997 and again this season, just completed  
a four-year deal worth $20.2 million, an amount he grumbled about 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old forward also has been an All-Star 11 times, has  
two Olympic gold medals and ranks among the league's career scoring 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone played in 49 of 50 games last season, missing one due to  
suspension. He averaged 23.8 points in 1999, his lowest since 
1986-87, his second year in the league. His rebounding average was 
down to 9.4, lowest since his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone led the Jazz to a 37-13 record last season, but it ended  
on a bitter note when Utah was eliminated in the Western Conference 
semifinals by the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the series-clinching loss, Malone finished with a career  
playoff-low eight points on 3-of-16 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz guard John Stockton, the NBA's career leader in assists and  
steals, also becomes a free agent on Sunday but is expected to 
re-sign with the team. Forward Shandon Anderson and guard Jeff 
Hornacek are the other prominent Jazz players who will become 
eligible for free agency Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Safety Interests Change Playgrounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seesaws and sandboxes are things of the past.  
Monkey bars are an endangered species. And places where kids can 
hide are too scary for grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's playground aims to be safer, cleaner and less prone to  
lawsuits than those of decades past. Critics who see 
rough-and-tumble fun as a vital part of childhood disapprove, but 
playground experts say the new equipment is reducing serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to take all the excitement out of the playground  
-- the risk-taking, the fun, the ability to succeed,'' says Fran 
Wallach, a board member for the National Program for Playground 
Safety. ``On the other hand, we want to remove all the hazards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, more than 200,000 children a year are injured  
seriously enough on playgrounds to require trips to emergency 
rooms. The most common serious injuries are broken bones, but for 
children 4 or younger, almost 60 percent of the injuries involve 
the face or brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the statistics, experts say playground safety has  
dramatically improved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compared to a generation ago, playgrounds are so much safer,''  
says Tracy Shelton, who helped survey playground safety for the New 
York Public Interest Research Group and found the city's 
playgrounds did well compared to others around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be that if you fell, you were probably going to  
break something. You were falling from a higher height and on to a 
harder surface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, thanks to rubber surfacing, a kid who loses his grip can  
fall on his shoulder and get up without so much as a bruise. 
</P>
<P>
	New York was the first U.S. city to put rubber mats under all  
equipment. It also was the first city to fence off every swing set 
to keep kids from getting kicked as they run by. You won't find 
old-fashioned rectangular monkey bars either. They've been replaced 
by boxy, colorful climbing structures with interconnected ramps, 
rungs, ladders, steps, slides and guard rails. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City is undertaking its most ambitious program of  
playground renovation since public works czar Robert Moses built 
650 outdoor play spaces around the city in the 1930s, '40s and 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandboxes are being removed because people allow their dogs to  
relieve themselves in the absorbent sand. Tunnels are out of style 
because parents get nervous when kids can't be seen. Sprinklers 
have replaced unsanitary wading pools. And seesaws are going 
because kids fall off or plunk down so hard they injure their 
spines. 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents complain the new playgrounds are boring and  
accurately blame the fear of litigation for some of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're maybe being made too sterile in the interest  
of avoiding lawsuits,'' says Michele Herman, a Manhattan mother of 
two. ``It's sad, the loss of all the seesaws. It's a shame, this 
whole generation, growing up without them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because 90 percent of lawsuits involving playground injuries are  
settled out of court and leave no paper trail, it's difficult to 
assess their impact, says Donna Thompson, head of the National 
Program for Public Safety. But city Parks Commissioner Henry Stern 
acknowledges the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We live in such an antiseptic, risk-free society,'' Stern  
says. ``You want to eliminate the obvious hazards. But you're 
dealing with children at play who are out to show they can do 
something they couldn't do last week. So you tend to get the 
blandest, least challenging playground equipment because you don't 
want some lawyer to say, 'The playground is a trap.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood, a pediatric surgeon led a  
crusade to improve playgrounds. Dr. Barbara Barlow of Harlem 
Hospital noticed a lot of kids coming in with injuries from the 
street -- hit by cars, falling on concrete -- because local 
playgrounds were full of drug addicts, homeless people and broken 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow took her findings to Stern, and he renovated every public  
playground in Harlem -- 18 since 1990. They are kept so clean 
children can go barefoot in the sprinklers without fear of broken 
glass. And after Barlow sent a photograph of a child's hand impaled 
on a spiked iron fence, Stern had every fence sheared of its 
pointed tops. 
</P>
<P>
	The public health benefits are gratifying.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our major injuries have decreased 55 percent,'' Barlow says.  
``In the past we might have seen 350 seriously injured kids in a 
year. Now we see between 120 and 150.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A follow-up study found that ``for every dollar we spent on our  
playground programs, we saved $4 in acute health care and $85 in 
lifetime health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barlow's work has grown into a national organization, the  
Injury-Free Coalition for Kids, which has helped design parks in 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing better,'' Barlow says, ``than cutting the  
ribbon and watching kids attack playgrounds.''

<HEADLINE> Chechnya Signs Border Security Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Officials from breakaway Chechnya and the  
neighboring southern Russian republic of Stavropol signed an 
agreement Saturday on stricter control over their volatile border. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord is aimed at stopping the illegal oil trade, which has  
proven lucrative for criminal groups, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A key pipeline for transporting Caspian Sea oil runs through  
Chechnya and Stavropol, and is often shut down because of damage 
caused by Chechen attackers and by people seeking to steal oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechnya's border has seen frequent skirmishes in recent weeks,  
including attacks on Russian-controlled border posts. The border 
has been closed for short periods after serious clashes, and Russia 
has carried out some pre-emptive strikes against suspected Chechen 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's agreement was signed by representatives from the  
Chechen and Stavropol interior ministries at a meeting in Nazran, 
the capital of the nearby republic of Ingushetia, ITAR-Tass said. 
The report gave few details of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have shared goals and objectives and, most importantly, a  
desire to reverse the situation that is evolving on the border,'' 
Chechen First Deputy Interior Minister Khasan Khatsiyev said after 
the signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Chechen officials were less conciliatory. Foreign Minister  
Ilyas Akhmadov on Saturday reiterated accusations that Russia is 
preparing a ``new aggression'' and threatened to take preventive 
measures such as ``putting border and customs personnel on high 
alert and using arms to curb any slight attempt by aggressors to 
resume provocation,'' the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Saturday, two civilian hostages held for months in Chechnya  
were released, according to NTV television. One was kidnapped on 
the Chechen border last November, and the other was seized in 
Nazran this spring. The report gave no details of the release. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidnappings and other violence have plagued Chechnya since its  
1994-96 independence war. Chechnya has had de facto independence 
since the war, but while Moscow has no presence or influence in the 
rebel region, it still claims Chechnya remains part of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Goes Door-to-Door in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DERRY, N.H. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley went door-to-door in  
three New Hampshire towns Saturday, joining volunteers who spent 
the past week canvassing this key primary state on behalf of his 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator said the effort was ``massive,  
early and intentional,'' a bow to the independent streak of New 
Hampshire voters. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign said more than 500 Bradley supporters from 14  
states spent seven days visiting 100,000 front doors in 31 New 
Hampshire cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
	On doorknobs they hung handbills describing Bradley's career on  
the basketball court and in the Senate, and promising that as 
president he ``will work on the big, unfinished business of 
America'' -- racial equity, health care for all, reducing poverty 
and reforming campaign finances, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters showing an interest in learning about the candidate were  
invited to have coffee Saturday morning coffee with Bradley at a 
Manchester restaurant, where a blue Bradley for President banner 
declared, ``He has made the long shot before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we're (going door-to-door) so early is to show  
respect to the voters of New Hampshire and to invite them into the 
process of running for president,'' Bradley explained. ``I'm trying 
to do this campaign in a different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory in New Hampshire's leadoff primary is critical if  
Bradley is to beat Vice President Al Gore. Bradley said the state 
is a good place to test his low-key, open-ear campaign style. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hampshire pollster Kelly Myers said ``retail politicking  
is less important than it used to be,'' even in a state known for 
its retail politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``a big canvassing effort at this point in the  
race can be very effective. You can get introduced to voters, you 
can get your platform to them in writing, and you can get your name 
recognition up. For a person like Bill Bradley, that's very 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley set the tone for his run when he selected Gina Glantz as  
his campaign manager. She specialized in grass-roots campaigns, and 
her consulting firm helped create Hands Across America, the 1986 
nationwide demonstration in support of the hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's campaign Web site includes a ``community involvement''  
section that encourages people to get involved in any of 15 ways, 
from writing to a local newspaper to rounding up votes personally 
in New Hampshire or Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bradfield logged in from Bend, Ore., and was inspired. A  
registered Republican until decided to back Bradley, he flew to New 
Hampshire last week and spent seven days walking door-to-door for 
his candidate of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sucked in by the Web site,'' he explained, adding that  
he likes Bradley's commitment to campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there were a lot of other things I could have done  
this week,'' said Susan Wilson, a Bradley activist who flew in from 
Santa Monica, Calif. ``There's not been somebody who's made me feel 
this way since Bobby Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the New Hampshire volunteers were dubbed ``brigade  
captains.'' Bradfield and others in the state's northern reaches -- 
including the tiny town of Dixville Notch, whose residents cast the 
first votes in the state's primary -- were called the ``road 
warriors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers said they were encouraged about Bradley's chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``We encountered an awful lot of uncommitted people,'' said Mike  
Dowling of Ocean Grove, N.J., who went door-to-door in Londonderry.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Sign Cuban Outfielder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Cuban outfielder Josue Perez, whose contract with  
Los Angeles was voided by the commissioner's office June 25, signed 
with the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez agreed to a one-year, $850,000 contract that includes an  
invitation to the Phillies major-league camp next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez and another Cuban, first baseman Juan Carlos Diaz, were  
declared free agents June 25 after the commissioner's office ruled 
the Dodgers violated rules barring scouting in Cuba and engineering 
defections. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a continuing effort to broaden our scouting, we felt it was  
important to get into the Cuban market,'' Phillies general manager 
Ed Wade said. ``This fits into that frame of thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 21, was playing with Vero Beach in the Class A Florida  
State League when his contract with the Dodgers was voided. In 62 
games there, he hit .279 with two homers, 22 RBIs and 14 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	After signing with the Dodgers prior to the 1998 season, Perez  
played in the Dominican Summer League, where he hit .335 with eight 
doubles, seven triples, two homers, 17 RBIs and 24 steals in 167 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perez is a true center-fielder with excellent speed,'' said  
Mike Arbuckle, the Phillies scouting director. ``On offense, he's a 
switch-hitter that is good from both sides of the plate. We see him 
as a base stealer with a chance to make things happen.''

<HEADLINE> Police Across Street During Spree </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Nothing in the second building where Mark Barton  
opened fire was going to stop him from killing. Not the unmonitored 
video cameras, not the unarmed security guard, and especially not 
the police across the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides trying to understand why Barton killed his family and  
then nine people at two Atlanta brokerages, authorities spent 
Friday assessing how Barton traversed one of the city's busiest 
thoroughfares unimpeded to continue his rampage. He then fled, 
spurring a five-hour manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how he got away,'' said Atlanta Police Chief  
Beverly Harvard. ``We did everything exactly as it should have been 
done, and the officers did an excellent job, especially when it 
came to response time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's first stop was Securities Centre, which houses Momentum  
Securities, a day-trading firm where the 44-year-old had traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Barton was a regular client, and one of those people who  
would have never been stopped,'' said Magnes Welsh, spokeswoman for 
Jones Lang Lasalle, the Chicago firm that manages Security Centre. 
``There was nothing unusual about his arrival at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-story building features unarmed guards at the  
entrance, while customers and employees come and go at will during 
regular office hours. The same is true at Barton's second stop, 
Perimeter Center, another seven-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Harvard said Barton loitered at Securities Centre for about  
30 minutes before drawing his guns. She said witnesses recalled him 
saying ``It's a bad trading day, and it's going to get worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four died after Barton opened fire. He then crossed Piedmont  
Avenue, one of Atlanta's main north-south arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum Securities is on the third floor, but other workers in  
the building weren't surprised he was able to get out so quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are four elevators and they come pretty quick,'' said  
Beth Lavender, a client service specialist for Financial 
Development Corp., a floor below the shooting. ``And there are two 
doors in and out, so he probably was able to get out fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Piedmont Center, Barton opened fire again, killing five more  
at All-Tech Investment Group -- another day-trading firm where 
Barton had been a client. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities responded to the first call within four minutes, but  
then a backup officer heard shots across the street. By the time he 
arrived, Barton was gone. 
</P>
<P>
	But police, thinking he was still inside, began a painstaking  
search of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to remember that it was the end of the business  
day,'' Ms. Harvard said. ``And we are talking about Piedmont 
Avenue, one of the busiest streets of the city. There were a lot of 
people coming and going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how Barton carried his two handguns, a 9 mm Glock  
and a Colt .45, as he walked around Buckhead -- an upscale district 
north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other guns -- a .25 caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol and a  
.22 caliber Harrington &AMP; Richardson revolver -- later were found 
along with a duffel bag filled with 200 rounds of .45 ammunition 
and two pairs of handcuffs in Barton's minivan. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton purchased the Glock at a store in Warner Robins in 1993  
and the H&AMP;R revolver at a pawn shop in South Carolina in 1976, said 
a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	The .45, with which Barton later committed suicide, was  
purchased by a gun dealer in Texas in 1983, but it was unclear how 
Barton got it. And the Raven was bought at an unspecified Georgia 
pawn shop in 1992, but not by Barton. The identity of the previous 
owner was not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Barton's Wife Had Safety Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Mass killer Mark O. Barton's first victim in a  
murderous rampage last week -- his wife, Leigh Ann -- had been 
worried for her safety but loved Barton's children and wanted to 
continue to be involved in their lives, her sister said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry it happened to my sister but I'm not surprised,''  
said Dana Reeves, Leigh Ann Barton's older sister. ``I've felt that 
this has been coming for a couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Barton killed his 27-year-old wife with a hammer Tuesday,  
it was the beginning of the bloodiest mass killing in Atlanta's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	The next night he killed his two children from a previous  
marriage as they slept in the family's suburban apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings were discovered Thursday when Barton, a chemist  
turned day stock-trader, walked into the offices of two brokerage 
firms and fired randomly at traders and employees. Nine died and 13 
were wounded, with four still in critical condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, Barton killed himself as police pulled over his  
van. 
</P>
<P>
	The first funeral was Friday for Allen Charles Tenenbaum, a  
48-year-old father of three. The grocer was gunned down while 
trading at All-Tech Investment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean Mohammed Delawalla, 52, of Atlanta was buried Saturday  
after a one-hour, 15-minute Islamic service at a funeral home in 
suburban Lilburn. A spokeswoman for the family, Zeenat Hussain, 
estimated that 2,000 attended the service, much of which took place 
on the asphalt parking lot with the media looking on from a nearby 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dean was a very devoted member of this community,'' Ms.  
Hussain said. 
</P>
<P>
	A private memorial service was held in Buckhead for family  
members of the victims. Afterwards, relatives of one of the dead, 
Edward Quinn, walked solemnly down Piedmont Road to the building 
where he was killed. There, they said prayers and placed flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Services for Mrs. Barton were scheduled for Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves, who lives in Macon, said her sister left Barton in  
October, in part because she was frustrated after supporting her 
jobless husband for about a year. She worked as a sales 
representative for a company that sells cleaning supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves said she was wary of Barton after learning that his  
first wife and her mother had been hacked to death in Alabama in 
1993. Barton was the prime suspect in the slayings, but police said 
they never had enough evidence to charge him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never really a comfortable feeling with him after  
that,'' Ms. Reeves said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton was having an affair with then-Leigh Ann Vandiver at the  
time of the Alabama slayings. If Barton killed his first wife, Ms. 
Reeves said, her sister knew nothing of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just an innocent victim that something terrible has  
happened to,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found Mrs. Barton's body covered with a blanket in a  
bedroom closet of the apartment. In a computer-printed suicide note 
Barton left for police, he said he was sorry for his wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main reasons for  
my demise as I planned to kill the others,'' Barton wrote. ``I 
really wish I hadn't killed her now. She really couldn't help it 
and I love her so much anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves said her sister would talk of fights with Barton, but  
would never answer directly when asked if he abused her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she had fears from him,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last deep-down, heart-to-heart conversation we had, I  
asked her was she comfortable or scared. She said, `Yes, but my 
apartment has this security system and that makes me feel 
comfortable.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple separated in October but Mrs. Barton allowed her  
husband to move into her apartment a few weeks ago, her sister 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Reeves said she thinks her sister tried to reconcile with  
Barton because she missed his children -- Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 
7. She said Mrs. Barton treated the children as if they were her 
own, coaching Matthew's soccer team and leading Mychelle's Brownie 
troop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know she had some concerns about the kids, wanting to be  
with them and wanting to be involved in their life like she had 
been,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten shooting victims remained hospitalized after one woman was  
discharged Saturday from Grady Memorial Hospital. Four were in 
critical condition, including a 38-year-old woman shot in the 
temple and who may be blinded permanently.

<HEADLINE> Examples of Assigned Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	In the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals, chief judges at the  
federal courthouse in Washington made special assignments of 
important cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John Sirica, a Republican appointee of President  
Eisenhower, assigned himself two cases stemming from the Watergate 
break-in and the subsequent cover-up by President Nixon's top 
aides. The trials resulted in guilty verdicts for all but one 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Iran-Contra affair, chief judge Aubrey Robinson assigned  
important cases to two of the most experienced judges at the 
courthouse, Gerhard Gesell and Harold Greene, appointees of earlier 
Democratic administrations. Oliver North was convicted of three 
felonies in the trial in Gesell's courtroom and President Reagan's 
national security adviser, John Poindexter, was convicted of five 
felonies in the trial that Greene presided over. Convictions in 
both cases were overturned on appeal.

<HEADLINE>  20th Swiss Disaster Victim Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- The body of one of the last  
tourists missing in a Swiss Alps river flood was found, bringing 
the death count from the canyoning disaster to 20, Bern state 
police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers using underwater cameras located the body late Friday  
night, 207 feet deep in Lake Brienz, a few miles downstream from 
the scene of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy occurred when unexpected floods swept through the  
canyon and engulfed tourists and guides bodysurfing feet-first 
through foaming waters of Saxeten Brook, near Interlaken Alpine 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was still missing. Police said they would suspend the  
search until Monday to give exhausted rescuers a chance to recover. 
The rescue effort would continue to concentrate on Lake Brienz. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were ``canyoning,'' a new extreme sport in which  
participants slide, jump or rappel down waterfalls and mountain 
streams into gorges without rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Friday they were investigating whether five  
guides on the expedition, hosted by Adventure World, were guilty of 
negligent homicide for not taking notice of a pending storm, which 
caused the floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Another three guides who went with the group of 45 vacationers  
were among those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police so far have released the names of nine victims. Relatives  
are still helping identify the badly battered bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is scheduled for Thursday in Interlaken.

<HEADLINE> Reds Get Juan Guzman From Orioles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- This time, the Cincinnati Reds got a pitcher  
instead of trading one away. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got starter Juan Guzman from the Baltimore Orioles for  
two minor league pitchers and cash late Saturday night, a sign of 
how far they've come. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two years, the Reds made news by trading starter  
Dave Burba and closer Jeff Shaw for prospects. This time, the 
small-market surprise of the season showed it is serious about 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all knew we needed pitching and the people in this  
organization are dedicated to trying to win,'' general manager Jim 
Bowden said. ``No one thought a payroll in the $30 million range 
would have a winning record let alone be two games out of the 
playoffs (as a wild card) right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles got minor league pitchers B.J. Ryan and Jacobo  
Sequea and agreed to send the Reds an undisclosed amount of cash to 
pay part of Guzman's $5.25 million salary. 
</P>
<P>
	It marked the second year in a row that Guzman, 32, was traded  
on July 31. The Toronto Blue Jays sent him to the Orioles for 
pitcher Nerio Rodriguez and minor league outfielder Shannon Carter 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have beaten the odds by staying in first or second  
place in the NL Central since June 16 despite a small payroll -- $33 
million on opening day. They were looking for another starter for 
their injury-thinned rotation, but weren't about to give up top 
prospects or add to their payroll substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Orioles agreed to help pay Guzman's salary, the deal  
was done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not want to trade anyone on our 25-man roster. We  
didn't want to trade anyone from our bullpen,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman will be a free agent after this season. He went 5-9 with  
a 4.18 ERA and one complete game in 21 starts for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds felt they had to upgrade their rotation, which has been  
their main weakness all season. The problem was that they didn't 
want to trade any of their top prospects or substantially add to 
their payroll. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into their 11-1 loss to San Francisco on Saturday, Reds  
starters had pitched only 554 innings, tied with Minnesota for 
fewest in the major leagues. On average, a Reds starter lasts 5 1-3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The bullpen has saved the club so far, turning in a 2.92 ERA  
that is the best in the majors. But it also has thrown 354 1-3 
innings, second-most in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get our starter to go six or seven innings, we feel we  
have the best bullpen in the league and a chance to win every 
game,'' Bowden said. ``We're getting a starting pitcher who's given 
the Orioles six or seven innings nearly every time out, especially 
since the middle of June.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman had a 3.16 ERA in June and a 3.62 ERA in July.  
</P>
<P>
	Ryan, a left-hander, was the Reds' 17th-round pick in last  
year's draft and made a remarkably quick rise through the farm 
system. Ryan, 23, made it to Double-A last season and represented 
the Reds in the All-Star Futures Game at Boston this July. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds called him up from Triple-A last Monday, giving him the  
quickest rise through Cincinnati's farm system since C.J. Nitkowski 
made his debut in 1995, one year after being drafted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan made one appearance for the Reds, then was optioned to  
Triple-A on Friday to open a roster spot for Denny Neagle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have (left-handers) Gabe White and Dennys Reyes in the  
bullpen, and you've got to give up something to get something,'' 
Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sequea, 17, was 4-6 with a 4.92 ERA in 16 starts for Class A  
Rockford.

<HEADLINE> Firm Won't Appeal Paula Jones Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' law firm won't seek more  
than the $79,999 it was awarded for fees incurred due to President 
Clinton's false testimony about his relationship with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not to appeal by the Dallas-based firm of Rader,  
Campbell, Fisher &AMP; Pyke all but wraps up Mrs. Jones' dispute with 
Clinton, who has said he is willing to comply with the court order 
issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that more attorneys fees were caused by his lying,  
but Judge Wright didn't see it that way and so it's over,'' lawyer 
Wes Holmes said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of The Rutherford Institute, a Virginia-based  
conservative group that also worked for Mrs. Jones, said he likely 
would decide next week whether to appeal the institute's $9,485 
award, but would prefer to let the case end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're weighing the money, the attorney time, the chance factor  
with the court and then probably as big of a factor: Do we want to 
be in this case for another year?'' said Rutherford President John 
W. Whitehead. 
</P>
<P>
	The law firm had sought $437,825 and The Rutherford Institute  
had sought $58,533. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attorneys have said the president will not appeal the  
$90,686 payment he was ordered to compensate for legal costs 
related to what the judge called his ``false, misleading and 
evasive answers'' in his January 1998 deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's denials of a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky led  
to his impeachment by the House. The Senate acquitted him after a 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit April 1,  
1998, but Clinton agreed to an $850,000 settlement after Mrs. Jones 
appealed the dismissal. Clinton admitted no wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Glimpses of Shooting Victims' Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Charles Allen Tenenbaum discussed buying burial  
plots with his wife only last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he had a premonition of anything,'' said Rabbi  
S. Robert Ichay. ``But he knew that life was not always the way we 
imagine it, or the way we would like it to be -- that things could 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Tenenbaum was the first of nine people who died in a  
shooting rampage to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people attended Tenenbaum's funeral, hastily  
arranged in keeping with the Jewish law forbidding funerals on the 
Sabbath, which began at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	The Great Savings Grocery, the family-owned grocery where  
Tenenbaum worked, was closed the day after he and eight others were 
fatally shot by Mark O. Barton. Like Barton, Tenenbaum, 48, was a 
day trader at one of the stock brokerages where the slaughter 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, a stream of mourners gathered at the store to pay  
respects. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the neighborhood liked him,'' said Thomas Glass,  
who recently retired after working as a butcher there for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ichay said Tenenbaum was planning his first pilgrimage to Israel  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the victims, like 36-year-old Texas native Kevin Dial,  
worked for the firms that Barton targeted. Others, like 52-year-old 
Dean Delawalla, were customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not specify which victim was where or doing what,  
but friends and witnesses provided glimpses into their lives and 
last hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial, the son of former Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys  
wide receiver Buddy Dial, was office manager at Momentum 
Securities, where the shooting began. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin was the light of his life,'' said Tom Alexandar,  
attorney for Buddy Dial, who is recovering from a stroke. ``He was 
a very, very bright, wonderful young man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Blaier, an Allegiance Telecom sales manager who worked down  
the hall from Dial, called him ``probably one of the happiest guys 
I ever saw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another victim, Edward Quinn, was a 58-year-old father of three  
and day trader. He was only a couple of years into his retirement 
after decades with United Parcel Service, where he last served as 
southeast regional director for security and loss prevention. 
Friends and neighbors said Quinn seemed to have three passions, 
beside his family: his lawn, flyfishing and golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he retired his plan was to begin traveling the world and  
playing at all the great old courses across the planet,'' said Ken 
Sternad, a UPS spokesman who had known Quinn for 10 years. ``That 
was his goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just three weeks ago, Quinn traveled to St. Louis after the  
birth of his first grandson, Bryce. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a tremendous family man,'' son Michael Quinn said  
through sobs. ``Would bend over backwards in any way, shape or form 
to help his family out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the victims had nothing to do with the stock market at  
all. 
</P>
<P>
	Vadewattee Muralidhara, 44, had just moved to Atlanta from tiny  
Swainsboro three months ago with her pediatrician husband. The 
soft-spoken homemaker and mother of two college-aged children was 
at the office building to take a computer course, said her friend 
Peggy Corbin. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing I would say is she was a very sweet-spirited  
person,'' Corbin said. ``Just very dedicated to her children. They 
were her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until a couple of months ago, victim Scott Webb, 30, lived with  
his father in Chesterfield, an upscale community in west St. Louis 
County, Mo. Neighbors said the two biked and jogged together. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed were 42-year-old Russell Brown of Cumming, Ga.;  
Joseph J. Dessert, 60, Marietta, Ga.; and Jamshid Havash, 44, of 
Dunwoody, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	Delawalla doted on his son, Faisal, 15, encouraging him to play  
hockey, soccer, tennis and football, said his brother, Fred 
Delawalla. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never think (something) like this could strike this close  
until it happens and ... all of a sudden the realities sort of come 
to the surface,'' he said. ``That you're living in a glass world 
here.''

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stock market day traders are warned by firms  
of the enormous stress they will face and the risk of being 
financially wiped out. But they're also told they can be their own 
bosses and strike it rich. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators, who have cracked down on a number of  
day-trading firms for alleged abuses, said Friday the majority of 
those investigated have overblown the potential profits and played 
down the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	And some psychology experts said the anxiety generated by  
intense, volatile day trading of stocks by computer can lead the 
players to take their frustrations out on their families and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark O. Barton, who shot and killed nine people at two  
day-trading firms in Atlanta on Thursday, was one of a band of 
about 5,000 investors around the country who trade full-time, 
paying the firms that host them a commission for each trade. These 
players ride the tiniest ups and downs of the stock markets, 
squeezing profits by rapidly buying and selling shares 
electronically. Thousands of dollars of their own money are on the 
line, requiring nerves of steel and the ability to make snap 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The day traders, many of whom have abandoned their regular jobs,  
are distinct from the 5 million or so amateur investors who 
occasionally trade on the Internet at home or at work. 
</P>
<P>
	For day traders, the market IS their work -- every day, from  
opening bell to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Day-trading firms, sometimes in response to pressure from  
securities regulators, warn potential customers of the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site of All-Tech Investment Group Inc., a company where  
Barton traded, carries this statement: ``Warning: Active electronic 
stock trading is risky. Participants should be aware of, and 
capable of assuming the inherent risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Wolff, owner of Equity Trading, a day-trading firm on  
the sixth floor of New York's Empire State Building, said the 
company managers use weekly seminars to inform investors of risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stress that this business is not for everybody,'' Wolff  
said. ``You could potentially lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some firms lure prospective day traders with aggressive  
advertising promising instant wealth and the opportunity to break 
free from a traditional job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are boundless opportunities,'' James H. Lee, chairman  
and president of the Electronic Traders Association, said in an 
interview earlier this year. ``There's a great deal of success in 
the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Beauchamp, a spokesman for the North American Securities  
Administrators Association, said most day traders lose money. Most 
firms that have run into trouble ``have misled customers by 
exaggerating the potential profits of day trading and downplaying 
the risks of losses,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last fall, Massachusetts has filed or settled complaints  
against seven firms. One firm promised a ``six- to seven-figure 
income per year,'' said securities regulators. Another said 85 
percent of its customers succeeded. In Texas, authorities closed 
two firms accused of operating without state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush for stock market gold can create extreme anxiety, in  
the view of some behavioral experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very high-pressure situation. ... I've seen people hit  
the wrong (computer) key out of anxiety'' while day trading, said 
Steven Hendlin, a clinical psychologist in Irvine, Calif. ``There's 
a lot of coffee drinking, a lot of squirming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The exasperation of a day of market losses can make a trader  
irritable around family and friends or make the person withdraw, 
said Hendlin, who is writing a book on day trading. ``A guy may 
blame his wife and not even be consciously aware of the cause of 
his anger,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharp swings between gains and losses ``have emotional  
consequences. ... It can be all-consuming for people,'' said Dr. 
Jeffrey Kahn, a New York psychiatrist who is the president of 
WorkPsych Associates, a corporate mental health consulting firm. 
``There may be problem traders who are not too different from 
problem gamblers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coincidental to the shootings, the National Association of  
Securities Dealers, which governs the Nasdaq Stock Market, approved 
a rule Thursday requiring firms that promote day trading to 
disclose the risks to customers -- before they open accounts.

	Cool Air, Rain Bring Relief from Heat  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Raging heat that has been blamed for 144 deaths  
across the nation is still a problem for much of the country, but 
slightly cooler weather is edging into the Midwest, bringing rain 
and storms to several states. Sporadic heavy rain and thunderstorms 
swept through parts of Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Kansas and 
Indiana. In Chicago, however, 26 more people have died from the 
heat, pushing Illinois' heat-related death toll to 50.

	1,010 Gypsies Seek Refuge in Italy  
</P>
<P>
	BARI, Italy (AP) -- More than 1,000 illegal immigrants traveling  
in an old tugboat landed in southern Italy today under Italian 
military escort, the biggest single arrival in a weeks-long influx 
of Gypsies from Yugoslavia. Authorities said 489 of the 1,010 
aboard were children. The would-be refugees burst into applause 
when they docked at the southern port of Bari. Thousands of Gypsies 
have landed illegally in Italy since the war in Kosovo ended, with 
many saying they were fleeing revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians 
in the Serbian province.

	Heat May Be Factor in Fatal Plane Crash

<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Federal investigators say  
heat may have been a factor in the plane crash that killed nine 
skydivers and a pilot today. The National Transportation Safety 
Board says hot weather and high humidity can make takeoff more 
difficult. Temperatures today reached into the 80s. The plane, a 
twin-engine Beech King Air 200, came down in a grassy field near 
Marine City Airport, about 40 miles north of Detroit, police said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans have set a Tuesday deadline to  
sculpt a $792 billion tax cut compromise that can clear the House 
and Senate by week's end and set the stage for a fall veto showdown 
with the White House. With the hurry-up compromise effort scarcely 
under way, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott criticized President 
Clinton for opposing the measure. ``We should reduce taxes, with 
the largest middle-class tax cut since Ronald Reagan was 
president,'' Lott said in today's weekly GOP radio address.

	Deals Shape Up As Deadline Looms  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics shuffled their staff,  
getting Kevin Appier from the Kansas City Royals and sending Billy 
Taylor to the New York Mets. The Mets also made a five-player swap 
with Colorado, getting outfielder Darryl Hamilton and reliever 
Chuck McElroy for outfielder Brian McRae and two minor leaguers. 
Also moving to New York -- again -- was Jim Leyritz, a 
former-postseason hero for the Yankees who was reacquired from the 
San Diego Padres for a minor league pitcher. Oakland traded three 
young pitchers for Appier: Blake Stein, Jeff D'Amico and Brad 
Rigby. Oakland, 3 1/2 games behind Toronto in the AL wild-card hunt, 
got pitcher Jason Isringhausen for the 37-year-old Taylor, who has 
26 saves.

<HEADLINE> Compton on Pole for NASCAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUDON, N.H. (AP) -- Stacy Compton, who'll start Sunday's NASCAR  
Craftsman Truck Series Pennzoil 200 from the pole position, is 
running out of chances to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Compton, winner of his fourth pole of the season in Friday's  
qualifying at New Hampshire International Raceway, has yet to 
parlay a single lap's speed into a victory as the season moves into 
its final nine races. 
</P>
<P>
	He's been close but, without wins, also has began to lose  
contact with the tour's championship leaders. Compton, whose Dodge 
qualified at 126.745 mph to edge Impact Motorsports partner Randy 
Tolsma for the pole, is 182 points behind leader Jack Sprague and 
97 behind second-place Greg Biffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's race isn't a must-win situation. But it's close.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we'd have been struggling, sure, it would be aggravating,''  
agreed Compton, who counts two second-place finishes among eight 
top-five efforts in the season's first 16 races. ``We've run up 
front every week. We just need a little luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Compton also qualified first a week ago at Michigan Speedway,  
where he was in contention until damaging his truck's radiator in 
the waning laps. He finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming up short, when we knew we had a truck that could win,  
that was aggravating,'' said Compton, who finished 15th in last 
year's Pennzoil 200 when he qualified 23rd. The two-time series 
winner hasn't won in 25 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's qualifying marked the second time in 1999 that Compton  
and Tolsma share the front row. Tolsma, whose nearly identical 
Dodge was nine-thousandths of a second slower than Compton with a 
speed of 126.707, was the pole winner in the year's opening race at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Tolsma is also looking to break a lengthy losing streak, a run  
of 46 races dating to October 1997 in Bakersfield, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending series champion and 1996 Pennzoil 200 winner Ron  
Hornaday qualified a Chevrolet third at 126.194 mph. He'll share 
row two of Sunday's race with Rick Crawford, whose Ford lapped at 
126.115. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Harvick, who has three runnerup finishes in 1999, grabbed  
fifth in a Ford at 126.098. The year's hottest competitor, Biffle, 
was sixth in a Ford at 126.069. Biffle has won two races in a row 
and four of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague was seventh in a Chevrolet, followed by Rob Morgan, Mike  
Bliss and Dennis Setzer. Last year's Pennzoil 200 pole winner, Mike 
Wallace, qualified 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making the 33-driver field was NASCAR Winston Cup veteran  
Joe Ruttman, who'll start 14th in a Dodge. Last year's race winner, 
Andy Houston, starts 16th, just ahead of Jay Sauter, who won the 
1997 event at the 1.058-mile superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Former NFL coach Jerry Glanville, recovered from injuries during  
qualifying for last week's NASCAR Busch Series race at Colorado 
Springs, Colo., starts 29th.

<HEADLINE> Flawed Software Vulnerable Via Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Flaws in the Microsoft Office software suite  
could be used by pranksters or cybercrooks through e-mail or rogue 
Web sites to retrieve, alter or erase data in computers used by 
millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Some newer Compaq and Hewlett-Packard computers that can be  
upgraded automatically over the Internet also contain flaws that 
could be similarly exploited, but only over the Web, security 
experts have found. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to take advantage of either set of vulnerabilities  
would not be detected or prevented by antivirus software but there 
is no evidence that such mischief has occurred, said Russ Cooper of 
Lindsay, Ontario, in a telephone interview Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper, who runs a Windows NT security mailing list called  
NTbugtraq, said Microsoft developers expect to have an Office fix 
ready as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Dixon, group product manager for Office, did not return a  
call for comment and other knowledgeable Microsoft officials also 
were unavailable, company spokesman Dan Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Schiller, computer security chief at the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology, said the problems illustrate the pitfalls 
of upgrading programs over the Web or through e-mail despite the 
convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not clear to me that it's a wise idea to write all these  
scripting files ... that let you completely control the computer,'' 
Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the flaws are known, recreational hackers and criminals  
may well be scrambling to take advantage of them before the fixes 
are in place, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
	The vulnerabilities were first reported Saturday in The New York  
Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Viruses typically have spread through macros, small programs  
combining a series of commands. A computer user opening e-mail or 
importing material from a Web site with macros typically is alerted 
and may disable the macros or reject documents and files that 
contain them. 
</P>
<P>
	The new vulnerability is from a different source.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Juan Carlos Cuartango, a programmer who previously  
found security gaps in Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape 
Navigator, discovered that Internet Explorer and Windows are 
configured to ``trust'' Word, Excel, Powerpoint and other Office 
program documents. They may be used as Trojan Horses to implant 
malicious code into a computer, triggering low-level operating 
system commands that could change or destroy files or even an 
entire hard drive without resorting to macros. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bug that needs to be fixed, a bug of huge  
proportions,'' Cooper said. ``The ramifications are quite large.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Office 2000 and some of the final versions of Office 97 are free  
from the flaw, but it is present in millions of installed versions 
of Office 97 and probably also in many older versions, possibly 
dating as far back as 1992, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dixon told the Times that Microsoft may offer a mechanism to  
alert computer users of embedded system commands and data base 
queries before they are executed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take security issues very seriously,'' he said. ``Right  
now, we are working on testing a solution and steps for customers 
to take.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Compaq flaw was detected in November by Frank Farance of  
Farance Inc., an information technology consultant, and 
rediscovered July 23 by Richard Smith, president of Pharlap 
Software in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	It involves a Java applet, or small program, that allows the  
quick upgrade of Compaq Presario computer programs over the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But the applet also can be directed by a Web page to reveal  
e-mail lists, release financial records or provide addresses, phone 
listings and credit card numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he found a similar problem with some Hewlett-Packard  
computers. Hewlet-Packard officials would not discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	A Compaq spokesman said other computer makers have similar  
problems and suggested there was little chance that a hacker could 
make malicious use of the applet. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Compaq plans to instruct users on how to disable the  
utility for now, then will offer an improved applet that is being 
designed to prevent breaches.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hurt by Illegal Gas Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia must crack down on illegal gasoline exports  
that are contributing to gas shortages and rising prices, the 
country's fuel and energy minister said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Kalyuzhny said the main reason for the shortage is rising  
global oil prices, which have prompted Russian oil companies to 
funnel their goods to lucrative foreign markets instead of selling 
them at home, where prices are lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But in addition to the illegal exports, small traders are also  
buying gasoline and secretly exporting ``significant volumes,'' 
Kalyuzhny said, according to Russian television and news agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kalyuzhny spoke during a visit to the Black Sea resort of Sochi,  
which has been hit particularly hard by gasoline shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other officials blamed Sochi's problems on a dramatic  
rise in tourists this year. Many Russians hurt by last year's 
financial meltdown are abandoning expensive foreign resorts for 
cheaper vacation spots like Sochi. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shortage may also be acute in Sochi because the region  
is close to Black Sea ports used to ship gasoline illegally to 
foreign buyers, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The gasoline shortage puts the cash-starved government in a  
precarious spot. Oil exports are the government's main source of 
hard currency and rallying oil prices bring a welcome boost in tax 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	But with parliamentary elections in December, the government is  
keen to avoid public anger over rising gasoline prices. It has 
threatened to restrict oil exports to guarantee enough gasoline for 
domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> 'Radar' Makes Comback After Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dropping of the radar screen cost Gary Burghoff,  
best known for his portrayal of ``Radar'' in ``M A S H,'' a good 
deal of cash over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Burghoff told the Aug. 9 edition of People that his decision to  
turn down acting roles after his seven year stint on the popular 
series reduced his income sharply, and he was forced to file for 
bankruptcy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was down to my last $500,'' the 56-year-old said. ``The  
money ran out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the actor is in financial shape these days. He sells his  
canvas drawings of wildlife for $25,000 each; he is acting on stage 
again, and is soon to appear in the 120-city tour of Neil Simon's 
``The Last of the Red Hot Lovers''; and is the new host of the 
public television series, ``Pets: Part of the Family.''

</P>
<P>
	Ike Ibeabuchi, 26, known as ``The President'' in the ring, was

<HEADLINE> Padres' Leyritz Returns to Yanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jim Leyritz is going back to the New York  
Yankees, meaning he once again could be hitting clutch October home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees reacquired the former World Series hero by sending  
minor league right-hander Geraldo Padua to the San Diego Padres on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz denied requesting a trade to New York, but thanked the  
Padres for sending him there. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have traded me anywhere, but it shows the class of  
this organization to give me another opportunity back in New 
York,'' said the 35-year-old utility player, who will be eligible 
for free agency after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a big reason the Padres had more than just the Yankees  
calling about Leyritz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a good hitter and he loves the spotlight,'' Yankees  
manager Joe Torre said before Saturday's game in Boston. ``That's 
half the battle when you've got ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of Leyritz's 12 postseason hits, seven are homers. Four have  
come after the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	None was bigger than his three-run homer off Atlanta's Mark  
Wohlers that helped change the course of the 1996 World Series. His 
eighth-inning shot tied Game 4 at 6, and the Yankees went on to win 
in 10 innings and defeated the Braves in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you play for teams that win, you get that little fire,''  
said Leyritz, who will join the Yankees in Boston for Sunday 
night's game. ``Playing in New York for as many years as I did, 
it's almost like being in the World Series every day. I thrived on 
it while I was there. My focus just seems to get better when the 
at-bat matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, who swept the Padres in last year's World Series,  
had the best record in the majors going into Saturday's games but 
lost to the Red Sox, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a friend of all of ours,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter  
said of Leyritz. ``He was part of the '96 team. He's valuable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz's first dramatic playoff homer came in 1995, a two-run  
shot in the 15th inning at Yankee Stadium off Seattle's Tim Belcher 
that ended the longest AL division series game. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz began his career with the Yankees in 1990 and was traded  
to Anaheim in December 1996. He also played for Texas and Boston 
before being traded to San Diego on June 21, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's first-round playoff series, Leyritz homered in  
three straight games against the Houston Astros, providing the 
winning run in Game 3 and then connecting off Randy Johnson for a 
1-0 lead in the clinching fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
	He homered once in the NL championship series against Atlanta,  
but went 0-for-10 in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was terrific here,'' Padres general manager Kevin Towers  
said. ``He's a great player and had some big hits for us. I'm sure 
he'll be very successful for the New York Yankees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz broke a bone in his left hand June 22 and was activated  
from the disabled list Friday night. He admitted that he's only 
about 80 percent of full strength and is 10-12 days away from being 
able to catch. He can also play first or third base, or be used as 
the designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz is hitting .239 with eight home runs and 21 RBIs. He won  
two of the Padres' first eight games this year with homers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz's injury opened the way for the Padres to promote rookie  
catcher Ben Davis, who's been living up to his billing as the 
Padres' top non-pitching prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't view this as just because we moved Jim Leyritz we're  
conceding the season and throwing in the towel,'' said Towers, 
whose club has gone from two games out of first place in the NL 
West to eight back after losing eight straight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres were attempting to trade for a third baseman before  
Saturday night's deadline. On Friday night, they designated 
struggling George Arias for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Padres can't land a third baseman, they'll take a look at  
Phil Nevin, the top pick in the June 1992 draft who's now with his 
fourth big league club, and outfielder Eric Owens. They also have 
Carlos Baerga. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego has traded two catchers in six days for pitching  
prospects. On Monday, they sent Greg Myers to Atlanta for 
right-hander Doug Dent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we've added two very good arms to the system,'' Towers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Padua, a 22-year-old from the Dominican Republic, was 9-4 with a  
2.86 ERA in 21 starts with Class A Greensboro. He was second in the 
South Atlantic League with 155 strikeouts in 139 2-3 innings, with 
only 35 walks. He'll report to Class A Rancho Cucamonga.

<HEADLINE> Braves Get Mulholland, Hernandez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves, facing a serious challenge in  
the NL East, acquired infielder Jose Hernandez and pitcher Terry 
Mulholland from the Chicago Cubs just before Saturday's midnight 
EDT trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves sent pitcher Micah Bowie, minor league pitcher Ruben  
Quevedo and a minor leaguer to be named later to the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made the deal with 30 seconds to go ... or less,'' said  
Braves general manager John Schuerholz, who talked with four or 
five teams during the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta dropped to second place in the NL East on Friday, the  
latest they've been out of first since 1994. The Braves regained 
the top spot by a half-game over the New York Mets with an 8-6 
victory Saturday night over the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies are 5 1/2 games back.  
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, who is hitting .272 with 15 homers and 43 RBIs,  
bolsters a lineup that has been without first baseman Andres 
Galarraga all season and learned Monday that catcher Javy Lopez 
would be out for the rest of the year with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Cox can use Hernandez at either second, short,  
third and the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose offensive production like we have with Galarraga  
and Lopez, it's hurtful,'' Schuerholz said. ``I don't mean to 
suggest that Hernandez will replace that. But it will give Bobby 
another weapon offensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, 30, also provides insurance at short, where starter  
Walt Weiss has been plagued by leg problems since joining the 
Braves before the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland, who is 6-6 with a 5.15 ERA, adds depth to a pitching  
staff that has struggled to find a fifth starter and has managed to 
get by with a nondescript bullpen. The 36-year-old can start or 
relieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people have high regard for his competitiveness and his  
ability to perform a variety of roles,'' Schuerholz said. ``He 
affords us some protection if John Smoltz's elbow bothers him the 
rest of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz has been on the disabled list twice this season -- just  
one in a series of problems that have plagued a team seeking to 
extend its own record of seven straight postseason appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	It began in spring training when Galarraga was diagnosed with  
cancer in his back, forcing him to miss the season while undergoing 
treatment. Shortly afterward, closer Kerry Ligtenberg suffered a 
season-ending elbow injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss and Smoltz have struggled with injuries all season, but at  
least they are still able to play. On Monday, the Braves learned 
that Lopez partially tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his 
right knee and 21-year-old fifth starter Odalis Perez tore the 
medial collateral ligament in his left elbow. Both needed 
season-ending operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had to suffer through losses to some very key guys,''  
Schuerholz said. ``To get two players who have been productive and 
are very experienced will help make up for the loss of those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, 24, was 0-1 with a 13.50 ERA for the Braves after being  
called up recently from Triple-A Richmond. Quevedo, who is not on 
Atlanta's 40-man roster, was 6-5 with a 5.37 ERA in 21 games at 
Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland has another year on the contract that pays him $2.925  
million this season. Hernandez is making $2.4 million in the final 
year of his contract.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Johnson Back After Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- LeShon Johnson had a special reason for  
following Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de France last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was inspirational story of an athlete who not only overcame  
cancer, but then got back into shape and won cycling's greatest 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson can identify with someone like that.  
</P>
<P>
	Just five months ago, the New York Giants' running back posted  
his victory over cancer. Now the 28-year-old wants his professional 
life back, and he's going through twice-a-days workouts with the 
Giants at the University at Albany to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am determined to got out there and show people with the same  
sickness that I had that you can always come back,'' Johnson said 
Saturday. ``Just because I was sick, I didn't throw in the towel 
and say, `Hey, this is it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That might have been easy with the discovery of his lymphoma  
cancer in May 1998. It came just two months after Johnson had left 
the Arizona Cardinals and signed with the Giants as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	While his new teammates were at training camp at this time last  
year, Johnson was preparing to start chemotherapy to treat a 
grapefruit-sized tumor in his chest. Radiation would follow in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemotherapy was bearable. Johnson even worked out during  
his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radiation lasts five or 10 minutes, and after the first one I  
said, `This is easy,''' Johnson said. ``By the third and fourth 
one, I found myself getting tired. It kicked my butt, but I had to 
keep pushing myself to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last radiation treatment came on Jan. 27. Johnson doesn't  
hesitate in recalling the date. On Feb. 21, he was diagnosed as 
cancer free. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of workouts, Johnson reported to camp Thursday at  
212 pounds, four over his playing weight. And with starting 
halfback Gary Brown sidelined with an injury resulting from a 
motorcycle accident last month, Johnson is running with the first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also looking to write a story as improbable as Armstrong's.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to see him back on the field after the year he's had,  
it's good,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``I think he can be an 
inspiration to other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reading about Armstrong's experiences over the past month also  
helped Johnson prepare for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff like that pushes you to strive a lot harder to reach a  
goal,'' Johnson, a six-year veteran whose best season was in 1996 
when he gained 634 yards on 141 carries. ``He's a great guy to look 
up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former bull rider in rodeos, Johnson admitted he's been a  
little fatigued working out in temperatures in the 90-degree range 
the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm prepared to get beat up on and carry the load 25-30 times  
a game,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants aren't going to let that happen right away.  
</P>
<P>
	``After we get through with the preseason, we'll have a better  
indicator,'' offensive coordinator Jim Skipper said. ``It's still a 
little early, but, hey, he's looking the same as he was in Arizona. 
We have to see his endurance.''

<HEADLINE> Bipartisan Tax-Cut Effort Fizzles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts to craft a $500 billion bipartisan tax  
cut fizzled unceremoniously in the Senate on Thursday as political 
lines hardened and President Clinton reinforced his threat to veto 
a larger Republican tax relief package. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe America wants to be governed from the center, and  
America needs to be governed from the center,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, 
R-Pa., said of the bipartisan proposal, which roughly split the 
difference between the GOP's $792 billion tax cut and a smaller 
$290 billion version advanced by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a leading architect of the  
proposal, conceded, ``Neither party at this time is supportive.'' 
After more than an hour of debate, Breaux withdrew the measure 
without so much as a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The developments came as the Senate marched methodically toward  
approval of the GOP-crafted bill, with tax breaks for individuals, 
families, education, retirement accounts and numerous other 
provisions. A final vote was set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	House-Senate talks are expected to begin this weekend, and GOP  
leaders harbor hopes of passing the resulting compromise through 
both houses next week. That would enable Republicans to spend 
Congress' August break touting the virtue of their measure, and set 
the stage for a fall confrontation with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Before boarding Air Force One for a flight to Europe, Clinton  
renewed his threat to veto the bill, saying it was too large and 
``risky'' for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with the American people sharing the surplus?  
After all, it belongs to them,'' rebutted Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
R-Alaska. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who shepherded a 
companion bill to passage last week, added, ``I don't think it's 
risky to have faith in the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's threatened veto, coupled with the Senate's arcane  
rules, turned the lengthy debate on the Senate floor into political 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, maneuvering for advantage, called for reducing the  
GOP tax measure to provide room for a new prescription drug benefit 
for Medicare recipients. But the vote came on a parliamentary 
motion rather than on any specific proposal to provide prescription 
drug benefits to the nation's elderly. And it gained the support of 
only 45 senators -- all but one of them Democrats -- far below the 60 
votes it needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This debate is about priorities. New tax breaks are a priority  
for the Republicans,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. 
``Prescription drugs for senior citizens are not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., countered that as chairman of the  
committee with jurisdiction over Medicare, the Senate Finance 
Committee, he intended to address ``this most important concern'' 
as soon as lawmakers return to Washington from their scheduled 
August break. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., sharply rebutted Democratic claims  
that the GOP tax bill wouldn't leave room for a new Medicare 
benefit. Instead, he sought to turn the political tables. 
</P>
<P>
	A veto by Clinton, he said, would wipe out provisions to make  
education more affordable and child care more accessible. ``Where 
does he get off running around the land saying he's for education 
and we're not?'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and other Republicans  
sought to substitute an across-the-board tax cut similar to the 
House measure for a portion of the bill pending in the Senate. That 
proposal, too, was rejected on a parliamentary motion after 
politically tinged debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argued the change would make the measure more  
favorable to the wealthy at the expense of lower-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gramm said 50 percent of Americans pay only 4.3 percent of  
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't get a tax cut because they don't pay income  
taxes,'' he said. ``Tax cuts are for taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each side also labored to show its backing for popular programs  
for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pushed a ``lockbox'' amendment that they said would  
set aside surpluses generated by payroll tax revenue for Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a similar proposal that would have  
offered protection to Medicare, as well as Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Both approaches were rejected.  
</P>
<P>
	As written, the GOP proposal called for reducing the 15 percent  
income tax rate to 14 percent, effective in 2001. Beginning in 
2005, the new 14 percent tax rate would apply to some income that 
is now taxed at 28 percent. Together, those provisions account for 
nearly $300 billion of the $792 billion measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also includes relief from the so-called marriage  
penalty that forces some couples to pay more in taxes than they 
would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also contains several provisions to assist taxpayers  
with retirement accounts, to provide tax breaks for education and 
long-term health care, and to reduce estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the doomed bipartisan proposal would have increased  
the standard deduction by $4,300 for joint tax filers, $2,150 for 
heads of households and $1,300 for single filers. Supporters said 
that change would have eliminated the marriage penalty for many 
taxpayers and simplified tax filing for millions of Americans.

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- An unidentified Canadian athlete  
failed a drug test at the Pan American Games, the host nation's 
Olympic committee confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Olympic Association would not say which sport was  
involved or when the doping infraction occurred. But the Pan 
American Sports Organization notified the COA that a Canadian 
athlete tested positive for a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	PASO's Medical Commission said it will render a decision Sunday  
on whether a doping infraction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first positive test at these games.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. baseball team moved one victory from a spot in the  
Sydney Olympics when it beat Panama 5-2. If it beats Mexico on 
Sunday -- the squad of minor leaguers already did that last Tuesday 
-- it earns a berth in the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	American tennis, softball and soccer players were very stingy,  
and the women's basketball team was anything but, leaving it to the 
men to salvage U.S. pride on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The medals race is a runaway, with the United States at 172 (69  
gold), followed by Canada with 102 (31 gold) and Cuba with 89 (33 
gold). 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was more dominating than 18-year-old tennis phenom  
Alexandra Stevenson, who routed Francine Harvey of Antiqua 6-0, 
6-0. It was her first double shutout since she was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, the first woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals as a  
qualifier, has lost two games in four sets. She has spent as much 
time concentrating on collecting pins as on her groundstrokes and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly looking for pins from other countries,'' said  
Stevenson, whose opponent asked for her autograph after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman in action was Lilia Osterloh, who defeated  
Joelle Schad of the Dominican Republic 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Mamiitt beat Simon Ebelyn of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 6-3, 6-4;  
Bob Bryan was a 6-1, 6-1 winner of Felix Insaurralde of Paraguay; 
and Paul Goldstein downed Jermaine Smith of Jamaica 7-5, 6-0 in 
men's play. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's world champions in softball got their third straight  
shutout as they beat the Netherlands Antilles 7-0 behind the 
three-hit pitching of Lori Harrigan. In the three games, the 
Americans have outscored their opponents 21-0, allowing only four 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a left-hander, walked only one and struck out nine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime your pitchers go out and don't allow any runs, you  
have to be happy with their performance,'' coach Ralph Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Douty led an 11-hit U.S. attack with two hits and two  
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men were just as strong, winning over the Dominican  
Republic 12-0 in six innings. Doug Middleton struck out 16 of 18 
batters and allowed only one hit. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3-0 victory over Canada gave the U.S. women's soccer squad an  
18-1 scoring edge in the preliminary round and first place in its 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team totally stepped up,'' Marcia Wallis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 0-0 tie with weak Uruguay, the American men's soccer  
team also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of those strong victories came a poor performance  
from the women's basketball squad, which sustained its worst Pan 
Ams loss ever, 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban women overwhelmed the United States with quickness,  
slashing drives to the basket and a trapping zone defense. They 
jumped to a 14-3 lead in the first five minutes and the Americans 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good, but we know we're a lot better defensive team  
than that,'' forward Lynn Pride said. ``We had a lot of breakdowns. 
We usually rely on our help, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No such problems for the U.S. men's squad of CBA all-stars.  
Sparked by the shot-swatting defense of 7-foot Mikki Moore, they 
rolled past Cuba 89-48 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Thomas led the Americans with 17 points. Moore contributed  
seven points, five rebounds and three blocks and generally 
intimidated any Cuban who thought of shooting near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, I had some jitters early,'' Moore said. ``I  
got a few blocks and that got my blood flowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won three out of five boxing matches.  
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Gerald Tucker, light heavyweight Joe Pastorello and  
light welterweight Corey Bernard easily moved into the second round 
with lopsided victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, romped to a 24-4 win over Cesar Morales  
of Mexico. Pastorello of Colorado Springs, Colo., was an 11-2 
winner against Francisco Garcia of the Dominican. The referee 
stopped Bernard's bout against round Elkena Saunders of the Bahamas 
in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker forced a standing-8 count in the first round and then  
eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many butterflies before this bout, and then to top  
things off I was the first bout,'' he said. ``I just felt I had to 
continue what was started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won their first two bouts on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The losing U.S. fighters were Ron Siler of Cincinnati, beaten by  
Cuba's Maikros Romero in light flyweight, and lightweight Jason 
Ingwaldson of Henderson, Nev.,who was stopped in the second round 
by Fabricio Nieva of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	John Patterson pitched 5 2-3 hitless innings Saturday night and  
allowed two hits in eight innings. The 6-foot-5 Patterson, a 
Double-A pitcher in the Arizona Diamondbacks' organization, had not 
given up a hit when he fumbled Earl Agnoly's bunt to mound for an 
error with two outs in the sixth. Audes De Leon followed with a 
two-run homer to right for Panama's first hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two baseball games in pool play amid  
rumors of impending defections, beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 as 
Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala 12-2 in a game stopped by 
the 10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the 
Canadians scored four runs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans today pushed through a $792  
billion tax cut package that sets up a clear ideological showdown 
with the White House over how best to make use of projected 
government budget surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said the  
Senate Finance Committee chairman, William Roth, R-Del., author of 
the 10-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said he would veto any measure that  
closely resembles the Senate bill or a similar House measure 
because the tax cuts are too large and endanger the nation's 
economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43.  
</P>
<P>
	More than one-third of the cut in the Senate bill would go to  
reducing the 15 percent bracket to 14 percent in 2001. That bracket 
would be expanded in 2005 to apply to taxable income of up to 
$47,050 on joint returns and $27,750 for single taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow married couples to file single returns on a combined form  
starting in 2005 as a way to deal with the so-called marriage 
penalty under which some couples pay more than they would if 
single. In 2001, the bill also would increase the standard 
deduction for married couples to $8,600. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Beginning in 2001, phase out inheritance tax rates that are in  
excess of 50 percent and increase the $1 million exemption to $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Raise the annual contribution limits to retirement accounts to  
$5,000 from the current $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The cornerstone of the House plan, which also totals $792  
billion, is a 10 percent across-the-board cut in tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before the final vote, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., met with 
their top deputies to discuss the timetable for negotiations to 
resolve differences between the two bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it.  
That's what the fighting is all about,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said the goal was to get the bill through the House and  
Senate by the end of next week, although it will probably be 
September, after the congressional August recess, before it is 
presented to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has stated repeatedly that he will veto the GOP plans on  
grounds they are too big, would take away money from needed 
spending for Social Security and other domestic programs and risk 
the nation's future economic stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate rejected numerous attempts to amend the bill today,  
but accepted a proposal by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and 
other GOP conservatives that would speed up measures to reduce tax 
disadvantages for married couples. Other tax breaks in the bill 
would be delayed to offset the $6 billion cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taxing the fundamental institution that we build values  
around,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton reminded Congress again Thursday that the bill faced a  
certain veto. In remarks before leaving for Europe, he said the 
``large and risky tax cut'' could carry America back ``to the dark 
old days of huge deficits.''

<P>
	Clinton has said he would accept no tax cut greater than $300  
billion and only if it came after the future of Social Security and 
Medicare was secured. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a veto threat but we've also got a responsibility to  
the American taxpayer,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a 
member of the Senate Finance Committee that crafted the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists have forecast that the budget surplus would total  
nearly $3 trillion over the next decade, but the fight was over 
what to do with the non-Social Security surplus of approximately $1 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Republicans said the bulk of that should be returned to  
taxpayers. Democrats said there was a real chance the forecasters 
were wrong, and that even if the surpluses were realized they 
should be used for debt reduction and needed spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bright-line test,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.  
``There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and 
what we fight for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Republicans, joined by six Democrats, rejected a  
Democratic alternative that would have limited the tax cut to $290 
billion. On Thursday, a $500 billion compromise bill that attracted 
moderates from both parties was withdrawn under pressure from party 
leaders. ``I don't think either of the two parties at this time is 
supportive'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who sponsored the 
alternative with Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	Also defeated was a proposal by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,  
that the bill be altered to include funds to provide prescription 
drug benefits to Medicare recipients. ``Our plan presents a clear 
choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and 
unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth promised action on the prescription drug issue in the fall,  
but ``we should not be pressured into simply accepting something 
that does require our most careful and studied attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the Republican side, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sought  
changes to make the bill more compatible with the House version. 
Gramm's amendment, defeated on a procedural vote, would have 
eventually reduced all income tax rates by 10 percent, repealed 
estate taxes and eliminated the marriage tax. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Texan Republican Hutchison said the across-the-board cut  
was ``the fairest of all tax cuts,'' but Democrats assailed it as 
unfairly benefiting wealthier taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the benefits would go to the 10 percent with  
the highest incomes, said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. ``It is a 
class warfare amendment and it should be trounced in a vote.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 percent tax rate cut included in the House bill was  
likely to be one of the major issues when the House and Senate meet 
to resolve differences.

<HEADLINE> Craft Crashes Moon in Water Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Lunar Prospector spacecraft was sent to a  
violent collision with the moon today, but powerful telescopes 
watching from the Earth failed to detect a dust cloud, a result 
that some called ``a bit of a disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of dust, however, does not mean that a search for  
evidence of water on the moon has failed, experts said. Telescopes, 
using ultraviolet filters, will continue to look for clues that 
water vapor was splashed into the lunar sky by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA engineers sent final instructions to Lunar Prospector just  
before it sped out of sight behind the moon early this morning. 
Rockets were set to fire automatically to crash the craft on the 
lunar surface at 5:52 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	David Folta, the guidance officer at the Goddard Space Flight  
Center in Greenbelt, Md., said that since Prospector's radio 
signals were not picked up again, the spacecraft must have hit the 
moon. The precise impact point, however, wasn't clear. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went normally,'' said Folta, ``so we have every  
reason to believe it made it to the impact site.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had the automatic rocket firing behind the moon not gone as  
planned, the spacecraft would have reappeared, still in orbit and 
sending radio signals. But Folta said, ``We never heard from it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldstein, a University of Texas scientist observing from  
the MacDonald Observatory in west Texas, said no dust cloud or 
other visible indication of impact was detected by telescopes 
focused on the lunar south pole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't see any evidence of the impact,'' said Goldstein.  
``We didn't see any dust. It is a bit of a disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein noted, ``we know it crashed. We just don't know where  
exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the MacDonald telescopes continue to take data, however,  
recording measurements in invisible ultraviolet light. The data 
will be analyzed in a search for the chemical signature of water, a 
process that may take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 354-pound spacecraft was to complete its highly successful  
voyage of discovery by smashing near the lunar south pole, into a 
shadowed crater that scientists believe may contain frozen water. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts calculated that the spacecraft -- hurtling at 3,800 mph --  
would explode against the moon with enough force to send a plume of 
dust and vapor spiraling into the lunar sky. Telescopes watching 
from Earth and orbit are to search that plume for evidence of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	It was hoped there might also be a visible plume or dust cloud  
from the impact, but there were no immediate reports of such 
sightings from about a half dozen observatory telescopes focused on 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and spent 18 months  
circling the moon. It completed more than 6,800 orbits, dipping to 
within 6.2 miles, as its five instruments analyzed the moon's 
chemistry, gravity and magnetic fields. Findings from one of the 
instruments led to the plan to crash the spacecraft into the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	In readings over the lunar poles, the instrument detected the  
chemical signature of hydrogen, a finding that to scientists 
suggests the presence of water. By some estimates, there could be 
as much as 200 million metric tons of water mixed in the top 18 
inches of lunar soil near the poles. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a fraction of that -- about 100 pounds -- may be vaporized by  
the spacecraft crash, experts believe. But that would be enough to 
prove the presence of water. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Goldstein who first developed the idea of testing for the  
presence of water by crashing the spent Lunar Prospector into a 
frozen crater. Project scientists quickly approved the proposal, 
but most admitted the chance of a total success was only about 10 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Folta said guiding the spacecraft to a precise impact in the  
crater was ``really a tricky maneuver,'' but it everything went on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan was for the spacecraft to fire rockets to slow down and  
start a speedy dive toward a crater. After coming in at a very low 
angle, it was to clear a half-mile-high rim by about one-half mile, 
then crash into the 2 1/2-mile-deep crater. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts calculated that the spacecraft's crash would release  
energy equal to that of crashing a two-ton car at more than 1,100 
miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Binder, the principal scientist for the Lunar Prospector  
mission, said the crash is a fitting end for the little spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has never failed us,'' he said. ``It got 10 times more data  
than was expected. It has flown perfectly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was to end today, and Binder said by crashing  
Prospector into the moon, ``we'll get one final bit of science out 
of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, he said, the crash will produce a plume  
containing about 100 pounds (12 1/2 gallons) of water -- ``about a 
bathtub full.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cloud is expected to last about 13 hours, but analyzing the  
data and drawing final conclusions may take up to three months, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Binder said chances of success are not strong, but the payoff  
would be big for science and exploration if lunar water is proven. 
</P>
<P>
	Water on the moon could be chemically broken down into oxygen  
and hydrogen to make fuel for rockets or for electrical generators. 
The oxygen also could supply an atmosphere for a lunar base. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is to one day set up a lunar base,'' Binder said, and  
water there would ``make it a lot cheaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein's idea was that, if frozen water is in the crater, the  
collision would vaporize the ice and create a vapor of water 
molecules. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunlight would quickly break down the water into hydrogen and  
hydroxyl, a chemical formed when ultraviolet radiation frees a 
hydrogen atom from water. 
</P>
<P>
	If the vapor cloud is dense enough, Goldstein said, sunlight  
will cause the hydroxyl molecules to be visible to powerful 
telescopes using ultraviolet radiation detectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash site will become the final resting place for Eugene  
Shoemaker, a U.S. Geological Survey astronomer who was one of the 
world's leading authorities on lunar impacts. After he died two 
years ago in a car crash, a lipstick-size metal container filled 
with his ashes was glued to one of Prospector's braces before the 
craft was launched.

<HEADLINE>  Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- An unidentified Canadian athlete  
failed a drug test at the Pan American Games, the host nation's 
Olympic committee confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Olympic Association would not say which sport was  
involved or when the doping infraction occurred. But the Pan 
American Sports Organization notified the COA that a Canadian 
athlete tested positive for a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	PASO's Medical Commission said it will render a decision Sunday  
on whether a doping infraction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first positive test at these games.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. baseball team moved one victory from a spot in the  
Sydney Olympics when it beat Panama 5-2. If it beats Mexico on 
Sunday -- the squad of minor leaguers already did that last Tuesday 
-- it earns a berth in the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	American tennis, softball and soccer players were very stingy,  
and the women's basketball team was anything but, leaving it to the 
men to salvage U.S. pride on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The medals race is a runaway, with the United States at 172 (69  
gold), followed by Canada with 102 (31 gold) and Cuba with 89 (33 
gold). 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was more dominating than 18-year-old tennis phenom  
Alexandra Stevenson, who routed Francine Harvey of Antiqua 6-0, 
6-0. It was her first double shutout since she was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, the first woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals as a  
qualifier, has lost two games in four sets. She has spent as much 
time concentrating on collecting pins as on her groundstrokes and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly looking for pins from other countries,'' said  
Stevenson, whose opponent asked for her autograph after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman in action was Lilia Osterloh, who defeated  
Joelle Schad of the Dominican Republic 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Mamiitt beat Simon Ebelyn of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 6-3, 6-4;  
Bob Bryan was a 6-1, 6-1 winner of Felix Insaurralde of Paraguay; 
and Paul Goldstein downed Jermaine Smith of Jamaica 7-5, 6-0 in 
men's play. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's world champions in softball got their third straight  
shutout as they beat the Netherlands Antilles 7-0 behind the 
three-hit pitching of Lori Harrigan. In the three games, the 
Americans have outscored their opponents 21-0, allowing only four 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a left-hander, walked only one and struck out nine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime your pitchers go out and don't allow any runs, you  
have to be happy with their performance,'' coach Ralph Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Douty led an 11-hit U.S. attack with two hits and two  
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men were just as strong, winning over the Dominican  
Republic 12-0 in six innings. Doug Middleton struck out 16 of 18 
batters and allowed only one hit. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3-0 victory over Canada gave the U.S. women's soccer squad an  
18-1 scoring edge in the preliminary round and first place in its 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team totally stepped up,'' Marcia Wallis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 0-0 tie with weak Uruguay, the American men's soccer  
team also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of those strong victories came a poor performance  
from the women's basketball squad, which sustained its worst Pan 
Ams loss ever, 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban women overwhelmed the United States with quickness,  
slashing drives to the basket and a trapping zone defense. They 
jumped to a 14-3 lead in the first five minutes and the Americans 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good, but we know we're a lot better defensive team  
than that,'' forward Lynn Pride said. ``We had a lot of breakdowns. 
We usually rely on our help, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No such problems for the U.S. men's squad of CBA all-stars.  
Sparked by the shot-swatting defense of 7-foot Mikki Moore, they 
rolled past Cuba 89-48 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Thomas led the Americans with 17 points. Moore contributed  
seven points, five rebounds and three blocks and generally 
intimidated any Cuban who thought of shooting near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, I had some jitters early,'' Moore said. ``I  
got a few blocks and that got my blood flowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won three out of five boxing matches.  
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Gerald Tucker, light heavyweight Joe Pastorello and  
light welterweight Corey Bernard easily moved into the second round 
with lopsided victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, romped to a 24-4 win over Cesar Morales  
of Mexico. Pastorello of Colorado Springs, Colo., was an 11-2 
winner against Francisco Garcia of the Dominican. The referee 
stopped Bernard's bout against round Elkena Saunders of the Bahamas 
in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker forced a standing-8 count in the first round and then  
eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many butterflies before this bout, and then to top  
things off I was the first bout,'' he said. ``I just felt I had to 
continue what was started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won their first two bouts on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The losing U.S. fighters were Ron Siler of Cincinnati, beaten by  
Cuba's Maikros Romero in light flyweight, and lightweight Jason 
Ingwaldson of Henderson, Nev.,who was stopped in the second round 
by Fabricio Nieva of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	John Patterson pitched 5 2-3 hitless innings Saturday night and  
allowed two hits in eight innings. The 6-foot-5 Patterson, a 
Double-A pitcher in the Arizona Diamondbacks' organization, had not 
given up a hit when he fumbled Earl Agnoly's bunt to mound for an 
error with two outs in the sixth. Audes De Leon followed with a 
two-run homer to right for Panama's first hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two baseball games in pool play amid  
rumors of impending defections, beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 as 
Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala 12-2 in a game stopped by 
the 10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the 
Canadians scored four runs.

<HEADLINE> 1,010 Gypsies Seek Refuge in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARI, Italy (AP) -- More than 1,000 illegal immigrants in an old  
tugboat landed in southern Italy on Saturday under Italian military 
escort, the biggest single arrival in a weeks-long influx of 
Gypsies from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said 489 of the 1,010 aboard were children. The  
would-be refugees burst into applause when they docked at the 
southern port of Bari. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Gypsies have landed illegally in Italy since the  
war in Kosovo ended, with many saying they were fleeing revenge 
attacks by ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Albanians are hunting us,'' one man, identified only as  
Ekrep, was quoted as telling Italy's ANSA news agency. ``We have 
nothing, we have no homes, we have nothing to eat, and above all, 
we're afraid. Afraid of being killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy declared in mid-July it would treat the Gypsies as illegal  
immigrants rather than refugees, and return them immediately. But 
most have been taken to reception centers, which are often just 
first stops en route to points elsewhere in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The new arrivals had left Friday from the coast of Montenegro,  
Serbia's smaller partner in the Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Once docked, the passengers were taken for medical examination  
and for identification and then on to reception centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities took into custody two men from Romania suspected of  
being immigrant traffickers.

<HEADLINE> Umpires Warned Against Harassment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Baseball warned the bickering umpires not to harass each other  
as the infighting over their failed mass resignation plan got 
nastier and more emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	The wife of a union supporter sent an angry letter to another  
umpire's wife saying her husband was a ``Judas'' for betraying his 
fellow umps. And one of the game's most respected umpires broke 
down in tears as he was interviewed on television before Saturday's 
``Game of the Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to give up my job of 25 years and sit down,''  
said Richie Garcia, one of the 22 umpires whose resignations were 
accepted, effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to let people that have been in baseball 15  
years or 10 years or five years or three years take my job. I love 
this game,'' Garcia said on Fox's broadcast, wiping tears from his 
eyes and cutting the interview short. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the umpires who support union head Richie Phillips are  
angry with the 13 who refused to resign and the 14 who withdrew 
their resignations before last Tuesday. The union hoped the threat 
of a mass walkout would force baseball to immediately negotiate a 
labor contract to replace the one that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman sent a memo  
to umpires warning them of possible discipline. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have received several reports suggesting that umpires may  
have been involved in illegal threats, intimidation or harassment 
of other umpires who may have a different point of view regarding 
the issues raised by the illegal mass resignation plan instigated 
by the Major League Umpires' Association,' said the memo, dated 
July 29. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be absolutely clear with you on one point -- we will  
not tolerate any threats, intimidation or harassment against any 
umpire. Anyone who is found to have engaged in such conduct will be 
disciplined immediately. Every umpire is entitled to have his own 
view on these issues but we will not allow any umpire to be 
threatened, intimidated or harassed because of his point of view.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A letter from Marcia Montague, wife of NL ump Ed Montague, to  
Denise Hirschbeck, wife of AL ump John Hirschbeck, was an example 
of the kind of anger and emotion that has split the union. 
Phillips' supporters blame Hirschbeck and AL ump Joe Brinkman for 
organizing the opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must be very proud of your husband for undermining 20  
years of work from an association that has reaped him so many 
benefits,'' wrote Mrs. Montague, whose husband still has his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame because it would have been a good fight against  
what's wrong in baseball. Maybe we all could have made a difference 
in the fight to restore real leadership to the game. I would have 
liked to see us take on the MLB, the commissioner and the media. 
For promoting the myths that umpires are arrogant, when they are 
actually proud; that they are not accountable, when they always 
have been, to the leagues and to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we didn't see the Judas in our midst, who sold us out for  
20 pieces of gold. I guess you'll have to live with that. And John, 
every time he walks out on that field. And your kids, when you 
teach them about ethics and morals. And all the other umpires and 
their wives and children who followed John because they believed in 
... what? ... 
</P>
<P>
	``John is an embarrassment to all real umpires and baseball  
because he forgot the quintessential -- baseball is a team sport, 
and he thinks he is bigger than the team. He shamed us all. I can 
say my husband was good for the game -- can you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hirschbeck did not respond to a telephone message left at his  
home in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read the letter and I cried,'' Phillips said. ``I cried and  
I don't cry very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split of Phillips' supporters and backers has disrupted  
umpires' families, friendship and working relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Reilly, one of the other umpires' on Garcia's crew, opposes  
the union leadership; the two others, Laz Diaz and Brian O'Nora, 
are among 25 umpires hired from the minor leagues who will become 
permanent replacements on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got three guys that he practically raised that clinged to  
him, like babies to a mother,'' Phillips said. ``Now he doesn't go 
to the ballpark with them, he doesn't eat with them. He considers 
them scabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Phillips, an AL ump in his 29th season, said he didn't  
fault umpires in the other faction but blamed the leadership for a 
negotiating stance that backfired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richie Phillips has got to resign and go away because he's  
hurt the Major League Umpires Association so much,'' said Dave 
Phillips, who is not related to the union leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``I adamantly and strongly disagree with every bone in my body  
with the direction this leadership advised my union members to 
follow,'' Dave Phillips said. ``Richie Phillips led him into this 
kind of situation. This is like the Jonestown, Koolaid thing. Not 
everybody was going to be that stupid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there had been threats, Brinkman said:  
</P>
<P>
	``Just a couple of things said in the dressing room, nothing  
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And commenting on Garcia's emotional TV appearance, he said:  
</P>
<P>
	``Richie's got to be hurt, I feel as bad for them as they do  
themselves, these are my friends, but they were just ill advised. I 
know how he feels, I know what he is going through, and I hope 
somehow somebody takes mercy on them.''

<HEADLINE> Sears To Cut 680 Jobs by October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOFFMAN ESTATES, Ill. (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. will trim  
about 680 jobs from its corporate headquarters by the end of 
October, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will affect 10 percent of the company's headquarters  
staff in addition to hundreds of independent contractors who will 
be let go by Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``By year-end, we will have a leaner organization,'' said Sears  
spokesman Ron Culp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears has been under increasing market pressure from  
lower-priced competitors, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's same-store sales have increased only 1 percent to  
2 percent during each of the past several months and second-quarter 
profits fell 1.5 percent to $331 million, Sears reported last week.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans pushed their $792 billion tax cut  
through the Senate on Friday, courting a classic veto struggle this 
fall with President Clinton and Democrats who claim the measure 
shortchanges Medicare and other domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 57-43 -- largely along party lines -- in favor of the  
GOP plan. The 10-year measure includes broad-based tax relief as 
well as provisions designed to address the so-called marriage 
penalty and make it easier to accumulate retirement savings and pay 
for education. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage was followed by the beginning of efforts at forging a  
quick House-Senate compromise. Congressional GOP leaders hope to 
speed the final measure through both houses next week, although it 
won't be sent to Clinton until after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	That would leave time for the GOP rank and file to trumpet the  
benefits of tax cuts during Congress' long August break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to cut taxes and the president wants to spend it,''  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said of projected 
federal surpluses. ``That's what this fighting is all about. We are 
determined to give working Americans the tax relief they are 
entitled to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wasted little time renewing his oft-stated veto threat.  
``The Republican tax cut is so large it would undo our fiscal 
discipline and imperil our prosperity,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``It would crowd out our commitments to pay down the 
debt, to save Social Security and to strengthen and modernize 
Medicare with a long overdue prescription drug benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure includes a reduction from 15 percent to 14  
percent in the lowest personal income tax bracket, effective in 
2001. Beginning in 2006, it would gradually shift some income 
currently taxed at 28 percent into that lower bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes provisions to reduce the marriage penalty, in  
part by slowly raising the standard deduction for married couples 
to double the amount allowed for individuals. Individuals currently 
may claim $4,300, and couples $7,200. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before final passage, the measure was amended to let  
investors exclude from taxes the first $1,000 in long-term capital 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, more students would be allowed to deduct the  
interest on their education loans; limits on deductible 
contributions to individual retirement accounts would rise 
gradually to $5,000, and there would be liberalized tax incentives 
for individual and corporate donors to charities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would create a new deduction for the cost of  
long-term care insurance, and raise the estate tax exemption -- 
already scheduled to increase to $1 million -- up to $1.5 million in 
2007. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout three days of debate on the Senate floor, Republicans  
said their budget would set aside the vast bulk of projected 
surpluses for Social Security. The tax cuts, they stressed, would 
consume less than 24 cents of each dollar of predicted surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps the family and it helps the country,'' said Sen.  
William V. Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee and 
architect of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democrats and the president contended the GOP bill would dip  
into Social Security surpluses beginning in 2005, and leave little 
or nothing for other domestic programs. They also said that by 
providing tax cuts based on economic forecasts that might not 
materialize, the Republicans were risking a return to the days of 
large federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another riverboat gamble with the American economy,''  
said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in an echo of the rhetoric used in 
the early 1980s when Republicans cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats countered with a smaller tax cut of $290 billion,  
which was rejected earlier in the week. Efforts to fashion a 
bipartisan compromise at $500 billion collapsed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A final compromise is still a possibility at year's end, but the  
immediate prospect is for a veto confrontation driven by competing 
readings of the electorate's wishes 15 months before the next 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, who called their measure the Taxpayer Refund Act of  
1999, hope they can force Clinton to bend to their wishes on tax 
cuts, and say the president and other Democrats will pay a 
political price otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, believe they can frame the debate as a  
choice between risky, overlarge tax cuts on one side, and the fate 
of Medicare and other politically popular programs on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the three days of floor debate, both sides sought to  
shore up potential weaknesses in their position. For their part, 
Republicans parried Democratic claims about Medicare by pledging to 
address the issue of prescription drugs this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats abandoned Clinton's initial approach of targeted tax  
relief in favor of broad-based tax cuts, although on a far smaller 
scale than the GOP wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on the 2000 elections, when eight first-term  
Republican senators will seek new terms, Democrats forced a series 
of politically charged votes, including one on a proposal to reduce 
the tax cut to make room for prescription drug benefits for 
Medicare recipients. The amendment failed. 
</P>
<P>
	On final passage, the bill was supported by 52 Republicans, Sen.  
Bob Smith, I-N.H., and Democrats Mary Landrieu and John Breaux of 
Louisiana, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Robert Torricelli of New 
Jersey. In opposition, there were 43 Democrats and two Republicans, 
George Voinovich of Ohio and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., outlined an ambitious schedule that calls for a compromise 
by Tuesday, with final votes in the two chambers by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous differences between the bills. One is a  
House-passed provision that calls for a 10 percent across-the-board 
income tax cut rather than the reduced income tax bracket the 
Senate approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott told reporters ``there's a lot of support'' among Senate  
Republicans for an across-the-board cut, adding, ``That is the 
fairest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will fall to Lott and Hastert to prod the chairmen of the  
tax-writing committees, Roth and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, to 
avoid prolonged haggling that would slow the broader GOP political 
strategy.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- American boxers, tennis and softball  
players were very stingy Saturday at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Gerald Tucker and light heavyweight Joe Pastorello  
easily moved into the second round with lopsided victories. And the 
women's world champions in softball got their third straight 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
	But nobody was more dominating than 18-year-old tennis phenom  
Alexandra Stevenson, who routed Francine Harvey of Antiqua 6-0, 
6-0. It was her first double shutout since she was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, the first woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals as a  
qualifier, has lost two games in four sets. She has spent as much 
time concentrating on collecting pins as on her groundstrokes and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly looking for pins from other countries,'' said  
Stevenson, whose opponent asked for her autograph after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman in action was Lilia Osterloh, who defeated  
Joelle Schad of the Dominican Republic 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Mamiitt beat Simon Ebelyn of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 6-3, 6-4  
and Bob Bryan was a 6-1, 6-1 winner of Felix Insaurralde of 
Paraguay in men's play. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Saturday, the U.S. baseball team played Panama in the  
quarterfinals. Earlier, Canada and Cuba both advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's and women's basketball squads also played their second  
games of the preliminary round Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's softball team beat the Netherlands Antilles 7-0  
behind the three-hit pitching of Lori Harrigan. In the three games, 
the Americans have outscored their opponents 21-0, allowing only 
four hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a left-hander, walked only one and struck out nine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime your pitchers go out and don't allow any runs, you  
have to be happy with their performance,'' coach Ralph Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Douty led an 11-hit U.S. attack with two hits and two  
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, romped to a 24-4 win over Cesar Morales  
of Mexico. Pastorello of Colorado Springs, Colo., was an 11-2 
winner against Francisco Garcia of the Dominican. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker forced a standing-8 count in the first round and then  
eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many butterflies before this bout, and then to top  
things off I was the first bout,'' he said. ``I just felt I had to 
continue what was started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won their first two bouts on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two baseball games in pool play amid  
rumors of impending defections, beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 as 
Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala 12-2 in a game stopped by 
the 10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the 
Canadians scored four runs.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Proposes 30 Percent Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODSVILLE, N.H. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle  
proposed 30 percent tax cuts and flexible tax-free savings accounts 
Saturday, saying dramatic tax reductions are needed to strengthen 
American families. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American family is overtaxed, and this rate reduction will  
enable parents to keep more of their paycheck, which just might be 
the difference that allows more time with the children, rather than 
more time working,'' he said at a reception in Orford. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in Woodsville, the Republican presidential hopeful met  
with voters at a restaurant and discussed goals: 
</P>
<P>
	--Strengthening family values. ``I am back on my feet fighting  
for you and your families, and I am not going to back down,'' 
Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Voluntary term limits in Congress. He said that once elected,  
lawmakers get closer to lobbyists and to Washington, at the expense 
of their constituents. To discourage career politicians, Quayle 
said he would favor cutting free health care and additional 
retirement benefits for lawmakers serving more than 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enforcing gun laws. ``That will do a lot to deter gun  
violence,'' he said.

	NOVI, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan Democrats voted Saturday to hold  
their presidential caucus March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	They rejected a plea by U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., to defy  
the national committee and break Iowa and New Hampshire's pride of 
place in the presidential selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin asked about 250 members at the Democratic State Central  
Committee meeting to hold the 2000 caucuses on Feb. 12. National 
party rules ban states other than New Hampshire and Iowa from 
holding their primaries and caucuses before March 6, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's party caucuses are expected to be Feb. 7, with the New  
Hampshire primary about a week later. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should two small states, unrepresentative in their  
character of the American people, determine how the politics of 
this country should be played every four years?'' asked Burke Webb, 
chairman of the Cass County Democrats, speaking in support of 
Levin's cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Democrats asked the national committee for a waiver  
from the March 6 rule but were turned down. If the State Central 
Committee had ignored the rejection, the decision would have 
sacrificed Michigan's seats at the 2000 national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is only one way to win this fight,'' Levin said, ``and  
that is if some state or states have the courage to pick their 
delegates in a way that allows that state to compete ..., and if 
penalized to take that fight to the national convention.''

	Gov. Frank O'Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Modisett and U.S.  
Rep. Julia Carson were among those who endorsed Vice President Al

<P>
	``We appreciate the endorsements of all these elected  
officials,'' said Mrs. Gore. ``Thank you for placing trust in him, 
for being behind him in his quest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 150 cheering, flag-waving supporters, O'Bannon  
said: ``I enthusiastically support Al Gore for the next president 
of the United States.''

	ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton took her summer-long  
New York ``listening tour'' to an agricultural seminar at Cornell 
University on Saturday and heard upstate farmers' worries. 
</P>
<P>
	Their list was varied: low milk prices, high inheritance taxes,  
subsidized foreign competition, tough rules on manure storage, 
genetic engineering of crops. And the drought. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do eight acres, and it's iffy now how many of those acres  
will make it this year because of the drought,'' Carol Stull, an 
organic vegetable farmer, told the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the farmers spoke not only about current uncertainties  
but of the future and whether their children would be able to 
follow them into a business where financial risks are growing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally, you're not getting sufficient returns to justify  
investing in that business,'' said Mary Beth Holub, a Cornell 
graduate and dairy farmer with 75 cows.

<HEADLINE> Businesswomen Give Dole a Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For her 63rd birthday, Elizabeth Dole scooped  
up $200,000 courtesy of a small army of businesswomen angry that 
one of their own -- and the first to seek the presidency -- was not 
faring better in a field of men. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're keeping her in the running,'' declared Bonnie McElveen  
Hunter, the newly political entrepreneur now in charge of building 
Dole's $2 million bankroll. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a Wall Street Journal article late in the winter that  
ticked off Mrs. Hunter just enough to reach for her checkbook for 
the first time in any political race. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was Elizabeth Dole dead last behind someone named Gary  
Bauer,'' Mrs. Hunter recalled about the story ranking the 
presidential candidates' fund-raising fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought to myself, how could a woman who's dedicated her  
life to public service and turned around the Red Cross be behind 
someone I'd never even heard of?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was in the year's first three months, when Dole, despite a  
heady lead in some polls, drew just $700,000 in contributions. By 
July, she raised $3.5 million and socked $1.8 million in the bank -- 
compared with the $30 million Texas Gov. George W. Bush has on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	New York fashion designer Jhane Barnes -- who has not voted since  
her parents pushed her to the polls for Richard Nixon and no longer 
is even registered -- was angered into helping Dole when one of the 
30-year-old women in her studio said the country is not ready for a 
woman president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was dead in my tracks. How could one of MY employees say  
that to ME? It made me mad,'' Barnes said. ``You create your own 
reality and I want to believe it's possible to be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where New Hampshire horserace polls once showed Dole ahead of  
Bush, she now pulls well under 20 percent of the vote in surveys, 
compared with Bush's 40 percent or better. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington lobbyist and Dole fund-raiser Wayne Valis said  
winning has taken a back burner to getting heard. His pitch to 
would-be donors: ``Give Elizabeth a chance, let her make her 
case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether she is the most nominate-able, we'll see. But we'll  
only see if she has the resources to stay in the race,'' Valis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole owes to women whatever gains she's made and political  
strategists say she must pin her hopes to women as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, whose support for gun control and dismissal of a  
constitutional amendment banning abortion appears aimed at women, 
wins twice as many women as men in polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's high on the wishful-thinking scale that anyone can catch  
up to Bush,'' said pollster Lee Miringoff of the Marist Institute 
for Public Opinion. ``But there is leverage for her being the only 
woman candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, among homestate contributors in North Carolina for her  
63rd birthday on Thursday, bristled at any notion that her gender 
was her greatest appeal. ``I'm not running because I'm a woman, and 
I don't want people to vote for me because I am a woman,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her campaign slogan, however, is a wink to the fact that the  
United States has not yet had a woman president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's make history!'' cry her banners and pamphlets.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first half of this year, women gave Dole 43 percent of  
her big donations, compared with the 25 percent women contribute in 
a typical political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, three dozen female executives from around the country  
signed up to raise $10,000 apiece or more. 
</P>
<P>
	One of them, Janey Moores, president of BJM &AMP; Associates in  
Lexington, Ky., said she is tapping fellow professional women -- no 
men yet, not even her husband -- on Dole's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hear from some, 'She will do us proud' and 'Let's get a  
woman in there,''' Moores said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though each of the half-dozen Dole fund raisers interviewed  
professed to like Bush, all expressed an indignance that Dole, a 
two-time Cabinet secretary and former president of the American Red 
Cross, is running so far behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she has not earned a place in upper, upper leadership in  
this country, I don't know who has -- male or female,'' Moores said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women have never had an opportunity such as we have with  
Elizabeth Dole,'' said Nancy Donovan, owner of Cincinnati's Ames 
Travel Service with $20 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty exciting to me to think we can have a woman  
running our country who understands what it means to be a woman in 
the workplace.'' Donovan called first reports last month of Bush's 
cash pile ``a downer'' to her fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	But McElveen-Hunter, in a North Carolina drawl rivaling Dole's,  
makes a special pitch to friends who already gave to Bush: ``I've 
never seen a pair of pants with one pocket.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP President Not Upset by Prank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- As the president of the Cleveland NAACP looked  
on, Indians owner Richard Jacobs donned a makeshift white hood and 
made fun of an upcoming Ku Klux Klan rally. 
</P>
<P>
	George L. Forbes, president of the Cleveland chapter of the  
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he 
was not offended by Jacobs' prank, which took place as Jacobs was 
flying a group to the July 13 All-Star Game in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes has been publicly feuding with Mayor Michael R. White  
over the city's plans for a KKK rally in the city scheduled for 
Aug. 21. And as the plane headed for Boston, Jacobs put on the 
white hood as a joke, The Plain Dealer reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came a third of the way down the plane. He didn't say  
anything. People seemed amused,'' said Plain Dealer editorial page 
director Brent Larkin, who was also on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said Jacobs was carrying a sign that said, ``How do we  
get to the Justice Center?'' -- the planned location for the KKK 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone put it into the context that this was  
something between two people who are very close to one another,'' 
Larkin said. ``As far as I know, everybody got a kick out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said Jacobs invited him on the trip as a brief escape  
from the controversy over the rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no offense meant. There was no offense taken,''  
Forbes said of Jacobs' actions. ``It was not offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said Forbes and Cleveland Cavaliers President Wayne Embry  
were the only blacks on the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who announced he was putting the Indians up for sale in  
May, was not available for comment Saturday. Neither Bob DiBiasio, 
Indians vice president of public relations, nor Dennis Lehman, the 
team's executive vice president of business, had a phone number for 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were unaware of the incident. The organization has no  
comment,'' DiBiasio told The Associated Press Saturday at Jacobs 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Jacobs' company, the Richard E. Jacobs Group,  
settled out of court with two businessmen who claimed their kiosk 
at a Columbus mall owned by the company was evicted because it 
attracted too many black customers.

<HEADLINE>  Brett Honored Again in Kansas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- George Brett, appearing weary but  
gracious after a week of Hall of Fame hoopla, was feted Saturday in 
a midtown parade that drew thousands of fans to the city's center. 
</P>
<P>
	Following marching bands, clowns, and classic cars carrying  
several of his former teammates, Brett poked out from the roof of a 
royal blue stretch limousine and waved to fans along streets near 
the Country Club Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Joined on a grandstand by his family, several former Kansas City  
Royals teammates and manager Whitey Herzog, Brett repeatedly 
thanked the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities capped a momentous week for Brett, which started  
with his July 25 induction into the Hall of Fame at Cooperstown,

<HEADLINE> Deals Shape Up As Deadline Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kevin Appier, Billy Taylor and Jim Leyritz switched teams while  
Chuck Finley stayed put Saturday as the baseball trading deadline 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Guzman, Terry Mulholland and Shawon Dunston also got dealt  
in a flurry in the final minutes before the midnight EDT deadline. 
There were nine deals overall, including three by the New York 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	The busy Oakland Athletics shuffled their staff, bracing for a  
wild-card run. They got Appier from the Kansas City Royals and also 
sent Taylor to the New York Mets for Jason Isringhausen and Greg 
McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in a step-on-the-gas mode,'' Appier said. ``They think  
they've got a good thing going and they're trying to improve their 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets, meanwhile, made two other trades.  
</P>
<P>
	In a five-player swap with Colorado, the Mets obtained  
outfielder Darryl Hamilton and reliever Chuck McElroy for 
outfielder Brian McRae and two minor leaguers. Later, the Mets got 
infielder Shawon Dunston from St. Louis for minor leaguer Craig 
Paquette. 
</P>
<P>
	Also moving to New York -- again -- was Leyritz. The Yankees  
reacquired the postseason hero from the San Diego Padres for a 
minor league pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	A half-hour before the deadline, the Cincinnati Reds bolstered  
their rotation by getting Guzman from the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the Chicago Cubs traded Mulholland and infielder Jose  
Hernandez to Atlanta for minor league pitcher Micah Bowie, another 
minor leaguer and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in one last deal, Boston picked up pitcher Bryce Florie  
from Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades can still be made after the deadline, but players must  
first pass through waivers. That means any club can step in and 
block a potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no deal for Finley. Though the Yankees showed  
interest, the Cleveland Indians were believed to have pursued the 
Anaheim ace the most. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chuck Finley is still on the Angels,'' general manager Bill  
Bavasi said. ``We did not shop around, it came down to one club. We 
gave them a group of players we would take and it stayed there. 
They called and said they did not accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees Andy Pettitte, Tampa Bay's Roberto Hernandez,  
Rolando Arrojo and Fred McGriff, and Baltimore's Arthur Rhodes and 
Will Clark also stayed put. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, 31, had been rumored in possible deals since spring  
training. The right-hander was 9-9 with a 4.87 ERA, and 114-89 in a 
career that began with the Royals in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad, but I'm not saying that I hate Kansas City or the  
fans,'' Appier said. ``I'm going to miss them and it's not like I'm 
going to leave the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland traded three young pitchers for Appier: Blake Stein,  
Jeff D'Amico and Brad Rigby. The Athletics, 3 1/2 games behind Toronto 
in the wild-card race, also sent away the 37-year-old Taylor, who 
has 26 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate Kevin's long and loyal service,'' Royals general  
manager Herk Robinson said. ``However, the Royals organization has 
made a commitment to reducing payroll and taking advantage of 
signing the numerous picks we had in this June's amateur draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics recently traded pitcher Kenny Rogers to the Mets  
and also got pitcher Omar Olivares and infielder Randy Velarde from 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we made all these deals, we had a grand plan in mind,''  
Athletics general manager Billy Beane said. ``One had to fall in 
order for the other to fall. This is a big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to add to the present and future with every deal we  
did. Kevin has been a No. 1 and he brings a No. 1 mentality. 
There's a lot of value in that,'' he said. ``We weren't supposed to 
be here in July. Now we're trying to make our mark in this race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There had been talk the AL East-leading Yankees would send  
Pettitte to Philadelphia, but manager Joe Torre said before 
Saturday's game at Boston, ``I don't think it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the Yankees completed a deal for Leyritz.  
</P>
<P>
	``They could have traded me anywhere, but it shows the class of  
this organization to give me another opportunity back in New 
York,'' Leyritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in New York for as many years as I did, it's almost  
like being in the World Series every day. I thrived on it while I 
was there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz, 35, is hitting .239 with eight home runs and 21 RBIs.  
He can play first base or DH, and was Pettitte's personal catcher 
with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres got minor league pitcher Geraldo Padua for Leyritz.  
The 22-year-old righty was 9-4 with a 2.86 ERA for Class A 
Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado and the Mets swapped center fielders and left-handed  
relievers. The Rockies also got pitcher Rigo Beltran and minor 
league outfielder Thomas Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 34, was batting .303 with four homers and 24 RBIs.  
McElroy, 31, was 3-1 with a 6.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little surprised, but a little relieved that it's  
over,'' Hamilton said. ``I gained about 25 games in a five-minute 
phone call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McRae, 31, has been a disappointment with the Mets, batting .221  
with eight homers and 36 RBIs. Beltran, 29, was optioned to 
Triple-A Norfolk July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``Darryl's hitting over .300 right now and we think he's going  
to improve us offensively and defensively,'' Mets general manager 
Steve Phillips said. ``Unfortunately, Brian couldn't get anything 
going this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guzman, 32, was 5-9 with a 4.18 ERA. The Orioles sent him and  
cash to the Reds for minor league pitchers B.J. Ryan and Jacobo 
Sequea. Last July 31, Baltimore got Guzman from Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a swap of 25-year-old minor league pitchers, the Florida  
Marlins sent Brandon Villafuerte to the Detroit Tigers for Mike 
Drumright.

<HEADLINE>  US, Mexico Baseball Teams Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It comes down to beating Mexico for a  
spot in the Sydney Olympics for the U.S. baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	John Patterson pitched 5 2-3 hitless innings Saturday night and  
the United States advanced to the Pan American Games semifinals by 
beating Panama 5-2, leaving the Americans one victory away from 
clinching a trip to the 2000 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will meet Mexico on Sunday for a trip to  
Sydney. Mexico tripped Nicaragua 5-1 Saturday, joining Canada and 
Cuba in the semifinals. The Americans beat Mexico 5-1 in the 
prelimnaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The gold medal game is Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Patterson, a Double-A pitcher in the Arizona  
Diamondbacks' organization, had not given up a hit when he fumbled 
Earl Agnoly's bunt to mound for an error with two outs in the 
sixth. Audes De Leon followed with a two-run homer to right for 
Panama's first hit. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed two hits in eight innings.  
</P>
<P>
	The United States scored four times in the third, capped by Jon  
Zuber's two-run double. Craig Paquette homerd to make it 5-0 in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Canada stayed unbeaten and set up an emotional semifinal  
rematch with Cuba, routing Guatemala 12-2 behind four homers and 
the pitching of Yan LaChapelle. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of Sunday's semifinal between the Canadians and the  
world champion Cubans also qualifies for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two games in pool play amid rumors of  
impending defections, advanced Saturday by beating the Dominican 
Republic 3-1 as Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban reliever Luis Lazo pitched out of a bases loaded jam in  
the seventh to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody can win the tournament now,'' Dominican manager Felix  
Fermin said. ``We had confidence we could go farther, but that's 
baseball. Cuba just played better than us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala in a game stopped by the 
10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the Canadians 
scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, with five straight wins, beat Cuba won 8-1 in the  
opening round-robin series, a rough game that featured two home 
plate collisions between Canada's Aaron Guiel and Cuban catcher 
Ariel Pestano and brought both teams to the top of their dugouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can play with anyone and we know we can beat Cuba,'' said  
Radmanovich, who played in the major leagues with Seattle in 1998 
and is now at Triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really wanted to play Cuba rather than the Dominican. ...  
It's een fun having all these guys come from different teams to 
represent their country. Tomorrow will be the biggest game of my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaChapelle survived a bases-loaded situation in the second,  
giving up just one one run. Ware hit a two-run homer in the third 
and three batters later, Radmanovich connected for a three-run shot 
to make it 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Gutierrez homered for Guatemala in the sixth.

<HEADLINE> Resendiz Charged in 2 More Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The Mexican drifter suspected of killing nine  
people in three states has been indicted on two more capital murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Indictments returned Friday allege that Angel Maturino Resendiz  
bludgeoned the Rev. Norman ``Skip'' Sirnic and his wife Karen, both 
47. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sirnics were killed as they slept inside their parsonage in  
Weimar about 80 miles west of Houston. Their bodies were discovered 
May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz already faced five charges that carry possible  
death sentences: two in Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know that one death sentence is enough,'' said  
prosecutor Joe Fling. ``They all go up on automatic appeal, and 
they probably get overturned more than any other kind of sentence. 
There's something to be said for multiple sentences from multiple 
jurisdictions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A month after the Sirnics' bodies were discovered, the community  
was terrorized again by the similar killing of Josephine Konvicka, 
73. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, awaiting trial in the beating and stabbing  
death of 39-year-old Dr. Claudia Benton in the Houston area, also 
is suspected of killing Ms. Konvicka. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Allen Tanner said he was unaware the grand jury  
was considering the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's interesting that they're doing this now,'' Tanner  
said. When asked to elaborate, he replied, ``It's just 
interesting.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Death Toll Climbs to 93 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Guzzling down bottled water under the searing  
midday sun, police Officer Mike Sanders began his shift Friday 
checking to see how senior citizens were faring in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Knocking on the door of one high-rise apartment, he got no  
answer. Inside, he found 81-year-old Mary Powls lying on the floor 
of her sweltering home. Her windows were closed, and she had no 
fans or air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	The groggy woman said she had fallen and couldn't get help.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing that we came around when we did,'' Sanders  
said. He later checked on her in the hospital, where she was 
admitted in stable condition with a 104-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	As an unrelenting heat wave kept its grip on much of the nation  
-- from the Plains to the East Coast -- Chicago officials deployed 
hundreds of workers on the streets to avoid a repeat of 1995, when 
scorching summer heat was blamed for more than 700 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The current heat wave has been linked to at least 94 deaths in  
18 states across the country since July 19. The Midwest has been 
hit hardest, with Missouri logging 29 heat-related deaths, Illinois 
23 and Ohio 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures neared 100 degrees in many cities, and the heat  
index -- a measure of temperature and humidity -- rose past 110 in 
several places. The heat index neared 120 in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The temperature was 103 at Chicago's Midway Airport, and by  
midday it was 99 in Kansas City, Mo. -- the 15th straight day that 
state had seen temperatures in the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	The misery was spread all over. It was 106 in Louisville, Ky.,  
one degree short of the city's record, and 104 in Fort Knox. 
Kenosha, Wis., reached 102, and Winona, Minn., reported a high of 
99. Nashville, Tenn., broke a record at 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Little Rock, Ark., registered 102. It's been so bad in central  
Arkansas that Danny Mahan, safety director for a construction 
company there, said workers pouring concrete have been arriving at 
work at about 3 a.m. to avoid laboring in the afternoon heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago had no formal heat emergency plan until the death tolls  
started mounting during the 1995 heat wave, when temperatures 
soared as high as 106 degrees, with humidity that made it feel like 
125. 
</P>
<P>
	The city issued an extreme heat warning Friday, sending workers  
door-to-door checking on senior citizens and urging people to take 
advantage of 30 air-conditioned cooling centers. Officials hired 
extra ambulances and sternly warned people to stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there was ever a day that hot weather threatened the lives  
of people in Chicago, it is today,'' said Fire Commissioner Edward 
Altman, who has been coordinating the city's heat relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wrigley Field, ushers sprayed water onto Chicago Cubs  
baseball fans in the bleachers and two players had to leave the 
game because of the heat. Across town, Jimmy Connors also was 
forced to withdraw from a seniors tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	But by late Friday, a glimmer of relief appeared in the form a  
Canada cool front moving into Minnesota and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Farm Economy Not All Gloom and Doom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The problems in the agricultural economy would  
seem far removed from John E. Miller's farm in the Arkansas Ozarks. 
Miller is turning out chickens as fast as his buyer, Conagra Inc., 
can take them -- probably 2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a stable business, the chicken business. ... The demand  
has been strong,'' Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is not alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat and other field crops have  
slumped to lows not seen by farmers in years. But government 
subsidies have softened the impact and much of the agricultural 
economy is relatively healthy, nowhere close to its perilous state 
during the farm crisis of the early 1980s, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	In its latest economic forecast, the Agriculture Department  
projects net farm income to dip to $43.8 billion this year, down 
slightly from last year and off 3.7 percent of the 
inflation-adjusted average for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some sectors in agriculture where our income and  
revenue have continued to rise in the last couple of years -- 
poultry, dairy, fruits, vegetables, nursery and greenhouse 
products. They just seem to trend upward,'' said Keith Collins, 
USDA's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the low commodity prices, federal farm subsidies are  
expected to reach a near-record $16.6 billion this year. That total 
does not include any emergency aid Congress is likely to approve 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is set to debate a farm-economy bailout this week  
that could reach $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the Arkansas poultry farmer, is unlikely to benefit. As  
with most federal farm aid, virtually all of the money would go to 
grain and cotton growers because fruits, vegetables, livestock and 
poultry receive little if any federal subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall financial position of farmers is relatively sound,  
according to USDA statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Average farm equity, adjusted for inflation, is up 1 percent  
from 1998 and has risen 50 percent since the mid-1980s, when 
skyrocketing interest rates and huge grain surpluses sent farmland 
values plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm debt is down 12 percent since 1984 and declined slightly  
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't see a 1980s-type crisis'' this year, said Collins.  
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Dick  
Lugar, R-Ind., is trying to slow the rush in Congress to pass a 
large bailout. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sending his colleagues a series of mailings pointing out  
how much the government is already doing for growers. Among other 
things, the government guarantees farmers a minimum return for 
their crops no matter how low prices go. This year those subsidies 
are expected to total $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	While conceding that ``emotions are understandably running high  
from areas in our country where farmers are hurting,'' whatever 
Congress does to help them should be based on an ``assessment of 
actual farm income needs,'' Lugar said in one letter. ``Rural 
America deserves no less. Taxpayers expect as much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats are proposing $10 billion in emergency aid, and  
Republicans are working on a package of between $7 billion and $10 
billion. Sen. Tom Harkin, who is leading the Democratic effort, 
says many farmers will go out of business unless they get 
additional help soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farm families and rural communities are in the worst economic  
crisis of at least a decade, and perhaps since the Great 
Depression,'' said Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall economic numbers mask the problems facing many  
farmers who grow grain and cotton. Cash receipts for soybeans are 
expected to fall 17 percent this year, 11 percent for wheat, 10 
percent for cotton, and 9 percent for corn. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, cash receipts for broiler chickens, Miller's  
business, are holding steady this year and are up more than 25 
percent over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmland values are down 6 percent in Illinois this year and 3  
percent in Indiana and Iowa, according to the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Chicago. In parts of the region the drop is greater -- 11 percent 
in central Iowa, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Lugar, Congress' most prominent farmer, acknowledges that  
income from his 600-acre corn and soybean operation in Indiana 
dropped 18 percent last year from 1997. He does not expect this 
year to be any better. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is a worldwide glut of grain.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm law was supposed to prevent price-depressing  
surpluses of U.S. grain and other crops by scaling back on 
production-based subsidies, but prices fell anyway because of 
strong crops worldwide and economic problems in Asia and Russia.

	ASSISI, Italy (AP) -- The 17th-century church on the site where  
St. Francis of Assisi died reopened Saturday, two years after 
earthquakes crumbled it and other priceless structures across 
central Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters helped with one of the last repairs before the  
reopening of St. Mary of the Angels: putting a gold-leaf-covered 
statue of the Madonna back atop the basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	``A sign of hope,'' the Rev. Massimo Reschiglian of the  
Franciscan order said of the reopening. Italy's minister of public 
works and other officials attended, and listened to a message sent 
by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	The church, on a plain below Assisi, surrounds a chapel dating  
to the 4th century. The chapel was the first center of the 
Franciscan order; St. Clare was consecrated there, and St. Francis 
died there in 1226. 
</P>
<P>
	Repairs took 10 months.  
</P>
<P>
	Two quakes hit the hill towns of central Italy on Sept. 26,  
1997, killing 10, rendering thousands homeless and damaging an 
estimated 100,000 buildings in Italy's Umbria and Marche regions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Assisi alone, 373 public works projects for earthquake repair  
are under way. Engineers are working on seismic reinforcement as 
they piece together and prop up the buildings, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is still under way at the hard-hit upper church of the  
13th-century St. Francis Basilica in Assisi. The lower level 
reopened soon after the quakes. The upper level is expected to 
reopen in 2000, but without -- at least temporarily -- frescoes 
shaken down by the quakes.

<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was no time to be sick.  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Humbert's ear was so infected when the Pan American Games  
water polo competition began, he missed the first two matches in 
the Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tired, his head aching, his chest congested, his ear shut,  
Humbert and several ailing teammates set up a sick bay where they 
rested between matches. Their bodies were suffering, but their game 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 Humbert scored five goals Friday night as the  
United States beat Cuba 11-7 to claim the gold medal and earn a 
trip to the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came to the pool and my temperature was 101,'' Humbert said.  
``This week hasn't been a lot of fun. We had to quarantine all the 
sick guys. We've come through some adversity, and this feels 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humbert's offense was a big part of the Americans' commanding  
victory over a Cuban team they beat just 6-4 when their lanky 
two-meter man couldn't play early in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sparking the United States was the defense and  
length-of-the-pool passing of goalie Daniel Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Oeding and Humbert got behind the Cuban defense and  
took long passes from Hackett for easy scores within 40 seconds of 
one another to open the second period and make it 4-1. The United 
States led 6-2 at the half and 10-3 after three periods, using 
their superior swimming ability and strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could throw one any better than the one to  
Chris,'' Hackett said. ``You're always confident he will finish any 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game was just a test because half our guys have the flu,  
including Chris. He couldn't even practice all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's basketball team looked like a group that hasn't  
spent much time together, which is precisely the case, but still 
won its opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Reserves Michelle Marciniak and Amy Herrig gave Team USA the  
spark it needed to get past Argentina 63-55. Marciniak got the 
Americans going with two length-of-the-court drives for baskets, 
and Herrig had 15 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States isn't using a top team in the Pan Am Games,  
and the players didn't start practicing until July 17. The lack of 
time together was evident as coach Nell Fortner substituted 
constantly looking for the right combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can practice all you want, but the real experience comes  
from playing games with refs, scorekeepers, fans and everything 
else,'' Marciniak said. ``There's no substitute for that. We 
learned more tonight than from all the practices going against each 
other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men open tonight against Cuba.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. pitcher Michele Smith almost duplicated teammate Danielle  
Henderson's perfect game in Thursday's softball opener. Smith was 
perfect through six innings before yielding a hit in a 5-0 victory 
over Netherlands Antilles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubans dominated the final night of track and field by winning  
five of the 10 events, including a fourth straight Pan Ams gold by 
high jumper Javier Sotomayor. Sotomayor took only two jumps, 
clearing 7 feet, 2 1/2 inches and 7-6 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Also winning for Cuba was Anier Garcia, who ran the 110-meter  
hurdles in 13.17 seconds to break one of the meet's oldest records, 
13.20 by Renaldo Nehemiah in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba finished track and field with 11 gold medals. That was one  
more than the United States, which was shut out in the relays and 
failed to win a gold Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is tremendous,'' said Jose Salmeron, spokesman for the  
Cuban team. ``We did it with spectacular marks and in spite of not 
having as many key athletes as in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also suffered disappointments in field hockey and  
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Any chances for the United States to qualify for the Olympics in  
men's field hockey ended with a 4-1 loss to Argentina. The men's 
volleyball team fell out of medal contention when it lost to 
Venezuela 25-21, 28-26, 25-22. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in the games, the U.S. women's volleyball  
team was swept by Cuba, but the Americans could still win the 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Things went better for the United States in the ring on the  
opening night of boxing. Flyweight Jose Navarro of Los Angeles beat 
Carlos Valcarcel of Puerto Rico in the new format of four 
two-minute rounds. Welterweight LeChaunce Shepherd of Milwaukee, 
Wis., stopped Nicaragua's Isaac Caballero in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won the premier rowing event, the men's eight with  
cox. The U.S. team took control at 500 meters and won by nearly 
three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, an official from the International Baseball  
Association told several reporters that two Cuban baseball players 
had defected. But Canadian immigration officials and sources close 
to the Cuban team said the official was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the players mentioned by IBA delegate Enzo Gesu was  
pitcher Jose Ibar. But he was in the dugout today when Cuba 
advanced to the semifinals by beating the Dominican Republic 3-1.

<HEADLINE> Saints Turn to Computers To Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Although the New Orleans Saints' offense  
may have been last in the NFL last season, it's among the first now 
-- at least in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to boost their ability to pass, catch, run and  
score, the Saints have ditched their playbooks. Instead, they're 
using mice to work the bugs out of their offense, computerizing 
everything from plays to game plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the business of training people and there's no  
difference in training stockbrokers or salesmen or football 
players,'' said Sean Lundy of Knowledge Inc., a Denver-based 
software development firm. ``This program breaks down what they 
have to learn and presents it in a clear manner that's 
user-friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall of Fame receiver Raymond Berry, a longtime friend of coach  
Mike Ditka and a consultant for Knowledge Inc., tipped Ditka off to 
the program. Lundy said the Saints coach was sold immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mike Ditka was with the Bears, they were one of the first  
teams to go from film to video,'' Lundy said. ``He's the innovator 
here too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints were the first NFL team to convert their playbooks to  
software. This season only the offense is on CDs. Next season the 
team will add defense and special teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Patriots have since computerized their offense,  
and the Dallas Cowboys will use the program for offense, defense 
and special teams next year. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans bought 65 laptops for the offensive players and  
coaches. The players' programs are tailored for their specific 
positions, plays, and responsibilities. Players can test 
themselves, to see how much they've learned, and the program charts 
how much time they spend studying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know what type of computer literacy the players  
would have,'' Lundy said. ``But it's been very, very high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players' fascination with computers was one of the factors  
that sold Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think this is the wave of the future,'' Ditka said. ``We  
think everybody is going to go with it. The reason we did it is 
it's not easy to get these guys to read, but I think it's easy to 
get them to play video games. That's basically what this is -- a 
video game. But it also teaches the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, a player draws out his route on a play. If he's  
wrong, the computer shows where he should have gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Players can see both diagrams of plays and how they work, or the  
actual video of the play from a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The program also provides the quarterback calls and even crowd  
noise. In fact, receivers study part of their program with 
earphones to get used to the clamor of noisy games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great,'' tight end Cam Cleeland said. ``I can have  
this in front of me at all times. I can take it home. I can use it 
on my television. I can take it with me on the plane on road trips. 
Who needs to open a playbook and flip through pages when I'm one or 
two clicks away from learning?'' 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike a playbook, Lundy pointed out, the computers are  
secure. If one is left behind or stolen, the program is protected.

<HEADLINE> Superstitious Boggs Nears 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Wade Boggs eats chicken and  
cheesecake before each game and likes two hot dogs, a bag of 
barbecue potato chips and an iced tea after a night's work. 
</P>
<P>
	He follows a ritual between meals, too.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Devil Rays third baseman might not be able to  
predict exactly when he'll get his 3,000th hit, but he certainly 
won't change his routine in the final days of the quest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever he's done, it's worked for 23 years. So I figure I'm  
not messing with superstitions,'' his wife, Debbie, said. ``I don't 
have any. They're all his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs leaves home at the same time, 1:47 for a 7:05 game; runs  
at 6:47 for a 7:05 game or 7:17 for a 7:35 game; takes 100 ground 
balls during warmups and will try on dozens of batting gloves to 
find a pair that seem right for the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the scoreboard operator in Toronto flipped the clock from  
7:16 to 7:18 to try to throw him off. It didn't matter, Boggs ran 
anyway and got two hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you try to interrupt my routine, then sorry,'' the  
five-time AL batting champion said. ``If you can't respect that, 
then I feel sorry for the person trying to upset the routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The superstitions aren't limited to his pregame ritual.  
</P>
<P>
	Boggs steps over the foul line when he sprints on the field to  
play third base and steps on it when he returns to the dugout. He 
never stands on the mound during a pitcher's conference, draws a 
good-luck symbol in the dirt before each plate appearance, and 
changes the gum he's chewing when he doesn't get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't bother asking him to help compile a list of his  
superstitions. The 12-time All-Star says it would take too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why so many? To make the day go by,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had one or two, I wouldn't have anything to do. So I have  
80 or 100 that I go through during the day, and they fall into 
place. I know exactly what I'm going to do along the way. That 
makes me relax and get into a frame of mind that I need to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going hitless in the first two games of Tampa Bay's  
current six-game road trip, Boggs still needs eight hits to reach 
3,000. Ideally, the Devil Rays would like him to reach the plateau 
during a six-game homestand that begins Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old third baseman grew up in Tampa, and the chance  
to get the magic hit before family and friends was one of the 
reasons he signed with an expansion team after spending his first 
16 seasons with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He's being chased to the 3,000-hit mark by San Diego's Tony  
Gwynn, who needed nine going into Saturday night's game against 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring injuries, they'll be the first players to reach the  
milestone in the same season since Robin Yount did it three weeks 
before George Brett in 1992. They were the fifth pair to get No. 
3,000 in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs said it would be fitting if he and Gwynn did it in the  
same year and that it didn't matter who got there first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our careers have paralleled each other,'' Boggs said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not going to be an asterisk at the end of my career  
that says, `Tony Gwynn beat Wade Boggs to 3,000.' If he gets there 
first, more power to him. I just want to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who broke into the majors shortly after Boggs, said his  
counterpart set the standard for players who make their mark as 
contact hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The two never considered themselves rivals because they play in  
different leagues. Yet they feel a connection as players who helped 
put ``line-drive hitters on the map'' during a time when most young 
players came into the majors wanting to hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the blocks with seven straight 200-hit seasons,  
just rolling along,'' the eight-time NL batting champion said of 
Boggs. ``He was the type of hitter I really wanted to be like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs is especially proud of his ability to remain productive.  
</P>
<P>
	His lifetime batting average of .329 ranks third among major  
leaguers who have played since World War II, behind Ted Williams' 
.344 and Gwynn's .340. Heading into the weekend series in Oakland, 
Boggs was hitting .295 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest adjustment has been to what he calls a new  
generation of pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys I used to face in the early to mid-80s have all  
retired. ... Now you're trying to learn guys that are 23, 24, 25 
years old coming up from the minor leagues,'' Boggs said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like going from the PGA Tour to the Senior Tour.  
Your golf swing remains the same. It's just that the courses 
change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs entered the season needing 78 hits to join the other 21  
members of the 3,000 club, and he was determined to have fun. He 
sought advice from Paul Molitor on how to handle the experience and 
says the hype surrounding the chase hasn't been a distraction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays, though struggling through another last-place  
season, are enjoying the ride, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a perfect fit when we were starting up this expansion  
club for two reasons. He could still play the game and we were 
bringing him back home,'' general manager Chuck LaMar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Bobby Witt is one of the more than 700 pitchers who  
have given up hits to Boggs. He remembers facing him in Boston and 
nearly being hit in the face by a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know I was upside down,'' said Witt, who's  
pitched in the majors for 13 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just watching him hit was amazing. Watching how he was able to  
go out there and get three one night and come back with two the 
next night. He's just a great hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaMar said it's the result of all Boggs' hard work and  
determination. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's players that are in the Hall of Fame that are more  
gifted. But I'm not sure there's anybody there that has taken the 
game any more seriously and has truly come to the ball park every 
day ready to play.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Goes Door-to-Door in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DERRY, N.H. (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley went door-to-door in  
three New Hampshire towns Saturday, joining volunteers who spent 
the past week canvassing this key primary state on behalf of his 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator said the effort was ``massive,  
early and intentional,'' a bow to the independent streak of New 
Hampshire voters. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign said more than 500 Bradley supporters from 14  
states spent seven days visiting 100,000 front doors in 31 New 
Hampshire cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
	On doorknobs they hung handbills describing Bradley's career on  
the basketball court and in the Senate, and promising that as 
president he ``will work on the big, unfinished business of 
America'' -- racial equity, health care for all, reducing poverty 
and reforming campaign finances, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Voters showing an interest in learning about the candidate were  
invited to have coffee Saturday morning coffee with Bradley at a 
Manchester restaurant, where a blue Bradley for President banner 
declared, ``He has made the long shot before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason we're (going door-to-door) so early is to show  
respect to the voters of New Hampshire and to invite them into the 
process of running for president,'' Bradley explained. ``I'm trying 
to do this campaign in a different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A victory in New Hampshire's leadoff primary is critical if  
Bradley is to beat Vice President Al Gore. Bradley said the state 
is a good place to test his low-key, open-ear campaign style. 
</P>
<P>
	But New Hampshire pollster Kelly Myers said ``retail politicking  
is less important than it used to be,'' even in a state known for 
its retail politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``a big canvassing effort at this point in the  
race can be very effective. You can get introduced to voters, you 
can get your platform to them in writing, and you can get your name 
recognition up. For a person like Bill Bradley, that's very 
important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley set the tone for his run when he selected Gina Glantz as  
his campaign manager. She specialized in grass-roots campaigns, and 
her consulting firm helped create Hands Across America, the 1986 
nationwide demonstration in support of the hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's campaign Web site includes a ``community involvement''  
section that encourages people to get involved in any of 15 ways, 
from writing to a local newspaper to rounding up votes personally 
in New Hampshire or Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bradfield logged in from Bend, Ore., and was inspired. A  
registered Republican until decided to back Bradley, he flew to New 
Hampshire last week and spent seven days walking door-to-door for 
his candidate of choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sucked in by the Web site,'' he explained, adding that  
he likes Bradley's commitment to campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure there were a lot of other things I could have done  
this week,'' said Susan Wilson, a Bradley activist who flew in from 
Santa Monica, Calif. ``There's not been somebody who's made me feel 
this way since Bobby Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the New Hampshire volunteers were dubbed ``brigade  
captains.'' Bradfield and others in the state's northern reaches -- 
including the tiny town of Dixville Notch, whose residents cast the 
first votes in the state's primary -- were called the ``road 
warriors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volunteers said they were encouraged about Bradley's chances.  
</P>
<P>
	``We encountered an awful lot of uncommitted people,'' said Mike  
Dowling of Ocean Grove, N.J., who went door-to-door in Londonderry.

<HEADLINE> 20th Swiss Disaster Victim Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERLAKEN, Switzerland (AP) -- The body of one of the last  
tourists missing in a Swiss Alps river flood was found, bringing 
the death count from the canyoning disaster to 20, Bern state 
police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers using underwater cameras located the body late Friday  
night, 207 feet deep in Lake Brienz, a few miles downstream from 
the scene of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy occurred when unexpected floods swept through the  
canyon and engulfed tourists and guides bodysurfing feet-first 
through foaming waters of Saxeten Brook, near Interlaken Alpine 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	One person was still missing. Police said they would suspend the  
search until Monday to give exhausted rescuers a chance to recover. 
The rescue effort would continue to concentrate on Lake Brienz. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists were ``canyoning,'' a new extreme sport in which  
participants slide, jump or rappel down waterfalls and mountain 
streams into gorges without rafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Friday they were investigating whether five  
guides on the expedition, hosted by Adventure World, were guilty of 
negligent homicide for not taking notice of a pending storm, which 
caused the floods. 
</P>
<P>
	Another three guides who went with the group of 45 vacationers  
were among those killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police so far have released the names of nine victims. Relatives  
are still helping identify the badly battered bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service is scheduled for Thursday in Interlaken.

<HEADLINE> Pitchers Sought As Deadline Looms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Jim Leyritz will wear pinstripes once again in October.  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees made the first move in what shaped up as a  
busy Saturday, reacquiring former postseason hero Jim Leyritz from 
the San Diego Padres for minor league pitcher Geraldo Padua. 
</P>
<P>
	Many other deals were expected by the midnight EDT non-waiver  
trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Finley, Kevin Appier and Roberto Hernandez were among the  
top players most likely to move as contenders looked for pitching. 
Baltimore first baseman Will Clark seemed to be in the mix, 
possibly headed to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Also said to be available: pitchers Arthur Rhodes, Juan Guzman  
and Jesse Orosco of Baltimore, Darryl Kile of Colorado, Jeff 
Fassero of Seattle and Ugueth Urbina of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL East-leading Yankees had thought about sending struggling  
starter Andy Pettitte to Philadelphia, but manager Joe Torre said 
before Saturday's game at Boston, ``I don't think it's going to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was still a chance, though, New York would bolster its  
bullpen by getting Hernandez from Tampa Bay. In the meantime, the 
Yankees completed a deal for Leyritz. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have traded me anywhere, but it shows the class of  
this organization to give me another opportunity back in New 
York,'' Leyritz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing in New York for as many years as I did, it's almost  
like being in the World Series every day. I thrived on it while I 
was there,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz, 35, is hitting .239 with eight home runs and 21 RBIs.  
He can play first base or DH, and was Pettitte's personal catcher 
with the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyritz has 12 career postseason hits, seven of them homers. His  
three-run shot in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series at Atlanta sent 
the Yankees toward the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Leyritz hit four homers in the playoffs for the  
Padres, who later got swept by the Yankees in the World Series. 
This week, Leyritz was activated from the disabled list, having 
broken his left hand June 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres got minor league pitcher Geraldo Padua for Leyritz.  
The 22-year-old righty was 9-4 with a 2.86 ERA for Class A 
Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a swap of 25-year-old minor league pitchers, the Florida  
Marlins sent Brandon Villafuerte to the Detroit Tigers for Mike 
Drumright. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Central-leading Cleveland Indians led the pursuit of  
Finley, mostly because of his 16-9 lifetime mark against the 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley, meanwhile, was supposed to start Saturday night at home  
against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I'll call the press box in the third inning and check,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also eyed Finley, who had the right to veto any  
trade as a 10-and-5 player -- 10 years in the majors, the last five 
with the same team. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston wanted Appier to boost its ailing rotation. The longtime  
Kansas City ace recently waived his limited no-trade clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, there were more than 10 trades on July 31, with Randy  
Johnson going from Seattle to Houston in the day's biggest deal. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, plenty of players were being mentioned in the rumor  
mill. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can speak for the whole team,'' Seattle shortstop  
Alex Rodriguez said Friday night. ``We just want the trading 
deadline to come and go. I think we're all tradable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trades can be made after the deadline, but only after players  
pass through waivers. That can be difficult, because any team can 
put in a claim and block a potential deal. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many possibilities leading up to midnight, it was easy  
to see why everyone was jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, most everyone.  
</P>
<P>
	``Unless I get traded, I'm not nervous,'' Seattle manager Lou  
Piniella said.

<HEADLINE> Spacecraft Hits Moon, No Dust Seen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lunar Prospector's violent collision with the  
moon on Saturday left no visible cloud of dust, but researchers 
still hope to find traces of water in a vapor plume possibly 
created by the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 observatory telescopes focused on the moon's south  
pole as the spacecraft, in its final task for science, dove toward 
a frozen crater and smashed itself around 5:52 a.m. EDT Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts hoped the fire and violence of the collision, unseen  
from the Earth, would vaporize ice thought to exist in the shaded 
crater and send a wet plume, detectable by special instruments, 
spiraling into the lunar sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwin S. Barker of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory,  
a lead researcher in the project, said telescopes equipped with 
ultraviolet detectors took hours of data following the impact, 
searching for the chemical signature of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really too early to draw any conclusions,'' Barker said.  
``So far, we haven't seen anything that says water or anything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final results of the water search await analysis of the readings  
by the telescopes in Texas, California, Massachusetts and Hawaii, 
and by the Hubble Space Telescope, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	What researchers are looking for is either water, H2O, or the  
hydroxyl radical, called OH, formed when sunlight splits a hydrogen 
atom away from a water molecule. Both OH and water have distinctive 
spectroscopic signatures when viewed with special telescope 
filters. 
</P>
<P>
	The signature for water could be found quickly in the data, said  
Barker, but uncovering evidence of the hydroxyl radical could take 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for water is more than a scientific curiosity. Large  
stores of ice on the moon would make it much easier and cheaper to 
establish a base there, or to use the moon as a way station to more 
distant bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Water can be broken down chemically into hydrogen and oxygen  
that can propel a rocket or power generators. Oxygen also would 
provide a breathable atmosphere for lunar explorers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was scheduled to end its mission on Saturday,  
and scientists running the $63 million project decided smashing the 
craft into the moon in search for water was a fitting end. 
</P>
<P>
	David Morse, a NASA spokesman at the Ames Research Center in  
Moffett Field, Calif., said mission scientists ``were very happy 
and whooped it up a little'' when it became clear the craft had hit 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and spent about 18 months  
in lunar orbit, using five instruments to map the magnetic, 
chemical and gravitational character of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	One instrument received a signal for hydrogen, leading  
scientists to suggest there was frozen water in the deep, 
constantly shaded craters around the lunar poles. By some 
estimates, the could be as much as 300 million metric tons of ice 
in the frozen lunar soil. 
</P>
<P>
	David B. Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher, was the  
first to suggest using Prospector as sort of a rocket-powered 
diving rod. He did calculations that showed if Prospector crashed 
into one of the frigid craters, heat from the impact could vaporize 
the ice and form a wet cloud visible from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Although mission scientists believed there was only a 10 percent  
chance of success, the possibility of harvesting a final bit of 
science was worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said Saturday that he also had hoped for a dust cloud,  
but none was seen by any of the 20 or so observatory telescopes 
that focused on the moon at the moment of impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't see any dust. It is a bit of a disappointment,'' he  
said. ``We know it crashed. We just don't know where exactly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers,  
or ALPO, encouraged amateur astronomers to focus telescopes on the 
moon and report any signs of Prospector's impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lack of obvious evidence, officials said Lunar  
Prospector appeared to have followed the instructions from the 
ground to slow itself with an automatic rocket firing and then 
smash against the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact point was not visible from Earth, but NASA engineers  
believe that the craft was in line to hit the target crater. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything went normally, so we have every reason to believe  
it made it to the impact site,'' said David Folta, the Goddard 
Space Flight Center engineer who gave the final guidance signals to 
Prospector. ``There is no reason to believe we didn't get to where 
we wanted to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Folta said the spacecraft received the signals and was operating  
normally when it went over the lunar north pole and disappeared 
behind the moon where it was to ignite its rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the rocket firing failed, said Folta, the craft would have  
reappeared in orbit, still sending out radio signals. Instead, 
there was only silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker said there is a possibility the spacecraft hit at such a  
shallow angle that it skipped, like a flat stone across a pond, 
before it came to rest. This would diminish the dust cloud, he 
said, but there could still be a water plume.

<HEADLINE> 10 Die in Plane Crash in Michigan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- A plane carrying nine  
members of a skydiving group that was holding its annual campout 
crashed shortly after takeoff Saturday, killing all the passengers 
and the pilot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, a twin-engine Beech King Air 200, came down less than  
a mile from Marine City Airport at 8:20 a.m. in this township about 
40 miles north of Detroit, said State Police Sgt. Craig Nyeholt. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause wasn't known.  
</P>
<P>
	The pilot of the plane, Paul Myks, was a Spirit Airlines pilot  
who flew DC-9's for the airline, said Gary Cooper, regional 
director of the U.S. Parachuting Association. 
</P>
<P>
	All the skydivers on board were members of the Parahawks, a  
skydiving group that apparently had gathered at the airport for its 
three-day annual pig roast and campout. The event reportedly was to 
end Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman who answered the telephone at the Parahawks skydiving  
center at Marine City Airport refused to discuss the club or the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very extended family,'' said James Relken, the local  
Red Cross chapter director, who was at the crash site counseling 
families of the victims. ``The immediate family may not be here, 
but they're extended family to each other. That's very evident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Sers, who said he was the brother of one of the victims,  
said the Parahawks jumped weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where my brother loved to be. This is his passion.  
That's what he loved to do,'' said Sers, who declined to give his 
brother's name. ``If you've got to die doing something, it ought to 
be something you have a passion for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Wilson said his 22-year-old nephew Roger Engle III had  
made more than 100 jumps and was also an expert at 
parachute-packing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was out here all the time. He jumped a whole lot. We were  
hoping that he wasn't (on the plane), but his grandpa knew he 
was,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Macomb County Medical Examiner Werner Spitz said the plane,  
which reportedly crashed shortly after takeoff, broke into three 
parts and the victim's bodies were strewn across a 50-yard area of 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Spitz, one body found in the cockpit was not  
wearing a parachute and is believed to be that of the pilot. The 
other nine victims were wearing parachutes, but they never had an 
opportunity to jump, Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Franz, who lives near the airport, said he heard the  
plane taking off -- then the engine went dead. A second or two 
later, he said, there was a loud crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Miller, 45, and his son Dustin were sitting in their living  
room when they saw the plane coming toward the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``Planes come in and out all the time. But this one was a sharp  
bank that was more than usual. We could see the bottom of the 
plane,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Dustin: ``It was coming in awfully fast. I heard a  
crunching sound like a can being crunched. Then the ground shook a 
little and we saw the black smoke and called 911.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Get Taylor for Isringhausen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets bolstered the strongest part  
of their team Saturday, acquiring closer Billy Taylor from the 
Oakland Athletics for right-handers Jason Isringhausen and Greg 
McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 37, was fourth in the AL with 26 saves, but will likely  
join Turk Wendell and Dennis Cook as set-up men for Armando Benitez 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets bullpen has been the second stingiest in the majors  
this season and is a major reason why the team was only a half-game 
behind Atlanta in the NL East. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relievers have been overtaxed all season, especially  
since closer John Franco was sidelined four weeks ago with a 
partially torn tendon on the middle finger of his left hand. Franco 
is expected to miss about one more month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have gone 126 games without a complete game -- 14 short  
of the major league record held by Anaheim -- and Mets relievers are 
averaging more than 3.2 innings per game. Wendell leads the league 
with 55 appearances, followed by Benitez (53) and Cook (50). 
</P>
<P>
	New York also acquired left-hander Chuck McElroy in a  
five-player deal from Colorado hours before the trading deadline. 
The Mets sent outfielder Brian McRae, reliever Rigo Beltran and 
minor league outfielder Thomas Johnson to the Rockies for McElroy 
and outfielder Darryl Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set out to strengthen our bullpen and we certainly did  
that,'' Mets GM Steve Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	And in a third deal, the Mets traded minor leaguer Craig  
Paquette to St. Louis for infielder Shawon Dunston. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, once one of the Mets brightest pitching prospects,  
has been hampered by injuries throughout his career and was sent to 
the bullpen earlier this year. He is 1-3 with a 6.41 ERA this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We love Isringhausen's arm, period,'' A's general manager  
Billy Beane said. ``We have to find some power arms in the bullpen. 
He can throw 95-97 MPH and it's hard to find that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen, 26, went 9-2 with a 2.81 ERA as a rookie in 1995.  
Along with Paul Wilson and Bill Pulsipher, Isringhausen was 
supposed to anchor the Mets' pitching staff for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, all three have been beset by injury and  
ineffectiveness. Wilson underwent reconstructive surgery on his 
right elbow in March, and Pulsipher was traded to Milwaukee last 
season after reconstructive surgery of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Isringhausen's once-promising career has been slowed by a  
succession of injuries including a broken wrist in 1997, 
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder and elbow in 1996, and 
reconstructive surgery on his right elbow last season. He also 
battled through a 1997 bout with tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
	McMichael was 1-1 with a 4.82 ERA in 19 appearances this year.  
</P>
<P>
	This is the second major deal between the two teams in the last  
eight days. On July 23, Oakland sent their ace Kenny Rogers to New 
York for two minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics also acquired Kevin Appier from the Royals for  
pitchers Blake Stein, Jeff D'Amico and Brad Rigby.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Jones Is Fashion Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- He has two Super Bowl rings to go with 70  
suits ranging in color from peach to lime-green, and he's a 
romantic who married his wife on Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver offensive lineman Tony Jones even has a street named  
after him in Ty Cobb's hometown of Royston, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those things you usually get when you're dead, not  
when you're alive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones knows what it's like to be both. He died and came back to  
life during seemingly routine elbow surgery four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had an allergic reaction to some of the medicine they gave  
me and had a heart attack,'' Jones said. ``My heart stopped. They 
tried to shock me, and it didn't work. They gave me adrenaline and 
brought me back. I think it was just God's way of telling me he can 
stop me when he wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If someone was looking out for him, Jones has an appropriate way  
of returning the favor as he makes an anonymous living protecting 
quarterbacks and opening holes for MVP running back Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The unassuming work was rewarded last season when Davis became  
the fourth back in NFL history to run for 2,000 yards and Jones was 
selected to his first Pro Bowl after 11 seasons with Cleveland, 
Baltimore and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a huge man, a massive man,'' said Davis, who bought Jones  
and the other linemen golf clubs for their efforts. ``Having him on 
that left side means a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his lack of notoriety, Jones dresses like a 6-foot-5,  
290-pound movie star trying to impress the paparazzi at a Hollywood 
premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	His wardrobe consists of suits for all occasions, including a  
team-spirit ensemble with navy blue pants, a Broncos-orange jacket 
and orange alligator-skin shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	If Crayola makes the color, Jones wears it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have different colors for different moods,'' he said. ``I  
like to dress flamboyantly because I like a lot of colors. I'm not 
scared to throw on peach or red or lime-green. A lot of big guys 
are, and I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fashion statement has not carried over to other Broncos  
lineman and Jones has long given up trying to turn his teammates 
into a weighty group of Deion Sanders impersonators. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's unique,'' said guard Mark Schlereth. ``He knows none of  
us could pull off the wardrobe that he has. He's the only guy that 
could pull that off.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              *Eagles    	
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Donovan McNabb, who ended his holdout by signing a  
seven-year, $54 million contract, missed both of the Eagles' 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb's 32-page contract was so long and complicated that by  
the time the NFL let him sign it, it was too late to join his new 
team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Amani Toomer, whose last-minute touchdown catch  
knocked the Denver Broncos from the undefeated ranks last season, 
signed a four-year, $11.2 million contract with the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-year player received a $3.5 million signing bonus.  
</P>
<P>
                             *Jaguars    	
</P>
<P>
	The Jaguars signed free-agent linebacker Lonnie Marts to take  
the place of Bryce Paup, who is recovering from a torn pectoral 
muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	Marts, a nine-year veteran, started 15 games with the Tennessee  
Oilers last season. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bills    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Andre Reed, the team's only holdout, is expected  
to arrive at camp in time for Sunday night's team meeting. Reed is 
said to be in agreement with the Bills on a contract extension, 
although the team wouldn't comment. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Running back Jerome Bettis, whose troublesome left knee swelled  
at Friday's practice, said he felt better after a brief running 
session during Saturday's morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, center Dermontti Dawson was injured during a pileup during  
the afternoon practice. The preliminary prognosis was a sprained 
medial collateral ligament in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Chargers    	
</P>
<P>
	Free safety Darren Perry retired, the day before the Chargers  
were to fly to Australia for their exhibition opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Riley said the seven-year veteran knocked on his door  
at 7:30 a.m. and told him he was retiring due to an ailment in his 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Falcons    	
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons learned that running back Gary Downs and rookie  
center Todd McClure both suffered season-ending knee injuries at 
practice a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Downs sustained a torn lateral collateral ligament, while  
McClure tore an anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pete Carroll and starting strong safety Lawyer Milloy said  
they've buried the hatchet, one day after the Pro Bowl defensive 
back blasted team management for releasing veteran safety Willie 
Clay. 
</P>
<P>
	Milloy, a fourth-year veteran, apologized for having expressed  
private feelings publicly. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Panthers    	
</P>
<P>
	Wide receiver Rae Carruth, making a comeback from a fractured  
right foot last season that required surgery, has looked very good 
two days into training camp. Carruth has made one impressive catch 
after another in a push to recover from a lost season in which he 
played only two games. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos have waived punter Jeff Baker and quarterback Chuck  
Clements, coach Mike Shanahan said. Baker and Clements both joined 
the team as free agents during the offseason.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala 4, Morelia 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Guatemala overcame two ejections to defeat  
Mexico's Atletico Morelia 4-2 on penalty kicks to win the Coliseum 
Cup soccer tournament Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams played to a 1-1 draw after regulation in the second  
game of a doubleheader at the Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Mexican club, Atlas of Guadalajara, took third place  
with a 3-2 victory against El Salvador in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala played with nine players in stoppage time.  
</P>
<P>
	Jorge Perez received his second yellow card in the 42nd minute,  
and Nelson Caceres got a red card in the 90th minute. Referee Tim 
Weyland issued nine yellow cards and two red cards. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Julio Engleton made two saves during the penalty-kick  
sequence. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Fernandez's soft shot hit Engleton's feet as the goalkeeper  
dived to his right. Then Engleton dived to his left to stop Jose 
Luis Malibran's weak shot to the right post. 
</P>
<P>
	Guatemala's Everaldo Valencia, who had suffered from back spasms  
during Friday's practice, converted his kick to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Morelia took a 1-0 lead when Fernandez scored in the 73rd  
minute. Carlos Morales' low cross from the left wing sailed threw 
the legs of a Morelia forward to Fernandez, who converted from 15 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	One minute later, Nolly Sanchez tied the score with a 16-yard  
shot inside the left post. Sanchez entered the game in the 70th 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third-place game, Jorge Santillana scored twice in the  
first 19 minutes to lead Atlas. Teammate Juan Urteaga added what 
proved to be the winning goal in the 23rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
	El Salvador's Ernesto Gochez and Alexander Amaya del Cid scored  
in the 44th and 50th minutes, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Picks Tried Hubbell, Trie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief judge of the U.S. District Court  
bypassed the traditional random assignment system to send criminal 
cases against presidential friends Webster Hubbell and Charlie Trie 
to judges appointed by President Clinton, according to court 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson's decision to abandon  
the longtime random computer assignment for the high-profile cases 
has raised concerns among several other judges, according to 
Associated Press interviews with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges also raise concerns about an appearance of possible  
conflicts of interest, because judges who got the cases were 
friendly with key players -- presidential confidant Vernon Jordan 
and defense lawyer Reid Weingarten -- and made rulings that 
handicapped prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Half a dozen judges, Republicans as well as Democrats, said they  
have high regard for the ethics and work of the two judges 
involved, Paul L. Friedman and James Robertson, and do not believe 
they were improperly influenced. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judges, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they  
have discussed among themselves the public perception of ignoring 
the random draw -- which is used in almost all cases -- and passing 
over more experienced judges appointed by presidents of both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	One judge said his colleagues have discussed whether assigning  
cases directly rather than using the random lottery raises ``an 
appearance problem at least'' and ``whether there has been 
impartial administration of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Friedman and Robertson all declined repeated requests  
for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	The airing of the behind-the-scenes controversy provides a rare  
window into a court process sealed from public view. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, an appointee of President Carter, assigned:  
</P>
<P>
	--Friedman the Trie case, the first major prosecution from the  
Justice Department probe of Democratic fund raising. Clinton 
nominated Friedman, a former president of the local bar, in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	--Robertson the Hubbell tax case, Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr's first prosecution in Washington. Robertson is an 
ex-president of the local bar and a former partner at the law firm 
of former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson was nominated by Clinton in the last days of Cutler's  
tenure as counsel in 1994. Robertson donated $1,000 to Clinton's 
1992 presidential bid and has said he ``worked on the periphery'' 
of that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson bypassed the random draw for these cases, there  
were 12 full-time judges on the federal court, seven of them 
Clinton appointees. Four were Republican appointees. The court also 
has a number of senior judges who work part-time. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said the assignments to Clinton-nominated judges did not  
violate any rules, but could shake public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as assigning a recently appointed judge of the same  
party, it's dangerous, it's risky, it's hazardous because the 
outcome might support the cynical view that the judge did not 
decide the matter on the merits even though that may be the 
furthest thing from the truth,'' Columbia University law professor 
H. Richard Uviller said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York University law professor Stephen Gillers said, ``If the  
case is high-profile, that should increase the presumption in favor 
of random selection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assignments were confirmed to AP by several court officials  
with access to parts of the court computer system not available to 
the general public. 
</P>
<P>
	Local court rules give Johnson the right to assign  
``protracted'' cases to specific judges, although nearly all the 
cases in U.S. District Court here are assigned by lottery, court 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Judicial Conference, the policymaking body for the federal  
judiciary, recommends that federal courts randomly assign cases. In 
March, the conference rescinded its 28-year-old policy which 
recommended giving chief judges latitude to make special 
assignments of ``protracted, difficult, or widely publicized 
cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actual practice varies from court to court.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Southern District of New York where there are more than  
two dozen full-time judges, Court Executive Clifford P. Kirsch 
said, ``It's all been by a blind draw ... so it doesn't appear 
anyone is pre-selecting or favoring one judge over another judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson garnered headlines for her rulings against Clinton in  
the Monica Lewinsky scandal, rejecting privilege claims by the 
president and ordering White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and Secret 
Service personnel to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson dismissed the tax case against Hubbell, who eventually  
pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor when an appeals court reinstated 
the case. Johnson allowed a later indictment -- charging Hubbell 
with lying to federal regulators -- to be assigned at random by 
computer. By coincidence, the computer picked Robertson, who threw 
out the central felony count in the case. Hubbell pleaded guilty to 
that same felony count June 30 after an appeals court reversed 
Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
	One politically sensitive aspect of the Hubbell tax evasion  
indictment was a reference to a $62,500 consulting arrangement that 
Jordan helped obtain for Hubbell, making Jordan a potential 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson and Jordan are friends from their days in the civil  
rights movement. Jordan did not return repeated calls seeking 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson assigned the Trie case and two subsequent cases against  
Democratic fund-raisers to Friedman, who tossed out various 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	After one of Friedman's rulings was overturned on appeal, Trie  
agreed to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman and Weingarten, the defense lawyer in two of the three  
fund-raising cases before Friedman, are longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a professional friend, but he's a judge now,'' Weingarten  
said. ``These relationships change when somebody goes to the 
bench.''

<HEADLINE> King Agree to Contract With Bucs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Quarterback Shaun King, a second-round draft  
pick of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, agreed to terms of a four-year 
contract worth more than $2 million on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Tulane star was the 50th player selected after  
leading the Green Wave to their first unbeaten season since 1931. 
He will compete with Eric Zeier for the No. 2 job behind Trent 
Dilfer. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement leaves first-round pick Anthony McFarland, a  
defensive tackle from LSU, as the only Bucs rookie who hasn't come 
to terms. Players report to training camp Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	King, who grew up in St. Petersburg, started 39 of 41 games he  
played at Tulane and set Green Wave career records for total 
offense (9,468 yards), passing yards (8,419), touchdown passes 
(70), completions (646) and pass attempts (1,163). 
</P>
<P>
	He threw at least one TD pass in the final 19 games of his  
college career. Last season, he set a NCAA record with a passing 
efficiency rating of 183.3 while completing 68 percent of his 
attempts for 3,232 yards and 36 TDs.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll From Heat Wave at 96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As Chicago baked in 100-degree weather, thousands  
of hot and sweaty residents were forced to endure the heat without 
air conditioning or fans, due to sporadic power outages and 
brownouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every hour they say it's going to be back on. Nothing,'' Anna  
Losada, who lost power in her home, said Friday. ``It's ridiculous. 
We got to pay them every month.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago residents were not the only ones suffering in extreme  
heat. A wide strip of the nation, from the central states to the 
East Coast, baked for another day Friday with some temperatures 
over 100 degrees and a heat index -- the combination of heat and 
humidity -- near 120. 
</P>
<P>
	The current heat wave has been linked to at least 96 deaths  
across the country since July 19. The Midwest has been hardest hit, 
with Missouri logging 29 heat-related deaths, Illinois 23 and 10 in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The death toll rose from 94 to 96 today.  
</P>
<P>
	In Alabama, Chambers County coroner Dave Collier said today that  
Odell Walker, 84, died Friday at her home in Lafayette, Ala., the 
state's first heat-related death. Ms. Walker had air conditioning 
in her home but had not turned it on, he said. The high temperature 
in the state was 99 degrees on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the News &AMP; Observer (of Raleigh, N.C.,) reported  
that a migrant farm worker died after collapsing while working last 
week in 98-degree heat. The worker had a body temperature of 108 
degrees when he was brought to Duke University Medical Center. His 
death had not been reported earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country Friday, the heat wave was widespread and  
relentless. In Missouri, several cities recorded the 15th straight 
day of temperatures in the 90s. Nashville set a record high of 101, 
breaking the old mark set in 1954. It was 99 in Chattanooga, Tenn., 
tying the mark set in 1952. In other areas, it was 104 degrees in 
Louisville, Ky., 102 degrees in Kenosha, Wis., and 99 degrees in 
Winona, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	While some areas were due to get some relief from the heat,  
other cities braced for more of the same over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	As the temperature peaked at 104 degrees Friday at Chicago's  
Midway Airport, up to 100,000 homes and businesses began feeling 
the electricity -- along with cool stream of air conditioning -- shut 
off. Power companies blamed excessive demand for the outage. Full 
power was not expected to be restored until later today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a week of temperatures that were just building up  
every day going toward 100 degrees. We're setting peak demand 
records every day,'' said Chicago's Commonwealth Edison spokesman 
Keith Bromery. ``That's put a real strain on the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While other states were able to avoid such problems, utilities  
issued warnings asking consumers to cut back on usage to prevent 
possible outages. 
</P>
<P>
	The heat was so bad in central Arkansas that Danny Mahan, safety  
director for a construction company there, said workers pouring 
concrete have been going to work at about 3 a.m. to avoid the 
afternoon heat. He's been encouraging workers to drink plenty of 
water before they hit the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the younger guys think they can get a drink when it  
starts heating up,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even pro athletes had trouble playing outdoors. In Chicago,  
Jimmy Connors withdrew from a seniors tennis tournament and two 
Cubs players took themselves out of a baseball game with the New 
York Mets because of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to quit. I called the trainer and said, `I can't  
take it,''' Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But the outages were the biggest worry in Chicago Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Several high-rise buildings with elderly were (partially)  
evacuated. Some of our cooling centers were down, and our 311 
number was overwhelmed by calls from people who couldn't get 
through to Commonwealth Edison and they wanted to report the 
outages,'' said city spokesman Terry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	The city also made special efforts to get to the elderly, trying  
to avoid a repeat of the summer of 1995, when more than 700 elderly 
residents died in extreme heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago Police Officer Mike Sanders began the day checking to  
see how senior citizens were faring in the heat. He had to rescue 
81-year-old Mary Powls, lying on the floor of her apartment with 
her windows closed, fan off and no air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders later checked on her in the hospital, where she was  
admitted in stable condition with a 104-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good thing that we came around when we did,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides the elderly, intense heat can also be daunting for the  
homeless, if they have no shelter from the sun's rays. But in 
Louisville, Ky., which hit 106 on Friday, Bill Tracy has managed to 
find some places to keep cool during the day, such as the library. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to keep myself dressed well so I can slip into  
places,'' said Tracy, who goes to a shelter at night.

<HEADLINE> Shrivers Producing NBC Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Bobby Shriver played the politician when  
asked how he and his mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, were getting 
along as producers of the NBC movie ``Mary &AMP; Jesus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We never fight. ... We've had some lively conversations.  
Father Heet mediated them all and heard confession afterward,'' he 
joked. The Rev. Donald Heet is a consultant on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-hour movie, airing Nov. 14, gives the mother of Christ  
her due as a historically important woman, the Shrivers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's a more significant figure than any female in the  
last 2,000 years,'' Mrs. Shriver told the Television Critics 
Association on Friday. ``I think she's had enormous impact all over 
the world ... and she's very timely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Shriver, the sister of President John F. Kennedy, brought  
the idea for ``Mary &AMP; Jesus'' to her son, who has produced TV 
programs and films including Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``True Lies.''

<HEADLINE>  Giants' Johnson Back After Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- LeShon Johnson had a special reason for  
following Lance Armstrong's victory in the Tour de France last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was inspirational story of an athlete who not only overcame  
cancer, but then got back into shape and won cycling's greatest 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson can identify with someone like that.  
</P>
<P>
	Just five months ago, the New York Giants' running back posted  
his victory over cancer. Now the 28-year-old wants his professional 
life back, and he's going through twice-a-days workouts with the 
Giants at the University at Albany to get it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am determined to got out there and show people with the same  
sickness that I had that you can always come back,'' Johnson said 
Saturday. ``Just because I was sick, I didn't throw in the towel 
and say, `Hey, this is it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That might have been easy with the discovery of his lymphoma  
cancer in May 1998. It came just two months after Johnson had left 
the Arizona Cardinals and signed with the Giants as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	While his new teammates were at training camp at this time last  
year, Johnson was preparing to start chemotherapy to treat a 
grapefruit-sized tumor in his chest. Radiation would follow in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	The chemotherapy was bearable. Johnson even worked out during  
his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Radiation lasts five or 10 minutes, and after the first one I  
said, `This is easy,''' Johnson said. ``By the third and fourth 
one, I found myself getting tired. It kicked my butt, but I had to 
keep pushing myself to work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last radiation treatment came on Jan. 27. Johnson doesn't  
hesitate in recalling the date. On Feb. 21, he was diagnosed as 
cancer free. 
</P>
<P>
	After months of workouts, Johnson reported to camp Thursday at  
212 pounds, four over his playing weight. And with starting 
halfback Gary Brown sidelined with an injury resulting from a 
motorcycle accident last month, Johnson is running with the first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	He's also looking to write a story as improbable as Armstrong's.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just to see him back on the field after the year he's had,  
it's good,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``I think he can be an 
inspiration to other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reading about Armstrong's experiences over the past month also  
helped Johnson prepare for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stuff like that pushes you to strive a lot harder to reach a  
goal,'' Johnson, a six-year veteran whose best season was in 1996 
when he gained 634 yards on 141 carries. ``He's a great guy to look 
up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A former bull rider in rodeos, Johnson admitted he's been a  
little fatigued working out in temperatures in the 90-degree range 
the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm prepared to get beat up on and carry the load 25-30 times  
a game,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants aren't going to let that happen right away.  
</P>
<P>
	``After we get through with the preseason, we'll have a better  
indicator,'' offensive coordinator Jim Skipper said. ``It's still a 
little early, but, hey, he's looking the same as he was in Arizona. 
We have to see his endurance.''

<HEADLINE> Superstitious Boggs Nears 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Before the game, before every  
baseball game, Wade Boggs eats chicken and cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, after every game, he downs two hot dogs, a bag  
of barbecue potato chips and an iced tea. 
</P>
<P>
	Between meals, the 41-year-old Tampa Bay Devil Rays third  
baseman follows a ritual that involves scores of superstitions, and 
he's not about to change it as he zeroes in on his landmark 3,000th 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever he's done, it's worked for 23 years. So I figure I'm  
not messing with superstitions,'' says his wife, Debbie. ``I don't 
have any. They're all his.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs leaves home at the same time, 1:47 p.m. for a 7:05 game.  
He runs before each game, at 6:47 for a 7:05 start, at 7:17 for a 
7:35 start. He takes exactly 100 ground balls in warmups. He tries 
on dozens of batting gloves to find a pair that seems right for the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	One time, the scoreboard operator in Toronto advanced the clock  
from 7:16 to 7:18 to try to throw him off his ritual. Boggs ran 
anyway and got two hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you try to interrupt my routine, then sorry,'' says the  
12-time All-Star and five-time American League batting champion. 
``If you can't respect that, then I feel sorry for the person 
trying to upset the routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More parts of the ritual:  
</P>
<P>
	Boggs steps over the foul line when he sprints onto the field  
and steps on it when he returns to the dugout. He never stands on 
the mound during a pitcher's conference. He draws a personal 
good-luck symbol in the dirt before each plate appearance. He 
changes the gum he's chewing when he doesn't get a hit. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't bother asking him to compile a list of his  
superstitions. The 12-time All-Star says it would take too long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why so many? To make the day go by,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had one or two, I wouldn't have anything to do. So I have  
80 or 100 that I go through during the day, and they fall into 
place. I know exactly what I'm going to do along the way. That 
makes me relax and get into a frame of mind that I need to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going hitless in the first two games of Tampa Bay's  
current six-game road trip, Boggs still needs eight hits to reach 
3,000. Ideally, the Devil Rays would like him to reach the plateau 
during a six-game homestand that begins Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs grew up in Tampa, and the chance to get No. 3,000 before  
family and friends was one reason he signed with the expansion team 
after spending 16 seasons with the Boston Red Sox and New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He's being chased to the 3,000-hit mark by San Diego's Tony  
Gwynn, who still needs nine hits after going 0-for-3 against the 
Houston Astros on Friday and 0-for-3 in the rematch Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Barring injuries, they'll be the first players to reach the  
milestone in the same season since Robin Yount and George Brett did 
it three weeks apart in 1992. Only 21 other players have 3,000 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs says it didn't matter who gets there first.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's not going to be an asterisk at the end of my career  
that says, `Tony Gwynn beat Wade Boggs to 3,000.' If he gets there 
first, more power to him. I just want to get there,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The two never considered themselves rivals because they play in  
different leagues. Yet they feel a connection as players who helped 
put line-drive hitters on the map at a time when most young players 
came into the majors wanting to hit home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the blocks with seven straight 200-hit seasons,  
just rolling along,'' Gwynn, the eight-time National League batting 
champion, says of Boggs. ``He was the type of hitter I really 
wanted to be like.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boggs started the season 78 hits short of the 3,000 milestone,  
and he was determined to have fun. He says the hype surrounding the 
chase hasn't been a distraction. The Devil Rays are enjoying the 
ride, too, despite struggling through another last-place season. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Bobby Witt is one of the more than 700 pitchers who  
have given up hits to Boggs. He remembers facing him in Boston and 
nearly being hit in the face by a line drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next thing I know I was upside down,'' says Witt, who's  
pitched 13 seasons in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just watching him hit was amazing. Watching how he was able to  
go out there and get three one night and come back with two the 
next night. He's just a great hitter.''

<HEADLINE> Royals Trade Pitcher Kevin Appier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Kansas City ace Kevin Appier, the  
subject of trade rumors since spring training, was traded Saturday 
night from the Royals to the Oakland Athletics for three young 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals got right-handers Blake Stein, Jeff D'Amico and Brad  
Rigby for the 31-year-old Appier. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was announced during the Royals' game at Texas, about  
2 1/2 hours before the midnight EDT trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in a step-on-the-gas mode,'' Appier said. ``They think  
they've got a good thing going and they're trying to improve their 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland was 3 1/2 games behind Toronto for the wild-card spot. The  
Royals were 42-60 going into Saturday, 20 1/2 games behind AL Central 
leader Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm comfortable with it,'' Appier said. ``I'm glad, but I'm  
not saying that I hate Kansas City or the fans. I'm going to miss 
them and it's not like I'm going to leave the city. We're going to 
to continue to live there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who missed nearly the entire 1998 season because of  
shoulder problems, was 9-9 with a 4.87 ERA. He was 114-89 with a 
3.46 ERA in a major league career that began with Kansas City in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigby, 26, was 3-4 with a 4.33 ERA in 29 relief appearances for  
the Athletics. Stein, 25, was 0-0 with a 16.88 ERA in one start for 
Oakland and D'Amico, 24, was 2-2 with three saves and a 2.81 ERA at 
Triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate Kevin's long and loyal service,'' general  
manager Herk Robinson said. ``However, the Royals organization has 
made a commitment to reducing payroll and taking advantage of 
signing the numerous picks we had in this June's amateur draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Athletics made another trade, sending closer Billy Taylor to  
the New York Mets for pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Greg 
McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to add to the present and future with every deal we  
did,'' Athletics general manager Billy Beane said. ``Kevin has a 
club option. He's still a solid major league starter. He can throw 
200 innings. Each day with our starters we have the ability to 
throw out there, we have a shot to win anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kevin has been a No. 1 and he brings a No. 1 mentality.  
There's a lot of value in that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier said his first start for Oakland would come Monday night  
against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Oakland traded pitcher Kenny Rogers to the Mets, and  
also got pitcher Omar Olivares and infielder Randy Velarde from 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	Set to earn $5.8 million next season in the option year of his  
contract, Appier had long been mentioned in trade talks as the 
cash-strapped Royals embarked on a payroll purge. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we made all these deals, we had a grand plan in mind,''  
Beane said. ``One had to fall in order for the other to fall. This 
is a big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Every time he started during the spring, scouts from at least a  
dozen major league teams were on hand. But he obviously had lost 
velocity and effectiveness and the Royals were not able to make a 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	After a 10-5 loss to Detroit earlier this month when his record  
dipped to 8-9 and his ERA climbed to 5.00, Appier angrily lashed 
out at management and insisted he wanted to play with a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have a great chance to do it,'' he said. ``But if  
ownership and (the) general manager, if that's not their goal, then 
hopefully they'll get rid of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier was asked if he believed management's goal was to fashion  
a playoff contender with younger players. 
</P>
<P>
	``To keep and sign them? That remains to be seen,'' he said.  
``If we're going to be a much-improved team, then I'd like to be 
part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier ranks among the Royals' career top 10 in a number of  
pitching categories, including wins, innings, ERA, starts, complete 
games, shutouts and innings. He is the team's all-time leader in 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right  
shoulder on March 24, 1998, and at the same time doctors trimmed 
some minimally frayed edges of the rotator cuff tendons and 
discovered a fracture line of cartilage in the shoulder socket. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent most of the season on the disabled list and was called  
up to the Royals in September. He finished with a 1-3 record and a 
7.80 ERA and, on Sept. 18, fanned Cleveland's Jim Thome for career 
strikeout No. 1,367, passing Mark Gubicza on the team's career list 
for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	He began to slide in 1997 when he was 9-13 with a 3.40 ERA, his  
first losing record since his rookie season in 1989. His finest 
season may have been 1993 when he was 18-8, finished third in Cy 
Young voting behind Jack McDowell and Randy Johnson and led the AL 
with a 2.56 ERA, becoming the first Royal to do so since Bret 
Saberhagen in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Rash of Slayings Stun Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two decades after the first bodies were found in  
what became known as the Atlanta child murders, violence has once 
again thrust this city into the national eye. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, during a month of bloodshed, few parts of Atlanta  
have been spared: Shootings have struck in the suburbs, the 
inner-city and even in the wealthy Buckhead district. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims have been white, black, Asian, Christian, Jewish,  
Muslim, middle-class, rich, poor, young, old; they have ranged from 
helpless children to SWAT team officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just mind-boggling,'' said Georgia Hall, who lives across  
the street from the house where a July 12 murder-suicide left seven 
dead. ``It's almost unbelievable that these tragedies are just 
happening all together. You get to the point where you wonder 
what's next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That slaying was the worst Atlanta mass killing of the century.  
It held the mark for just 17 days, when it was surpassed by Mark O. 
Barton's shooting spree Thursday in the city's Buckhead commercial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	In July alone, 23 people -- including three gunmen -- have died in  
mass killings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll is apparent on Mayor Bill Campbell, who appeared solemn  
as he recounted the most recent tragedy to reporters and asked the 
nation to pray for his city. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are unspeakable tragedies. From Colorado to Atlanta,  
these things occur. We don't know why,'' Campbell said. ``In the 
span of 10 days, two deranged individuals have killed 17, perhaps 
more. I don't know if there's any explanation for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell has been one of the most vocal proponents of gun  
control, filing one of the first lawsuits by cities against the gun 
industry. But much of the state is pro-gun rights and the Georgia 
Legislature passed a law blocking cities from filing such suits. 
Campbell has said he will challenge the state law in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think he may have more support because of the recent rash  
of shootings. Among the crimes he can point to: 
</P>
<P>
	-- On May 20, 15-year-old T.J. Solomon opened fire on classmates,  
injuring six at Heritage High School in Conyers, just east of 
Atlanta. None of the injuries were fatal. Solomon faces a hearing 
this month to determine if he will be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On July 12 in southwest Atlanta, Cyrano Marks fatally shot his  
live-in girlfriend, her sister and four children -- aged 9 to 16 -- 
before killing himself. Family members said Marks was upset over 
his girlfriend's intent to break up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The only survivor in the house was an 11-year-old Santonio  
Lucas, who hid in a closet for eight hours after being shot in the 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On July 23, a police sniper shot and killed gunman Greg Smith  
while he was trying to escape from police by climbing out a 
bathroom window in an Austell home. Officers said they feared 
Smith, who had wounded one officer and killed two, was a threat to 
them and his elderly mother -- still in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst was yet to come.  
</P>
<P>
	Six days later, the same day one of the officers was buried,  
gunfire transformed the tinted office buildings and neatly 
manicured lawns of Buckhead into a field of chaos and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the nine dead in two day-trading offices, 13 were  
injured before Barton, a chemist turned stock trader, fled to an 
Atlanta suburb and shot himself five hours later as police closed 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tragic year for the metro Atlanta area,'' said Tim  
Brazie, 27, a paramedic who responded to the Buckhead killings and 
the Cobb County police shootings. ``I've never experienced a year 
like this before, not this many tragedies in this short amount of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spate of killings comes exactly two decades after a string  
of violence that began in 1979 and left 29 young blacks dead. The 
killings ended in 1981. Wayne B. Williams was convicted in two of 
the deaths, and police blamed him for 22 others. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are quick to point out that in the current crime  
spree, none of the shootings were connected, and note declining 
crime statistics. Preliminary FBI data showed Atlanta recorded a 
1.6 percent decline in violent crimes from 1997 to 1998. Murders 
dropped by one to 149 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As of July 29, the city has recorded 91 murders compared to 83  
during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of things, unfortunate as they are, can happen  
anywhere,'' Police Chief Beverly Harvard said. ``It doesn't matter 
where you live, it doesn't really matter where you work. This kind 
of tragedy can happen.''

<HEADLINE>  Canadian Athlete Fails Doping Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- An unidentified Canadian athlete  
failed a drug test at the Pan American Games, the host nation's 
Olympic committee confirmed Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Olympic Association would not say which sport was  
involved or when the doping infraction occurred. But the Pan 
American Sports Organization notified the COA that a Canadian 
athlete tested positive for a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	PASO's Medical Commission said it will render a decision Sunday  
on whether a doping infraction occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the first positive test at these games.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. baseball team moved one victory from a spot in the  
Sydney Olympics when it beat Panama 5-2. If it beats Mexico on 
Sunday -- the squad of minor leaguers already did that last Tuesday 
-- it earns a berth in the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what baseball is all about right now,'' said Craig  
Paquette, who homered for the Americans. ``It's a no-lose 
situation. It's something I've never been a part of. Every game is 
a playoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American tennis, softball and soccer players were very stingy,  
and the women's basketball team was anything but, leaving it to the 
men to salvage U.S. pride on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The medals race is a runaway, with the United States at 172 (69  
gold), followed by Canada with 102 (31 gold) and Cuba with 89 (33 
gold). 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was more dominating than 18-year-old tennis phenom  
Alexandra Stevenson, who routed Francine Harvey of Antiqua 6-0, 
6-0. It was her first double shutout since she was a junior in high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevenson, the first woman to make the Wimbledon semifinals as a  
qualifier, has lost two games in four sets. She has spent as much 
time concentrating on collecting pins as on her groundstrokes and 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mainly looking for pins from other countries,'' said  
Stevenson, whose opponent asked for her autograph after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman in action was Lilia Osterloh, who defeated  
Joelle Schad of the Dominican Republic 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Cecil Mamiitt beat Simon Ebelyn of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago 6-3, 6-4;  
Bob Bryan was a 6-1, 6-1 winner of Felix Insaurralde of Paraguay; 
and Paul Goldstein downed Jermaine Smith of Jamaica 7-5, 6-0 in 
men's play. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's world champions in softball got their third straight  
shutout as they beat the Netherlands Antilles 7-0 behind the 
three-hit pitching of Lori Harrigan. In the three games, the 
Americans have outscored their opponents 21-0, allowing only four 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Harrigan, a left-hander, walked only one and struck out nine.  
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime your pitchers go out and don't allow any runs, you  
have to be happy with their performance,'' coach Ralph Raymond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Douty led an 11-hit U.S. attack with two hits and two  
RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. men were just as strong, winning over the Dominican  
Republic 12-0 in six innings. Doug Middleton struck out 16 of 18 
batters and allowed only one hit. 
</P>
<P>
	A 3-0 victory over Canada gave the U.S. women's soccer squad an  
18-1 scoring edge in the preliminary round and first place in its 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team totally stepped up,'' Marcia Wallis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 0-0 tie with weak Uruguay, the American men's soccer  
team also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	In the middle of those strong victories came a poor performance  
from the women's basketball squad, which sustained its worst Pan 
Ams loss ever, 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban women overwhelmed the United States with quickness,  
slashing drives to the basket and a trapping zone defense. They 
jumped to a 14-3 lead in the first five minutes and the Americans 
never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were good, but we know we're a lot better defensive team  
than that,'' forward Lynn Pride said. ``We had a lot of breakdowns. 
We usually rely on our help, but it wasn't there tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No such problems for the U.S. men's squad of CBA all-stars.  
Sparked by the shot-swatting defense of 7-foot Mikki Moore, they 
rolled past Cuba 89-48 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Thomas led the Americans with 17 points. Moore contributed  
seven points, five rebounds and three blocks and generally 
intimidated any Cuban who thought of shooting near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the first half, I had some jitters early,'' Moore said. ``I  
got a few blocks and that got my blood flowing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans won three out of five boxing matches.  
</P>
<P>
	Bantamweight Gerald Tucker, light heavyweight Joe Pastorello and  
light welterweight Corey Bernard easily moved into the second round 
with lopsided victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker, of Cincinnati, romped to a 24-4 win over Cesar Morales  
of Mexico. Pastorello of Colorado Springs, Colo., was an 11-2 
winner against Francisco Garcia of the Dominican. The referee 
stopped Bernard's bout against round Elkena Saunders of the Bahamas 
in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker forced a standing-8 count in the first round and then  
eased to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had so many butterflies before this bout, and then to top  
things off I was the first bout,'' he said. ``I just felt I had to 
continue what was started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans also won their first two bouts on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	The losing U.S. fighters were Ron Siler of Cincinnati, beaten by  
Cuba's Maikros Romero in light flyweight, and lightweight Jason 
Ingwaldson of Henderson, Nev.,who was stopped in the second round 
by Fabricio Nieva of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	John Patterson pitched 5 2-3 hitless innings Saturday night and  
allowed two hits in eight innings. The 6-foot-5 Patterson, a 
Double-A pitcher in the Arizona Diamondbacks' organization, had not 
given up a hit when he fumbled Earl Agnoly's bunt to mound for an 
error with two outs in the sixth. Audes De Leon followed with a 
two-run homer to right for Panama's first hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, which lost its final two baseball games in pool play amid  
rumors of impending defections, beat the Dominican Republic 3-1 as 
Gabriel Pierre Lazo and Luis Ulacia homered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy and now I have the possibility of playing for  
the gold medal,'' Ulacia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada got homers from Jeremy Ware, Ryan Radmanovich, Troy  
Fortin and Andy Stewart to beat Guatemala 12-2 in a game stopped by 
the 10-run mercy rule in the bottom of the seventh when the 
Canadians scored four runs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Clark Not Ousted for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is denying that Army Gen.  
Wesley Clark's prosecution of the war in Yugoslavia had anything to 
do with his removal as NATO's supreme commander. Any suggestion to 
the contrary, Clinton said, is ``wrong. Absolutely wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Pentagon confirmed reports this month that Clark would  
leave his NATO job next May, two months ahead of schedule, it was 
widely reported that he was being pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disturbed about the way (Clark's departure) became  
public,'' Clinton told reporters Friday, during a visit to Bosnia. 
``It opens the way to an inference that is absolutely false.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon and Clinton administration officials explained they  
were acting under legal constraints to allow for the appointment to 
the NATO post of Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, now vice chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. By law, Ralston must get another 
four-star position within 60 days of leaving that job or retire. 
</P>
<P>
	Many NATO commanders have been offered an additional year in the  
job, and speculation mounted about tensions between Clark and his 
superiors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bosnia, Clinton repeated the explanation about the necessity  
for Clark to leave the NATO job two months early to make room for 
Ralston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any inference that it amounts to early retirement or  
dissatisfaction with his service is wrong. Absolutely wrong,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the change is being made because ``there is a need to  
get an equally strong person to come in behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's all this is about,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Rash of Slayings Stun Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Two decades after the first bodies were found in  
what became known as the Atlanta child murders, violence has once 
again thrust this city into the national eye. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, during a month of bloodshed, few parts of Atlanta  
have been spared: Shootings have struck in the suburbs, the 
inner-city and even in the wealthy Buckhead district. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims have been white, black, Asian, Christian, Jewish,  
Muslim, middle-class, rich, poor, young, old; they have ranged from 
helpless children to SWAT team officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just mind-boggling,'' said Georgia Hall, who lives across  
the street from the house where a July 12 murder-suicide left seven 
dead. ``It's almost unbelievable that these tragedies are just 
happening all together. You get to the point where you wonder 
what's next?'' 
</P>
<P>
	That slaying was the worst Atlanta mass killing of the century.  
It held the mark for just 17 days, when it was surpassed by Mark O. 
Barton's shooting spree Thursday in the city's Buckhead commercial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
	In July alone, 23 people -- including three gunmen -- have died in  
mass killings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll is apparent on Mayor Bill Campbell, who appeared solemn  
as he recounted the most recent tragedy to reporters and asked the 
nation to pray for his city. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are unspeakable tragedies. From Colorado to Atlanta,  
these things occur. We don't know why,'' Campbell said. ``In the 
span of 10 days, two deranged individuals have killed 17, perhaps 
more. I don't know if there's any explanation for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell has been one of the most vocal proponents of gun  
control, filing one of the first lawsuits by cities against the gun 
industry. But much of the state is pro-gun rights and the Georgia 
Legislature passed a law blocking cities from filing such suits. 
Campbell has said he will challenge the state law in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think he may have more support because of the recent rash  
of shootings. Among the crimes he can point to: 
</P>
<P>
	-- On May 20, 15-year-old T.J. Solomon opened fire on classmates,  
injuring six at Heritage High School in Conyers, just east of 
Atlanta. None of the injuries were fatal. Solomon faces a hearing 
this month to determine if he will be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On July 12 in southwest Atlanta, Cyrano Marks fatally shot his  
live-in girlfriend, her sister and four children -- aged 9 to 16 -- 
before killing himself. Family members said Marks was upset over 
his girlfriend's intent to break up with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The only survivor in the house was an 11-year-old Santonio  
Lucas, who hid in a closet for eight hours after being shot in the 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	-- On July 23, a police sniper shot and killed gunman Greg Smith  
while he was trying to escape from police by climbing out a 
bathroom window in an Austell home. Officers said they feared 
Smith, who had wounded one officer and killed two, was a threat to 
them and his elderly mother -- still in the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The worst was yet to come.  
</P>
<P>
	Six days later, the same day one of the officers was buried,  
gunfire transformed the tinted office buildings and neatly 
manicured lawns of Buckhead into a field of chaos and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the nine dead in two day-trading offices, 13 were  
injured before Barton, a chemist turned stock trader, fled to an 
Atlanta suburb and shot himself five hours later as police closed 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tragic year for the metro Atlanta area,'' said Tim  
Brazie, 27, a paramedic who responded to the Buckhead killings and 
the Cobb County police shootings. ``I've never experienced a year 
like this before, not this many tragedies in this short amount of 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spate of killings comes exactly two decades after a string  
of violence that began in 1979 and left 29 young blacks dead. The 
killings ended in 1981. Wayne B. Williams was convicted in two of 
the deaths, and police blamed him for 22 others. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials are quick to point out that in the current crime  
spree, none of the shootings were connected, and note declining 
crime statistics. Preliminary FBI data showed Atlanta recorded a 
1.6 percent decline in violent crimes from 1997 to 1998. Murders 
dropped by one to 149 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	As of July 29, the city has recorded 91 murders compared to 83  
during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``These kinds of things, unfortunate as they are, can happen  
anywhere,'' Police Chief Beverly Harvard said. ``It doesn't matter 
where you live, it doesn't really matter where you work. This kind 
of tragedy can happen.''
