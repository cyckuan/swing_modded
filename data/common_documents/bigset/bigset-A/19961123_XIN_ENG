<HEADLINE> Surgery Offers Yeltsin 12 Years of Active Life: Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Heart surgery similar to that
performed on Russian President Boris Yeltsin guarantees a patient
10 to 12 years of "active life," the head of the medical center of
the presidential administration, Sergei Mironov, said today.
</P>
<P>
Mironov told a news conference at the Interfax news agency that
it was not just his personal viewpoint but the opinion of the
leading heart surgeons.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, underwent heart by-pass surgery on November 5th
and was moved from the Central Clinical Hospital to Barvikha
sanatorium outside Moscow this morning, where he will spend two or
three weeks recovering.
</P>
<P>
On Yeltsin's present condition, Mironov said the president is
feeling well and his blood pressure and pulse are stable. The
president's rehabilitation is both cardiological and
psychological, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mironov confirmed that all five shunts on Yeltsin's heart are
functioning normally. "There are no objective factors today
indicating there problems in the functioning of the shunts," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the president's workload, Mironov said Yeltsin
approves his timetable with his aides "but the size of his
workload is still agreed upon with medics."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has been working on documents four to six hours a day
since the fifth day after his heart operation, Mironov said.

<HEADLINE> NATO: Options for Command Structure in Europe Still Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The NATO military authorities
are still holding the options open for restructuring of the
alliance's commands in Europe after the NATO Military Committee
met here today in the Chiefs of Staff session.
</P>
<P>
One of the main aims of the meeting was to select the preferred
command structure, including the number of strategic commands and
regional commands and the types of subregional commands.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference after the meeting, General Klaus
Naumann, chairman of NATO's Military Committee, told reporters
that it was agreed that NATO's two strategic commands, the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Power Europe and the Atlantic Ocean Allied
Command, would remain as it was today, with the latter still
having three regional commands.
</P>
<P>
He said that the meeting proposed to the NATO Council two
alternative solutions for regional commands for Europe, which were
setting up two regional commands (North and South) or maintaining
the North, Center and South commands.
</P>
<P>
But he added that a "clear majority of nations prefer the option
to have two regional commands in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Progress on the reform of NATO's command structure to allow it
to expand eastward has stalled over French and U.S. disagreement
about who should head the key southern command in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is insisting that an American continue to head this
command, in Naples, Italy, while maintaining the two other
regional commands in Europe, in order to put Europeans at their
heads, thus making the greater "europeanization" of NATO more
"visible."
</P>
<P>
But France was strongly of the opinion that the Southern and
Northern Commands in Europe be rotated among the European allies,
threatening that France would halt its process of reconciliation
with NATO if its demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
However, French Defense Minister Charles Millon this week
reportedly toned down France's demand that the U.S. hand over the
southern command to a European, saying it could take time to turn
that principle into reality.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the progress on this French-U.S. dispute at the
meeting, General Naumann replied, "We have reached an unanimous
agreement on proposing the two alternatives."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "We need to know first how many jobs for the
future commands politicians will approve, before we start to
discuss who should get the job, this will be the next phase in the
discussion."
</P>
<P>
The general said it was also agreed that there would be 20
integrated headquarters instead of the current 33 at NATO's future
three command levels.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Chiefs of Staff also put forward
specific recommendations regarding development of the Combined
Joint Task Force concept and the European Security and Defense
Identity as well as the Partnership for Peace program, which
should make it possible to take some definitive decisions during
NATO's autumn ministerial meetings in December.
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs of Staff also discussed the situation in former
Yugoslavia and NATO's military planning for the follow-on
operation in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> France Deplores "Presidential Election" in Nagorno-Karabakh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- France today deplored the plan
to hold a "presidential election" by the self-styled government
of Nagorno-Karabakh on November 24, which Paris said could only
complicate the situation there.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
a negotiated solution to the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh "goes
by the respect of territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the
provision of a status of very large autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh
and the guarantee for this status."
</P>
<P>
The local leader of Nagorno-Karabakh, Robert Kocharian, is the
organizer of the controversial election.
</P>
<P>
Armenian troops have been controlling one fifth of the
territory of Azerbaijan, including Nagorno-Karabakh which is
populated by ethnic Armenians, since the 1992-93 war between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Azerbaijan reached a cease-fire in 1994, but failed
to solve territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
France, together with Russia and the United States, is a member
of the 10-member Minsk Group created by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1992 for solving the
conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> Meeting On Law On Future Stationing Of Troops In Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A meeting was held in
Shenzhen, in Guangdong Province, today to solicit opinions on
drafting a law on stationing troops of the People's Liberation
Army in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were representatives of the Legislative
Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC); legislative bureaus of the Central
Military Commission and the State Council; the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office of the State Council; Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch; and Hong Kong members of the law panel of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong SAR, as well as Hong Kong deputies to
the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Major General Yang Fukun, director of the Legislative Bureau of
the Central Military Commission, who has taken part in drafting
the law, said that the Central People's Government places great
importance on the draft work.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a draft group was especially founded as early
as 1992, and that over the past few years, members of the group
have read through 31 volumes of Hong Kong laws in English, and
more than 100 collections of cases, and have translated and sorted
out more than one-million words.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the group also invited British military law
scholars to explain British Army jurisdiction, and that in the
process of drafting the law, the group also listened to the views
of Hong Kong residents through various channels.
</P>
<P>
In talking about the performance of military and non-military
duties as contained in the draft law, Yang emphasized that these
are not some unique creation but are something that are used by
other countries, including Britain.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the stipulations on jurisdiction in the draft are
in strict accordance with Article 19 of the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Supports Boutros Ghali To Assume Second </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has accused the
United States of being undemocratic by blocking the renewal of
Egyptian Boutros Boutros-Ghali's term of office as United Nations
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe will continue its support for the candidacy of
boutros-ghali despite the U.S. position, Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe said today.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''We are very critical of the Americans. It is
something we cannot accept. How can one nation dictate to the
world like this? The world should read from this lesson... the
practice is not democratic.''
</P>
<P>
The United States this week vetoed a second five-year term for
Boutros-Ghali as U.N. secretary general, accusing him of being
too slow in pushing U.N. refrom. The U.S. even threatened that
his candidacy will further delay U.S. payment of 1.4 billion
dollars it owes to the world body. The other 14 members of the
Security Council voted for him.
</P>
<P>
The three African members of the Security Council, namely
Botswana, Egypt and Guinea-Bissau are consulting with African
states on the way forward.
</P>
<P>
Some African countries have started naming alternative
candidates following a call from the U.S. and the OAU for drawing
up a list of the alternatives.
</P>
<P>
The current thinking among African countries is that an
African should take the second term since past secretaries
general from Europe, Asia and Latin America each held the post
for 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Revises Budget for 1996-97 Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Finance
Minister Nangolo Mbumba has announced to increase the national
budget by 7.5 percent for the 1996/97 financial year, the South
African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly in Windhoek on Thursday,
Mbumba said the original budget for 1996/97 asks for 5,073
million Namibian Dollars (about 1,084 million U.S. Dollars) of
public expenditure, while the revised budget seeks approval for
5,441 million Namibian Dollars (about 1,163 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the revision of 368 million Namibian Dollars
(about 79 million U.S. Dollars) in the budget had been mainly
necessitated by drought and the rise of payments for public
servants.
</P>
<P>
However, Shadow Finance Minister of the opposition Democratic
Turnhalle Alliance, Hans-Erik Staby, said the additional
expenditure in the revised budget reflected financial
indiscipline.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issues Arrest Warrants for Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus police have issued
arrest warrants for six persons in Turkish-controlled northern
areas of the island, in connection with organizing the killing of
unarmed Greek Cypriot Tasos Issac in August during an
anti-occupation demonstration in the U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press conference today, Attorney General
Alecos Markides said that the arrest warrants were communicated
to Interpol Thursday night. Cyprus police asked the international
police force to help in rounding up the six suspects.
</P>
<P>
Issac was savagely beaten to death by extremists in
northern Cyprus on August 11, when he was trapped in barbed
wire in the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) has
controlled the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone across this East
Mediterranean island, which has been divided since Turkish
invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Markides said more persons were involved in the murder but
there was no available evidence as regards their
identity. However, he said police were continuing investigations
to identify the remaining suspects.
</P>
<P>
He said if any one of these persons travels to any country
which Cyprus has a convention to extradite suspects, then the
Cyprus government shall ask to the effect that the said suspect be
 extradited to the island.
</P>
<P>
The six suspects were identified as Hasan Yilmaz, Turkish
settler; Neyfel Mustafa Ergun, 26, Turkish settler; Polat Fikret
Koreli, a 17-year-old Turkish Cypriot; Fikret Veli Koreli,
Polat's father; Mehmet Mustafa Arslan, 41, Turkish settler; and
Erhan Arikli, 40, Turkish settler.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, the Cyprus police issued arrest warrants for
five persons in connection with the premeditated murder of
Solomos Solomou, who was shot and killed on August 14 when
climbing up a flagpole to lower the Turkish flag during a
demonstration to protest against the killing of his relative,
Isaac.

ATHENS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Gypsies in Greece today
declared that they would hold nationwide protests shortly after
the funeral of a Gypsy man shot dead in Livadia, central Greece,
Wednesday by a traffic policeman.

roadblock which had been set up by the police after they received
information that a wanted man was in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
The police officer is being held in custody.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, some 200 Gypsies staged an angry demonstration in
central Athens to protest the killing.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official On Law On Stationing Troops in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Xiaoyang, deputy
director of the Legislative Affairs Commission of China's National
People's Congress Standing Committee, said today in Beijing that
the draft of a law on stationing troops in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is of great significance.
</P>
<P>
It will help the soldiers perform their duties better, he
explained, and help to safeguard state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, as well as help maintain Hong Kong's stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The draft law was drawn up in strict accordance with the
guidelines of the "one country, two systems" policy and the
central government's principles on Hong Kong, and on the basis of
the constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong SAR, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's legal system and British law governing the army
stationed in Hong Kong and concrete practices were also consulted
in the process of drafting the law, he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that stipulations on jurisdiction in criminal cases
involving enlisted personnel and officers are good illustrations
in point of the principle of "one country, two systems". Special
arrangements have been made for troops stationed in the region,
with Hong Kong's conditions in mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
If any enlisted personnel or officers of the People Liberation
Army commit a crime, such as infringing on the rights or property
of Hong Kong residents, when off duty, they will fall under the
jurisdiction of the Hong Kong SAR court or related law enforcement
bodies, he explained.
</P>
<P>
This means that cases that fall under the jurisdiction of the
Hong Kong courts will also be handled by the courts of the SAR,
and that there will absolutely be no lessening of the power of
courts in the future SAR, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also offered explanations of how to deal with civil cases
that involve enlisted personnel or officers who are stationed in
the Hong Kong SAR, and related issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK's Healthy Economy Makes Pound Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The pound sterling climbed to
its highest level for more than four years Thursday as investors
responded enthusiastically to Britain's strong economic growth
with an healthy trade performance.
</P>
<P>
The pound gained more than a cent to 1.6899 U.S. dollars
Thursday, its highest level since October 1992. Its value against
the German mark rose two pfennigs to 2.5330 marks, its highest
since April 1994.
</P>
<P>
It did even better against the French franc, rising from
8.4965 francs. However, French and German leaders were reported to
insist it was correctly valued.
</P>
<P>
It is commonly believed that expectations of higher interest
rates to prevent the economy from overheating helped fuel demand.
</P>
<P>
News of a surge in consumer spending in the third quarter and
signs of inflationary pressure also added to the conviction that
the cost of money will rise before long.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that consumption of goods and services
in Britain increased by 1.1 percent in the third quarter and has
risen by 3.3 percent over the past year -- faster than at any time
since early 1989.
</P>
<P>
The result has been an acceleration in economic activity.
Official statistics confirmed Thursday that the gross domestic
product increased by 0.8 percent in the third quarter against a
rise of 0.5 percent in the second. The annual rate of economic
growth is up from 2.1 percent to 2.4 percent between the quarters.
</P>
<P>
Britain's economy is now growing above its long-term trend
rate, with all sectors benefiting from the upturn. The latest
figures show that manufacturing output rose by 0.7 percent in the
third quarter, almost matching the 0.9 percent rise in services.
</P>
<P>
Britain's overseas performance has not been effected by the
strong pound. Figures published Thursday reveal that the current
account was 792 million pounds (1267.2 million U.S. dollars) in
surplus in the second quarter against previous estimates of a 457
million pound (731.2 million dollar) surplus and a first quarter
deficit of 1.28 billion pounds (2.048 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Angela Knight, the Treasury economic secretary, said, "This is
the best performance in 10 years. It confirms the UK as a strong
international trading country."
</P>
<P>
However, business leaders are concerned about the strong pound
which could have a negative effect on Britain's competitiveness,
because a strong pound makes British goods relatively unattractive
in world markets by making exports more expensive and imports
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Company chiefs have begun to signal cuts in corporate
profitability and press for government action to curb a rise in
the pound of more than 12 percent in coming months.
</P>
<P>
Adair Turner, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, said Thursday, "Many businesses have been telling us
anecdotally for the last couple of weeks that they do feel that
the exchange rate is getting to a level where it could have a
significant effect upon competitiveness both on exports and on
import penetration."
</P>
<P>
Harvey McGrath, managing director of ED/F Man Group, warned his
investors, "If spot rates stay at this sort of level over the next
five months, there will be a 3 percent reduction in reported
earnings at the full year."
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that profits at many of Britain's leading
manufacturers and exporters are expected to be cut by around 2-4
percent because of the rapid appreciation of the pound.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, economic analysts here suggest that,
with consumer spending growing strongly and indicators of
inflation rising, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke should avoid adding to
demand by cutting taxes in his budget next week.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Continues to Recover: CBI Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing is
continuing to recover as demand for goods made in UK factories is
at its best since August last year, boosted by brisk retail sales,
according to a survey published today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly trends survey, the Confederation of
British Industry (CBI) shows that 24 percent of the 1,100
companies polled say their order books are above normal, and the
same proportion below normal, a net balance of zero percent.
</P>
<P>
This compares with negative net balances of 9 percent in the
previous two monthly surveys, and bigger negative figures before
that, and is the most positive figures recorded since August 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, export orders remain weak, with a net minus 5 percent
of firms reporting orders to be below normal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of firms expecting domestic prices to
rise over the next four months outstrips that forecasting price
drops by 8 percent, up from 7 percent in October, sending some
warning signals about inflation.

<HEADLINE> Britain Provides to Tanzania 13.8 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Kingdom has
given 8.3 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 13.8 million U.S.
Dollars) to support the on-going civil service retrenchment
program in the country.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to that effect was signed here recently by the
acting British High Commisioner to Tanzania, Alan Jones and the
Principla Secretary in the Tanzanian Ministry of Finance, Peter
Ngumbulu.
</P>
<P>
The funds which have been transferred to the Bank of Tanzania
will be used to meet the cost incurred by the Treasury in
retrenching 12,800 workers whose employment was terminated last
June.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the British High Commission made available to
Xinhua today said the contribution relected Britain's commitment
to Tanzania's civil service reform program. Further contributions
were planned, added the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, British aid to Tanzania last year
totalled 17 Billion T.Shs. (about 28.3 million Dollars), and for
this year it is expected to rise to about 42 billion T.Shs.
(about 70 million Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Funds Raised to Send African Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 22 (Xinhua) -- A fund to finance the
deployment of African troops who will join the multinational
force in the troubled central African Great Lakes has been
established, Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe said here today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions by journalists on the role of the
southern African region in tackling the refugee crisis in eastern
Zaire, Mugabe said many African countries had failed to finance
their own peace-keeping troops as required by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We sent a message to the U.N. that the African force needs
resources and Canada, as leader of the multinational force, is
consulting with other volunteers for more funds for the African
force," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"A fund has now been built but as to whether this is adequate
or not we do not know," he said, adding that African countries
would send troops to operate either under the command of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) or led by Canada.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe will be ready to send some troops if we can get the
funding," said Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> US Northwest Storms Lead 12 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Severe ice storms that
slashed the northwestern states of the United States this week
caused at least 12 deaths and left thousands of people without
power, The New York Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The worst storms in 60 years that stated Monday knocked out
power to 80,000 to 100,000 customers in Washington and Oregon
states, caused mudslides and damaged highways.
</P>
<P>
Four people died Monday when a mudslide in southwestern Oregon
swept away a home when they were inside. Another person was found
dead in her car which was swallowed by another mudslide.
</P>
<P>
In Washington state, five deaths were reported in road
accidents or in home which was crushed by trees.
</P>
<P>
Many people have to spend nights in shelters provided by the
Red Cross. At least 12 house fires broke out, leading to two
deaths and seven poisoned by carbon monoxide when they were
burning fires in homes.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that about 48,000 customers in the Spokane
area in east Washington continued to struggle Thursday without
power as the National Weather Service forecast up to four inches
of new snow today.
</P>
<P>
Power officials expected restoration of power to all customers
in five to six days.

<HEADLINE> Largest Tax Fraud Case Cracked in New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Law enforcement officials
announced Thursday that they had cracked a tax fraud case which
was described as the largest in the history of the New York City
Government.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine people involved in the scheme have been arrested,
and three of them were present or past city employees, the New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that they expected to track down and arrest as
many as 200 more who paid bribes.
</P>
<P>
The scheme defrauded the city of 20 million U.S. dollars,
including 13 million dollars in real estate tax bills that were
erased from the Finance Department computer and 7 million dollars
in interest on that sum, the report quoted investigators as
saying.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for bribes from property owners, city workers who
took part in the scheme made it appear as if the unpaid taxes had
been paid, officials said. In other cases, legitimate taxpayers'
payments were misapplied to the accounts of bribe-paying property
owners, they added.
</P>
<P>
"What we discovered is a systematic scheme by a handful of city
employees who became computer hackers and used city computers to
electronically pickpocket the city of New York out of millions and
millions and millions of dollars," said Frank Maas, the acting
commissioner of the city's Department of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry began in late 1994 when the Department of
Investigation learned of suspicious transactions between Finance
Department employees and landlords who owned the real estate in
the city.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
urged the Serbian authorities to ensure that the allegations of
irregularities in the conduct of the local elections in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) are seriously investigated.
</P>
<P>
The EU made the appeal in a declaration in response to the
opposition's allegations of irregularities in the conduct of the
elections in a number of municipalities, particularly in the town
of Nis, in the FRY.
</P>
<P>
It also insisted that the re-run of the elections in the areas
identified by the electoral commission should be conducted in full
accordance with international democratic norms, including full
access by all political parties to electoral offices and voter
lists.
</P>
<P>
Compliance with these norms is a key factor in the development
of the FRY's relationship with the EU, the declaration said, adding
that a good number of the local election results in urban centers
have been set aside and will be re-run in a third round of voting.

UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended that the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) supervising the cease-fire
between Israel and Syria be extended for another six months until
May 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a report available today, Boutros-Ghali noted that despite
the present quiet in the Israeli-Syrian sector, the situation in
the Middle East continues to be potentially dangerous and is
likely to remain so.
</P>
<P>
The UNDOF, which was established by the Security Council in May
1974 to supervise the cease-fire and the agreement on
disengagement between Israeli-Syrian forces of May 31, 1974, has
continued to perform its functions effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the prevailing circumstances, Boutros-Ghali considers the
continued presence of the UNDOF in the area to be essential.
</P>
<P>
At present, athe UNDOF comprise about 1,000 troops from
Austria, Canada, Japan and Poland.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also drew attention to the serious
shortfall in the funding of the U.N. force as the unpaid

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects Declaration on Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today described the declaration by the
Palestinians on the establishment of a Palestinian state as a
violation of the bilateral peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting this afternoon,
Netanyahu said "any declaration of a Palestinian statehood would
be a serious mistake," but adding that Israel was ready for it.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks were responding to a question by Moshe
Katsav, deputy prime minister and minister of tourism, about the
Palestinian initiative in the U.N. to go beyond self-determination
toward recognition as an independent state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister David Levy also commented that such a step by
the Palestinians would harm the peace process, adding that his
ministry has already begun diplomatic contacts to block such a
declaration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser
Arafat stressed today that once the interim period of the
Oslo accords is over within two years, he would declare a
Palestinian State.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to Europe One radio station, Arafat also
charged that Israel's demands in Hebron are not aimed at beefing
up security, but rather to set precedent to change situations
regarding other cities under PNA control.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, Israel and the Palestinians
should have started final status talks last May, and the
negotiations are due to be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that as the negotiations on the Israeli
army's redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron went into a
deadlock, the implementation of the interim agreement is not in
sight.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said here
today that about 300 Burundi returnees were killed in a deliberate
massacre that occurred late last month.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in
Burundi (HRFOB) Thursday after a visit to Cibitoke province. The
U.N. officials talked with both local people and authorities
including the military.
</P>
<P>
The HRFOB ascertained that on the night of October 22/23, 258
people were killed by gun shots and hand grenades in the Murambi
Church in the Buganda commune in the province, while 110 others
were wounded, of whom 40 died later.
</P>
<P>
These victims were found Burundi refugees back from Zaire or
Tanzania. In Rwanda, where over 500,000 ethnic Hutu refugees have
returned from eastern Zaire, no arrests or killings of them by the
Tutsi-led government have so far been reported by humanitarian
observers.
</P>
<P>
Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces are areas in Burundi where there
occurs considerable confrontation between rebel forces and the
government, and to which humanitarian workers have extremely
limited access. Last week, the HRFOB conveyed the UN's serious
concern to authorities in Bujumbura that returnees were being
channeled into the two provinces.
</P>
<P>
At present, the HRFOB consists of five human rights observers.
The Commissioner for Human Rights said today that there is a clear
need for 100 observers in Burundi and the commissioner has
appealed for initial funding to support 35 observers. In Rwanda,
there are about 107 U.N. humanitarian observers.

LUSAKA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Election Commission
announced here today that the elections held on Monday are free
and fair.
</P>
<P>
Making the remarks, Commission Chairman Judge Bobby Bwalya
described the elections as peaceful.

But some opposition parties and non-governmental organizations
have dismissed the elections as fraudulent. The opposition

After President Frederick Chiluba won the Monday elections,
former president Kenneth Kaunda vowed to make the country

</P>
<P>
Kaunda was barred from running for the presidency by a

that his government will thwart any uprising without delay and
the army and other security forces are on alert.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Disputed Agenda Troubles WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 22 (Xinhua) -- Two weeks off from the WTO
ministerial conference in Singapore, controversy remains over what
the meeting wants to achieve after the preparatory meeting here
today, raising doubts about the upcoming summit's capability to
produce any substantive results.
</P>
<P>
After one-year preparations, trade officials today failed again
to resolve their discord over the summit agenda. It now seems that
the issue will have to be left to trade ministers to tackle in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
At the biennial meeting, trade ministers from 125 members of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) are expected to review the
WTO's record, especially implementation of the mammoth Uruguay
Round world trade accords, and to map out WTO's the future work,
over which developed and developing countries are widely divided.
</P>
<P>
Only three years after the conclusion of the eight-year-long
Uruguay Round, the majority of WTO members generally have no
appetite for the new multilateral talks in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the 1994 Marrakech conference set in effect
a "built-in agenda," with participants agreeing to hold further
negotiations and reviews in the next few years in sectors
including services, agriculture, textiles and intellectual
property protection.
</P>
<P>
Some observers believe this "built-in agenda" may in practice
develop into a fully-fledged new round.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Western trading powers have been making
additional free trade moves. The United States is seeking action
in Singapore to increase transparency in government procurement,
while the European Union (EU) wants talks on competition policies,
and on a pact setting multilateral rules for investment.
</P>
<P>
The EU even expects the conference to be a launch pad for a new
round of global trade negotiations by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Most controversially, both want the WTO meeting to discuss the
link between trade and labor standards.
</P>
<P>
These demands face fierce opposition from developing countries.
They want the WTO summit to avoid new issues and focus on
implementing the Uruguay Round accords. In particular, they urge
the U.S. and the EU to live up to their commitments to phase out
the textile quota.
</P>
<P>
Almost all developing countries are strongly against discussing
labor standards, saying that the issue is being used by
industrialized countries as a pretext to practise new forms of
protectionism.
</P>
<P>
Even the U.S. and the EU are split over inclusion of investment
issue in the Singapore agenda. The U.S. deems the Organization for
Economic and Cooperation Development the best arena to conclude
the investment pact, fearing that the WTO-sponsored talks might
impair the high standard they intend to set for liberalizing and
protecting investment.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, especially India, Malaysia and Indonesia,
oppose bringing the issue into the WTO, in the belief that an
investment accord will limit their power to channel foreign
capitals according to national development objectives.
</P>
<P>
Other issues agreed to be discussed in Singapore include trade
and environment, relations between multilateral trading systems
and regional trade arrangements as well as the admission of new
members.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, the U.S., the EU, Japan and Canada also plan to
lobby support for concluding a deal to repeal tariffs on
information products including semiconductors, computers, software
and telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
Another goal of the Singapore summit is to further push forward
the WTO-sponsored telecom talks, with some countries possibly
presenting revised offers for broader market access.
</P>
<P>
The summit will last five days and many people are suspicious
about its capability to make substantive progress on so many
issues. Experts say the wrangle about the agenda well mirrors the
difficult aspect of the reality facing the multilateral trading
system, resulting from the different development levels of WTO
members.
</P>
<P>
Fresh liberalization moves proposed by developed countries have
gone beyond the mere reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers
as in the past, but have touched upon countries' regulatory
policies. Developing countries are just far from ready for that.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the benefits from globalization, developing
countries meanwhile have good reasons to fear loss of control over
their national economic development and the pace of their
integration into the global trading system.
</P>
<P>
How to strike a balance between the interests of developed
countries and those of developing countries is believed to be the
key factor determining what and how much can be achieved at the
Singapore trade summit.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Recommends Four-month Renewal of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended on Friday a four-month renewal
of a 23-member U.N. observer mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, the Secretary-General
said the entrenched hostility and mistrust continue to pose a
threat to the peace process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the leaders of the factions to put aside their
differences for the sake of peace in their country and to use the
political process, instead of military means, to promote the
interests of the people they claim to represent.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observer mission was sent to Liberia with the mandate
of helping a much larger peacekeeping force led by Nigeria in
maintain a ceasefire and overseeing the disengagment of forces.
</P>
<P>
Also in the report, the Secretary-General said he intends to
deploy additional 11 military observers in the coming weeks,
bringing the strength of UNOMIL's military component to 34
observers.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the deployment of any additional
military observers to Liberia will depend on progress in the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> UN to Extend Its Force in Former Yugoslav Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali recommended a six month extension of the
mandate of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force
(UNPREDEP) in former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In a report available here today, Boutros-Ghali said that peace
and stability in this country are intimately linked to the overall
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
"While much progress has been achieved there since the signing
of the Dayton Agreement, it is clear that the international
community's political and military involvement in the former
Yugoslavia will of necessity continue for some time in order to
consolidate peace and security," the report said.
</P>
<P>
UNPREDEP, which was established by the Security Council
resolution 983 on March 31, 1995, comprise 1050 troops and 35
military observers. There are also 25 police monotors and civilian
component of 168 persons.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of UNPREDEP, deriving from that of the previous
U.N. Protection Force, was to prevent conflicts elsewhere in the
former Yugoslavia from spilling over or threatening the country.
As recent developments in the regions have made such a scenario
more remote, it has become increasingly evident that the primary
threat to the country's stability may come from internal political
tensions, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, UNPREDEP has accordingly devoted considerable
attention to strengthening dialogue between the political forces
and has assisted in monitoring human rights and inter-ethnic
relations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali recommended that the mandate of the force should
be extended for a further six months to coming May 31 with a
phased reduction of the military component by 300.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Sets Building of Equality in Culture a Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said he regarded the building of "equality of chances in
culture" for every French citizen as a priority of his seven-year
presidential term.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Le Figaro daily to be published on
Saturday, Chirac said that it was essential to promote "the
culture for all, and the idea of making each child a future
citizen of the same cultural heritage."
</P>
<P>
The interview was given on the eve of the entombing of the
ashes of former minister of culture, writer and thinker, Andre
Malraux, to the Pantheon in Paris on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"To develop the feeling of belonging to the national
community, by culture, by civic instruction, by transmission of
values, it is to give each child the intellectual, moral, and
psychological arms which will allow him find his place and go his
way," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that to bring together different cultural communities
in France, the only possible way is to promote the values of the
republic and nation of France, instead of those of individual
cultures and religions.
</P>
<P>
The president said that social disparity has a lot to do with
cultural identity, and separation of one French language into
different usages, terms and ways of expression exclusively
belonging to different social groups would result in the
appearance of ghetto cultures in France.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also called for the strengthening of the French language
in international communications and international cultural fields,
and contributing to the finding of a European way of existence in
the present world.
</P>
<P>
"France will open, extend to the outside world, instead of
folding up in its corner," he said.

<HEADLINE> Disarmament of Warring Factions Begins in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force in Liberia known as ECOMOG today began the process of
disarming combatants from the various factions at sites across
the country.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) said here
this evening that the exercise began in the capital of Monrovia
despite delays caused by the late arrival at the disarmament
sites.
</P>
<P>
"The fighters are waiting in queues before being called up,
registered and disarmed," said the report, adding that the
disarmed fighters can expect immediate disarmament benefits.
</P>
<P>
Surrendered today are set to be queues of rifles and artillery
pieces, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted ECOMOG commander, Nigeria's Major-general
Victor Malu, as saying that he is satisfied with the progress so
far.
</P>
<P>
According to the NTA report, the United Nations Observer
Mission in Liberia has issued a statement, saying that attention
should be focused on the 15,000 child fighters, who should be
disarmed and demobilized into the community.
</P>
<P>
Radio stations and newspapers across Monrovia have been urging
fighters to remain calm and stay committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace accord signed by warring factions in
Abuja, capital of Nigeria, last August, disarmament and
demobilization of some 60,000 combatants should begin today and
be finished on January 31, 1997. Elections will be carried out
next May.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord is aimed to bring to an end the country's
more than six-year-old civil war, in which 150,000 civilians have
been killed, including 50,000 children.

In addition to helping enterprises find a way out of their
predicaments, the city government also organizes job training for
redundant laborers and recommends them to companies in need of
help. It also collects employment information for job-seekers, and
asks them to register for possible contacts.
</P>
<P>
Labor departments have established 10 self-support bases to
make full use of unemployed technicians' professional skills, and
favorable policies have been made to encourage jobless people to
open their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Changsha thinks it can find jobs for 15,000 of the
un-employed.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still difficulties, because many job-seekers
are too picky in looking for a job, and there is still a long way
to go in changing job-seekers' outmoded notions about finding
jobs, according to an official in charge of the re-employment
project.
</P>
<P>
The government provides unemployment benefits temporarily for
jobless people every month, although it is in serious financial
difficulties itself. Recently, it stepped up collection of old-age
insurance payments to increase the amount of finances available
for its re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
Municipal government leaders themselves often call on workers
who are facing difficulties and give them some help.
</P>
<P>
A woman worker wrote to Qin Guangrong, a government leader, to
tell him about the difficult life she was leading. Qin made a
donation himself, immediately, and other government officials
pitched in to help the poor woman.

<HEADLINE> Participant On Draft Law On Stationing Troops in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- An expert taking part in
drafting the law on stationing troops in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) said today that the draft reflects the
"one country, two systems" principle, and will guarantee that
troops act in accordance with Hong Kong's laws.
</P>
<P>
The remark came at a meeting on the draft, where he went on to
say that there are stipulations that clarify a number of major
issues, including the troops' duties and responsibilities, the
relationship between the troops and the Hong Kong SAR government,
and who exactly has jurisdiction over military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The draft accords fully with the Basic Law, he noted, and said
it provides a more detailed explanation of Basic Law stipulations,
such as when the Basic Law says that troops shall abide by the
laws of the Hong Kong SAR, apart from national laws. On this point,
the draft says that military personnel cannot get involved in any
political, religious, or social organizations, or engage in
profit-making activities, or any other activities incompatible
with their obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft also stipulates what the troops' duties are in
helping maintain social order and security, helping with disaster
relief work, and the power of jurisdiction over them, he added,
pointing out that after July 1, 1997, the troops stationed in Hong
Kong and the SAR government will not interfere with each other's
work, or be subordinate, one to the other.
</P>
<P>
Because there are many instances when they will be in contact
with each other, it is essential that there be stipulations on the
relation of the troops to the SAR government, he noted, explaining
that the draft clearly defines the troops' duties and
responsibilities, which are confined strictly to defence, and that
they can never interfere in Hong Kong affairs.
</P>
<P>
This reflects the central government's sincerity in
implementing the "one country, two systems" policy and in
maintaining a high-degree of autonomy, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He has been involved in drafting the law from the beginning,
and says that, in response to a repeated request from the British
side, Chinese experts have informed them of the basic contents of
the draft, and that British experts have on the whole been
positive in their assessment of it.
</P>
<P>
He also said that drawing up the law on garrisoning troops is
China's own affair, and that it will not tolerate interference by
others.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that, with the participation of the
people of Hong Kong, the draft will be further improved and
enriched, on the basis of the "one country, two systems" principle
and the Basic Law, further before it is adopted.

HANGZHOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Provincial People's

According to the new law, all individuals, legal persons and

land-use rights in the city through public bidding and auction,
for purposes of better land development and management.

<HEADLINE> PLA Troops In Hong Kong Not To Act Spontaneously In Relief Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior legislator of
China's National People's Congress, said here today that troops of
the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in Hong Kong
will not be allowed to take part spontaneously in disaster-relief
work.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, deputy director of the Legislative Affairs
Commission of the NPC Standing Committee, made the statement at a
meeting on the Law on Stationing Troops, where he said that troops
stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region "must
strictly abide by the Basic Law and the Law on Stationing of
Troops.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the PLA is the Chinese people's own army, he said
that when a disaster occurs in interior areas, its men can take
prompt action to involve themselves in combating the disaster or
doing relief work.
</P>
<P>
However, after July 1, 1997, he noted, "even if there is an
unexpected catastrophe in Hong Kong, members of the resident
troops cannot take part in disaster-relief work spontaneously, as
they do in the interior areas."
</P>
<P>
Those troops in Hong Kong, he went on, can take part in
disaster-relief work only after the SAR government submits a
request to the central government and receives orders from the
Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
And their actions should be coordinated by the SAR government
and return to their barracks as soon as they accomplish the task,
Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
Qiao explained that this part of the Law on Stationing Troops
is based on the fact that the troops only play an assisting role
in maintaining security in the SAR and in helping disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
A key point in the regulation is that a high degree of autonomy
of the SAR be maintained and that the "one country, two systems"
policy be fully implement, Qiao said.

CHANGSHA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on the jobless
situation in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, where many
residents have lost their jobs in recent years, a municipal
official said, "Without sufficient employment opportunities, we
cannot have a stable society and people's lives cannot improve."
</P>
<P>
At a fair organized by the city's Municipal Labor Bureau, Luo
Gang, a textile mill worker who could hardly make ends meet, was
able to find a job in a hotel. After a training and probation
period, she managed to sign contract with the hotel.
</P>

"I'm satisfied with my work and the 500 yuan salary," she said,
and wrote to the local news media to thank the government for the
help during her very difficult period of time.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a number of factories in Changsha have had to
stop production or cut it in half, putting many workers in
difficult situations.
</P>
<P>
Since the first month of the year, the Municipal Government has
tried everything it could to find new employment opportunities for
the jobless. It has provided financial advice for factories with
difficulties to improve their management, and has helped them find
new markets.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of factories that suffered losses in the first
three quarters of this year was down 10.4 percentage points,
compared to the same period of 1995.

HAIKOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hainan Provincial Zhu Xi
Research Institute was opened today in Haikou, capital of the
island province.
</P>
<P>
A symposium on the philosophy of Zhu Xi, an outstanding
thinker, philosopher and educator who had great influence on
Chinese thought, was held to mark the opening.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, a representative of the Confucian school in the Song
Dynasty (960-1279), exercised the greatest influence in feudal
times after Confucius and Mencius. He held that all things in the
universe were determined by "reason", which had existed before all
things. The "Collection of Annotations for the Four Books" he
compiled became a required textbook for reading stipulated by
later feudal rulers. Zhu is a native of Longxi county, Fujian
province.
</P>
<P>
Present at the event today were more than 100 experts and
scholars from the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong,
as well as some descendants of Zhu Xi. His descendents can be
found throughout the world, with more than 150,000 living in the
ROK.
</P>

Those present said they will work to apply Zhu's teachings to
develop traditional Chinese culture, to contribute to human
progress and social development.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Community in Germany to Double in 2030: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of foreigners living
in Germany will double to 13 million by 2030, accounting for 18.4
percent of the total population, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
While the average number of children born to women of child
bearing age is expected to remain static at 1.3 over the next 30
years, the foreign population will increase by 190,000 annually in
the first 30 years of the next century, a report by Professor
Rainer Muenz from Humboldt University, Berlin, forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that from 1969 to 1994, an average of
170,000 foreigners immigrated to Germany each year, but that
average accelerated to 300,000 a year between 1986 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Since most immigrants of non-German descent choose to live in
major cities, the report said, foreign communities will exceed
half of the population in some metropolitan areas, such as
Frankfurt and Munich.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called on the government to take measures to deal
with the problems brought about by the increasing presence of
foreigners in major communities.

HANGZHOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang province in east
China will promote several scenic sites, travel routes and tourism
festivals next year as part of Visit China '97, with two
outstanding sites, West Lake in Hangzhou and the ancient city of
Shaoxing, getting special attention.
</P>
<P>
West Lake, with its jade-green water and numerous natural
attractions, is known as the most beautiful lake in
China. Shaoxing is famous for cultural relics, such as Orchid
Pavilion, where the classical calligrapher Wang Xizhi did his
writing, and Wupengchuan, small boats with black awnings that can
be found on the little rivers crisscrossing the city. It is also
hometown to Lu Xun, one of the best known writers and thinkers of
modern China.
</P>
<P>
Four special travel routes will include well-known Buddist
temples, a visit to farmers around lakes and rivers in the west
part of the province, an ancient town whose main industry is silk,
and one allowing students to get a glimpse of folk customs in
cities like Hangzhou and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang will also hold several tourism festivals next year,
including the eve of New Year's Day at Jingci Temple in Hangzhou,
an ancient city festival in Shaoxing, a carnival in Hangzhou to
celebrate the return of Hong Kong sovereignty, the first
International Festival for Traditional Cultures in Hangzhou, and
the annual China International Festival for Viewing the Waves on
Qiantang River.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 672,700 overseas tourists visited Zhejiang, bringing
236 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Japan was the biggest
source of tourists, followed by Singapore, South Korea, the United
States, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Germany
and France; 54.47 percent were from other countries, and 22.38
percent from Taiwan, and 19.4 percent from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang had 498,000 overseas tourists from January to
September of this year, earning 166 million US dollars in foreign
exchange, 20.6 percent more than for the same period of last

<HEADLINE> Cyprus wants to Play Role in Balkans, Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides stressed here today that Cyprus and Greece can play an
important role in the Balkans and Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a workshop on foreign policy matters,
President Clerides said that changes in the Balkan region and the
Middle East have not only created hopes for improved ties among
countries in the area but also posed "serious dangers for peace
in the wider region."
</P>
<P>
"Cyprus and Greece can and must play an important role in
shaping a political chart of new alliances and balance of powers
aimed at progress and welfare of the people of the region, under
conditions of stability, security and peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the President explained, international law
and the rule of law must be applied to minimize risks and protect
the rights of all people, including hellenism.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "world politics needs additional morality and
justice, more than anything else."
</P>
<P>
"Peace and prosperity will be dealt with a serious blow,
should the will of the more powerful nations be imposed on weaker
nations," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Clerides pointed out, subscribes to a policy of
promoting the rule of law with conviction, patience and
determination.
</P>
<P>
"This policy consists of finding a Cyprus solution through
negotiations on the basis of U.N. resolutions and high level
agreements (providing for a bicommunal, bizonal federation) and
of pressing for membership of the European Union (EU)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The President also noted that a joint defense dogma, agreed
with Greece in November 1993 to provide military support in the
event of foreign offensive, gives Cyprus increased security and a
better negotiating position.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides said
Cyprus' foreign policy looks to the future and aims at
establishing a free and united Cyprus under conditions of peace,
security and progress.
</P>
<P>
"The effectiveness of our foreign policy is inevitably linked
to developments around the globe, where nothing is static and
changes take place at an alarming rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Cyprus problem, Michaelides said any fresh initiative will
have to adopt an overall approach and focus on the crucial
aspects, including security.
</P>
<P>
He called on the EU to show more involvement in Cyprus' peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Nearly One Million People Homeless in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Nearly one million people in
Germany, including 50,000 children, are homeless and most of them
are facing a cold winter sleeping rough on the streets, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
To make the situation worse, many of the country's 920,000
homeless are suffering from chronic diseases, a conference on
poverty and health in Berlin was told on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Among the growing army of poor, children are accounting for a
larger proportion than before. Statistics show that one in every
five German children are living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Children are often reduced to poverty after their parent(s)
lose their jobs or get divorced. The jobless rate now stands at a
record post-war high of 10.6 percent and is over 15 percent in
some parts of the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
With the divorce rate climbing, more children are living in
single-parent families, usually with low income.
</P>
<P>
Today, 20 percent of German families are single-parent and
children in 30 percent of these families live in poverty,
according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Friday's conference called on the government and society to pay
more attention to the homeless and provide help for them.

<HEADLINE> Angola Plans To Revive 30 Percent of Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUNDA, Novewber 23 (Xinhua) -- Angola's first priority for
1997 is to make 30 percent of its industrial production capacity
revived, Angolan Minister of Industry Manuel Duque said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Duque told a press conference that in 1997, Angola will
try to creat 10,000 jobs in the industrial sector and to set up
an industrial information centre to promote the country's
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The targets the industrial sector set for itself next year
also include the establishment of two industrial development
centres in Luanda and the central city of Benguela and
strengthening the role of the industrial sector which it should
play in the realization of the national industrization, he said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Angola's industrization plan will be
achieved in two stages, work should be done during the first
stage to make production of all the companies resumed, and in the
second stage, efforts should be focused on the establishment of
an Angolan national industry.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the status quo of the Angolan industry,the
minister told that 20 years civil war in Angola has destroyed
almost all the Angolan national industries. At present, the
industrial sector can only contribute five percent to the
country's GDP, as against 20 percent during the years prior to
the war.

MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen said here today that the meeting between Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton scheduled for Sunday
will be an important event in the Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with ministers of other
APEC members, Qian said that he believes the meeting will be a
success.
</P>
<P>
Both President Jiang and President Clinton are to attend the
informal leadership conference in Subic, some 80 kilometers north
of Manila, Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the participation of Chinese Taipei's representative in the
informal meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC),
Qian said that Chinese Taipei was admitted into APEC not as a
sovereign member but a regional economy.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a consensus reached by all APEC members," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, Chinese Taipei is only allowed to send
economic officials to attend the informal APEC leadership
conference.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on a Washington Post report that China
recently shipped chemical weapons to Iran, Qian said the
spokesperson of the U.S. State Department has already denied the
report.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Washington Post often makes inaccurate
reports.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said that Hong Kong will continue to be a full member
of APEC under the name of "Hong Kong, China" after China resumes
the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Rally Held To Condemn Racism In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in Sydney
turned out to condemn Independent MP Pauline Hanson and Prime
Minister John Howard in an anti-racism march through the city's
streets today.
</P>
<P>
At first, up to 3,000 gathered to hear speeches at the Town
Hall Square in the city center, then, by the time the subsequent
march ended in front of the prime minister's office at Philip
Street, the crowd had swelled to almost 6,000, despite heavy rain,
 the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Hanson, Howard, racist cowards" and "Deport Hanson
not refugees" and waving banners bearing messages such as "Asians
welcome, kick out the racists", the rally was strongly
multicultural.
</P>
<P>
Hanson, an Independent MP from Queensland, made a speech in
early September at the Parliament in which she claimed Australia
was in danger of being "swamped with Asians".
</P>
<P>
Speakers included representatives of Vietnamese, Koreans, East
Timorese and Aboriginal communities, and of trade unions, students
and other groups, as well as Labor politicians.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor of Sydney Henry Tsang told reporters that there
was great concern in Sydney's Asian community over racist
outpourings in recent weeks, "I have received messages and phone
calls telling me that when members of the Asian community are
traveling on trains, they are being spat on and insulted. Even in
a good area like Double Bay, visitors and tourists are being
thrown at with eggs."
</P>
<P>
"The community, especially the weaker ones, are scared and they
know that people like me who were elected, are getting death
threats and hate mails", he added.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister was not in Sydney to see the protest, he is
currently attending the APEC summit in Manila.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Irish Firms Favor Joining EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority of
Irish businesses favor Ireland joining the European single
currency, The Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC)
said in a survey.
</P>
<P>
But the vast majority of Irish companies are unprepared for
entry into European Monetary Union (EMU), which involves Europe
moving to a single currency.
</P>
<P>
According to the IBEC, the situation is "far from ideal" and it
called for "compensating improvements" in the business environment
to ensure Irish firms remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
Only four percent of companies had worked out a strategy to
deal with the change and the same number had made an assessment of
the financial impact the change will have on their business.
</P>
<P>
Given the state of unreadiness of Irish companies, the IBEC
will be embarking on a campaign to improve awareness in the new
year. "The danger is that when companies actually come to look
for outside help it may not be available," the organization's
chief economist, David Croughan, warned.
</P>
<P>
The IBEC questioned 624 companies, employing 184,227 people,
between June and September this year. Overall 91 percent of
companies said Ireland should join, compared with seven percent of
companies who believed Ireland should not join.
</P>
<P>
The financial and wholesale sector was a little more negative,
with 9 percent against joining, while larger companies were a
little more positive with over 96 percent in favor compared with
90 percent of smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
However, fewer businesses believe monetary union will have a
positive effect on their business. Only 57 percent believe it
will be positive, with seven percent believing it will be negative.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector was the most negative, with only 44
percent believing it will be positive, while the manufacturing
sector was the most positive with 59 percent expecting a favorable
impact.

<P>
BEIJING, November 22 (Xinhua) -- The first Sino-foreign joint
machinery leasing company has been set up in Beijing with a
Japanese enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Changcheng Yuasa Machinery Leasing Company was
jointly established by Beijing Guangyu Building Machinery
Equipment Leasing company and Japan's Yuasa Trading Company, at a
cost of 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture will mainly provide machinery leasing
services for the construction, transportation, engineering,
telecommunications and pharmaceutical sectors. It will also offer
maintenance and technology consultancy services.
</P>
<P>
The more than 300-year-old Yuasa Trading Company is a strong
economic force with a long history of business experience. The
Guangyu company is a well-known local firm in Beijing, having
provided leasing services for some of the country's large
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The machinery leasing business is a new industry for China, and
is expected to lower costs in construction by upgrading the
efficiency involved in using machinery.
</P>
<P>
China's housing and building industries have witnessed an
annual growth rate of more than 10 percent in recent years,
indicating that the country has a huge market for machinery
leasing companies.

<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Instead of going to public
libraries or book stands along the street of Beijing, more
residents in the Chinese capital now buy and read books in stores
run by local residents.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has more than 100 such book stores since the first

</P>
<P>
Among them, the Wansheng Book Store is one of the
biggest. Readers visiting the store can freely read books, if they
do not want to buy them.
</P>
<P>
Many such book stores aim to provide convenience for readers,
with services to send books to the homes of customers, or to mail
books, and order unstocked books.
</P>
<P>
Some of the book stores have opened chain stores to compete
with state-owned book stores, and a number often hold culture
lectures, and have tea houses and musical halls to attract readers.
</P>
<P>
People buying books in such stores usually enjoy price
discounts.
</P>
<P>
Famous writer Wu Zuguang said that such book stores have
provided rich "ethical and cultural food" for Beijing residents
who love books.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on Germany to Consider Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today called on the German government to consider
the sentiments of the Iranian people in dealing with the Mykonos
case.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Germany should consider the sentiments of
the Iranian people and those in the Islamic countries," said
Velayati at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the German government made a big mistake in
hearing evidence in the case from former Iranian president
Abolhassan Banisadr.
</P>
<P>
Tehran accused Banisadr, the first president after
the founding of the Islamic Republic, of having colluded with
Baghdad to topple the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in the Bonn-Tehran relations came after the German
federal prosecutor held the Islamic regime, including Iran's
Supreme leader Ali Khamenei, President Hashemi Rafsanjani and some
ministers, accountable for the Mykonos Case.
</P>
<P>
Former leader of Iran's outlawed Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) Sadeq Sharafkandi and three of his companions were killed
by unidentified persons at the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin on
September 17, 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian foreign minister hailed as "very positive
and valuable" a letter from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
President Rafsanjani, which was aimed at ending the political
crisis between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It was a valuable move which showed that the German
government is not interested in destroying ties with Iran," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Kohl assured Tehran in his letter Thursday that his
country did not mean to cause offense to the Iranian people's
religious feelings after German prosecutors accused Iranian
leaders of involvement in the "terrorist" acts in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The allegations provoked widespread and hostile protests in
Tehran. Demonstrators threw tomatoes, eggs and rocks at the
German Embassy, demanding an apology from Bonn for "insulting"
their religious leader.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister expressed his hope that the
"regrettable events" of the past days would not succeed in
"damaging" relations between his country and its top trade
partner Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of
Pakistan today returned the second petition filed by deposed Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto challenging her dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The registrar of the Supreme Court also rejected the objections
made by Bhutto's lawyer to the court's refusal to entertain her
earlier writ.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto filed a petition on November 13 against the dismissal of
her government by President Farooq Leghari earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court returned Bhutto's petition on November 18 on
the grounds that "it contained scandalous, frivolous and
unnecessary" material.
</P>
<P>
Aitzaz Ahsan, Bhutto's lawyer, filed a modified petition on
November 21 along with a letter raising his objections to the
court's refusal to entertain the earlier writ.
</P>
<P>
The registrar said the letter and the modified petition were
contradictory to each other.
</P>
<P>
The letter showed that the petitioner did not accept the advice
of the Supreme Court on using proper language in the petition and
therefore the modified petition was meaningless, he added.
</P>
<P>
The registrar also advised Ahsan to file an appeal directly
before a judge of the apex court, which was believed to be the
last chance for Bhutto to register the case.
</P>
<P>
According to Pakistani laws, the dismissed government must
manage to file a petition in the Supreme Court challenging its
dismissal within one month following its dissolution.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Says Trade Liberalization Depends on Reality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that trade and investment
liberalization of each APEC member should depend on its reality.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing of the first Asian Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) Business Forum, the prime minister said that
the role of business sector in sustaining the region's economic
dynamism is long recognized.
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that business executives from APEC
economies are becoming impatient with the slow rate of progress in
liberalization, harmonization and cooperation, and want political
leaders to share their sense of urgency, he said.
</P>
<P>
But, the prime minister said, business leaders must understand
that political leaders must do "what is best for their respective
economies as a whole."
</P>
<P>
Political leaders do understand that domestic policies need to
be reviewed to facilitate cross-border trade and investment,
Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The business forum and the just-concluded APEC ministerial
meeting are a run-up to the informal APEC leadership Conference
scheduled for Monday in Subic, 80 kilometers north of Manila.
</P>
<P>
APEC members hope that the business forum will spur more
dynamic linkages among the region's business sectors.
</P>
<P>
APEC leaders are expected to meet the business executives
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The APEC Business Forum was sponsored by the APEC Business
Advisory Council, which was created by APEC leaders to provide
insight and counsel on their APEC initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurated in Manila in May 1996, each APEC member selected
three representatives to the council. It replaced the Pacific
Business Forum.

<TEXT>
<P>
In related developments, several officials with the State Grain
Reserve Administration's grain depot in Xuchang city, Heman
province, and officials with Fuyu County's grain bureau in
Heilongjiang province have been arrested for economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhongshui, director of the depot, sold 7.76 billion kg of
corn and 4.02 million kg of wheat from special reserves without
permission from higher authorities, from the end of 1994 to last
April, resulting in three million yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
The grain depot suffered another 200,000 yuan in losses from
rotting wheat caused by improperly maintained storage facilities
and negligence on the part of staff members.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the depot's leaders have also built apartment
buildings and purchased eight luxury cars, all of which violated
state regulations. Liu and six other people have been arrested for
suspected involvement in economic crimes.
</P>
<P>
In Fuyu County, Liu Jianmin, former director of the county
grain bureau, demanded that some grain depots purchase grain
storage equipment from his brother-in-law at a price that was
three to six times the usual price, at a total cost of 2.16
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
County procurators have confirmed that 12 people from the
county's grain departments were involved in the case, taking more
than 200,000 yuan in bribes, with Liu himself accepting 25,500
yuan. Liu and seven other suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement of grain businesses and illegal activities by
some officials are a major factor for business losses, and
authorities have asked grain departments to improve management,
strictly implement rules and regulations, and be on the lookout
for irregular and illegal activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A urban development expert
has suggested that scenic city of Hangzhou in east China's
Zhejiang province should built into an international conference
center.
</P>
<P>
The plan to become an international tourist city over the next
five to 15 years, the expert noted, is compatible with the aim of
becoming a center for international conferences.
</P>
<P>
An article by Leng Xiao in a local newspaper says that
Hangzhou, located at the south of the Yangtze River Delta, one of
the most developed areas in the country, can serve as a support
city to adjacent Shanghai, which is on its way to rising as a
cosmopolitan and an international shipping center in the West
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Experts both at home and abroad regard the 14 cities around the
Delta as the sixth world-class city group in the next century, and
Shanghai, the two provincial capitals of Hangzhou and Nanjing of
Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, will be the centers of the group,
according to the article.
</P>
<P>
With economy in the Delta area becoming increasingly
internationalized, more and more multi nationals are developing
markets in the area, which provide a good opportunity for Hangzhou
to rise as a center for international conferences.
</P>
<P>
Hangzhou, with rivers, lakes, mountains, forests, and springs,
is similar in natural environment to that of Geneva, a city where
many international organizations are headquarted, Leng Xiao noted.
</P>
<P>
And statistics from local tourism authorities show that hotels
accommodating overseas travelers in the city have more than 10,000
rooms, close to Geneva's 12,000 rooms.
</P>
<P>
The article suggests that the local government sets up a
special body to develop strategies for the organization of
international conferences in the city.
</P>
<P>
While upgrading infrastructure, such as building an
international airport and initiating more international routes,
local authorities should focus on the training of managerial staff
and foreign language tuition, it adds.

<P>
BEIJING, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital plans to
raise 500 million yuan over the next five years to build 1.5
million sq.m. of housing for teachers.
</P>
<P>
The increase in spending will mean that per capita living space
for local teachers will go from the current eight sq.m. to ten,
putting it a little bit higher than the local urban average.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the city has given priority to housing
for local teachers, spending 650 million yuan on building 510,000
sq.m. of living space for them.
</P>
<P>
Present per capita living space for teachers in the city is
less than the local urban average, but is 23 percent more than in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The money will be raised through many channels, and the city
will develop preferential policies for teachers in buying housing,
such as five-percent discounts, and other benefits.

<HEADLINE>   Russia Delivers Reactors to Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
Russia has already delivered nuclear reactors to the Islamic
Republic for a power plant in southern port city of Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference: "There are no problems with Russia regarding the
Bushehr nuclear power plant and the project will be completed on
time. Everything is going according to schedule."
</P>
<P>
The first unit of the Bushehr nuclear plant, a joint project
between Iran and Russia, is supposed to be completed by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The first unit will have a designed capacity of 1,000
megawatts. Russia will also provide Iran with nuclear fuel for 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the controversial Bushehr nuclear plant
first got under way in 1974 with the German company Kraftwerk
Union affiliated to Siemens, and at the time of the Islamic
revolution in 1979, 80 percent of the first and 60 percent of the
second unit of the plant were said to have been completed.
</P>
<P>
The German side withdrew from the project after it had been
damaged during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The Russians agreed in January 1995 to complete the re-
construction upon an 1 billion U.S. dollar contract. Some 200
Russian and 500 Iranian experts and technicians are reportedly
co-operating on the power plant.
</P>
<P>
The United States has constantly charged Iran with pursuing
for nuclear weapon program.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran has repeatedly rejected the U.S. accusations,
saying its nuclear activities are solely for peaceful
purposes.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Committee to Fight Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) has established a committee to combat Israel's plans to
expand Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at the weekly PA meeting held in Gaza
Friday night. Palestinian officials said that the committee would
set up offices in the Palestinian towns and villages to coordinate
the fight against Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The committee would provide political, financial and legal
assistance to Palestinian villagers in their struggle against the
land confiscation by Israel for building new settlements.
</P>
<P>
Israel's hardline Likud government, which took over power in
June, lifted in August a freeze on expanding Jewish settlements in
the Palestinian territories on grounds that the natural growth of
settler population in the territories necessitated the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has already approved
several plans to build over 4,000 new housing units in the West
Bank despite of strong opposition from the PA and international
community.
</P>
<P>
One major architect behind the settlement expansion plans is
the hawkish Minister of National Infrastructure Ariel Sharon, who
has persuaded Netanyahu to double financial spending for
settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Settlement expansion has been one of the explosive issues
between Israelis and Palestinians which often leads to violence
and threatens the peace process. The issue is supposed to be
settled in the final status talks, which have been delayed
indefinitely since last May.

According to a new development strategy, the city is scheduled
to enlarge the space of seawater aquiculture, and considerably
diversify its marine products.
</P>

of increasing its fleet of fishing boats with advanced facilities,
and exploiting new fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
He said that the municipal government is encouraging private
and foreign investment in the marine industry, and has been active
in setting up a fishery co-operation foundation to strengthen the

<P>
ANKARA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has blamed Greece for
blocking efforts to start dialogue between Turkey and
Greece over their unsolved disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement late Friday
night that Greece should be held responsible for the failure of
some European Union (EU) members' bid to seek a peaceful solution to
the problems between the two NATO states.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangolos rejected Thursday at
a press conference in Athens a package proposed by Ireland, the EU
term president, for solving the disputes over Cyprus and the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Pangolos reportedly said that Greece would object any effort to
bring Turkey closer to the EU during the EU summit in Dublin in
December.
</P>
<P>
This package is expected to be discussed at the Council of
Foreign Ministers of the EU Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Greek foreign minister also reportedly asked for
international military and economic measures against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece came to the brink of war at the beginning of
this year over the sovereignty of uninhabited islets in the Aegean
known as Ikizce in Turkey, and Imia in Greece.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also are struggling over the continental
shelf of the Aegean sea, and the minority rights of Turks in
western Thrace.

<HEADLINE> 17 People Killed in Somali Factional Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, November 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 17 people were
killed and more than 25 others wounded last night when heavy
shelling started between Somali warlords Hussein Mohamed Aidid
and Osman Hassan Ali Atto in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The shelling, which continued until the early hours of
Saturday, was concentrated on Bulo Waga, Bulo Hubey areas and the
former Russian compound near the ex-21 October parade ground.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness said, the most disastrous episode was that when
four people were killed by a mortar round just behind the milk
factory and a dozen of people had rushed to help them. The
rescuers had no sooner than another mortar round has landed in
the spot, killing seven more and wounding six others.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of families were seen fleeing their houses in Bulo Waga
and the former Russian compound this morning.
</P>
<P>
Another mortar round has landed at the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) headquarters in south Mogadishu,
killing three people and wounding five others.
</P>
<P>
The shelling was taking place at a time when Mogadishu has
been enjoying relative peace for the last four days.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Osman Atto's faction has accused Hussein
Aidid's side for igniting the war, but a top lieutenant
supporting Hussein Aidid said Osman Atto's faction is mercilessly
shelling the residential areas and their government is forced to
defend their people.
</P>
<P>
Even though the intensity of the fighting in which all kinds
of heavy artillery, mortar rounds, anti-aircraft missiles and
heavy machine guns were used, has lessened as the time got close
to noon, sporadic shellings and heavy machine guns were still
being heard in the front line of the warring sides.
</P>
<P>
There are no peace talks among those who are engaged in the
fighting despite the peace talks in Addis Ababa and Nairobi by
some of somalia's factions. Hussein Aidid's faction has boycotted
both meetings in Kenya and Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Disease Hits Nairobi National Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 23 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious disease has been
killing wild animals in the 117-square kilometer National Park in
Nairobi, capital of Kenya, according to a Daily Nation report
today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources from Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) as
saying yesterday that blood samples of the dead game are being
tested locally and in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The sources said, "There are indications that it is
rinderpest, but at the moment we cannot categorically say so."
But they said, it is very mild rinderpest, not an outbreak, so "
there is no cause for alarm."
</P>
<P>
Buffalo, eland and warthog are among the worst hit, said the
sources of the KWS which is responsible for Kenya's game
sanctuaries and the animals.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest mainly attacks ruminants such as the African
buffalo, which live in swamplands and the jungle.
</P>
<P>
The disease has ravaged African buffaloes for many years.
Rinderpest has drastically reduced the number of buffaloes in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Experts worried that unless the authorities move fast, the
disease could easily wipe out the buffalo and eland population in
the Nairobi National Park which attracts some 160,000 visitors
every year.
</P>
<P>
Last year in the Tsavo National Park of Kenya, the disease had
killed 6,000 buffaloes, about 50 percent of the park's buffalo
population.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak was later contained in the park through a joint
vaccination efforts by the KWS, the Department of Veterinary
Services and work by the Pan-African Rinderpest Campaign.

GUIYANG, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou, an economically
less-advantaged province in southwest China, hopes that it can
drive poverty out of the area by upgrading its transportation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The province has invested 627 million yuan in highway projects
since 1985. In the past decade more than 9,400 kilometers of
highways have been built to link up towns and counties, 728
highway bridges erected, and some 3,000 km of highway tunnels dug.
</P>

Now a total of 1,415 towns and townships in the province have
access to roads, making up 92.5 percent of the total, up 8.4
percent from 1985.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 85 percent of the highway investment
has been put into the areas with large numbers of ethnic minority

The diver initially refused the police's efforts to save him,
threatening suicide if he was approached. However, he later
changed his mind and was escorted to a patrol boat after midnight.

<HEADLINE> APEC Ministers Adopt Declaration on Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from the 18 member
economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) approved
here today a declaration on the APEC framework for strengthening
economic cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which came at the end of the Eighth APEC
Ministerial Meeting, set the goals, guiding principles, themes and
priorities for economic and technical cooperation among APEC
members.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the ministers built the essential
elements of economic and technical cooperation contained in the
second part of the Osaka Action Agenda endorsed last year as one
of the three pillars of APEC.
</P>
<P>
Economic and technical cooperation and trade and investment
liberalization and facilitation are mutually complementary and
supportive, they said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the ministers adopted the document which set the
goals of economic and technical cooperation in APEC as "to attain
sustainable growth and equitable development in the Asia Pacific
region, reduce economic disparities among the APEC economies,
improve the economic and social well-being of the people and
deepen the spirit of community in the region."
</P>
<P>
In line with APEC's fundamental principles, the ministers
agreed that the member economies will pursue economic cooperation
and development on the basis of "mutual respect and equality,
mutual benefit and assistance, constructive and genuine
partnership and consensus building." This basis was "consistent
with the consultative, consensual and voluntary approach nurtured
through the development of APEC," they noted.
</P>
<P>
The ministers emphasized in the declaration the need to jointly
undertake economic and technical cooperation activities that would
promote the full participation of all men and women in the
benefits of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In pursuing economic and technical cooperation activities, they
said, APEC members shall also be guided by the responsibility of
achieving economic growth without damaging the environment.
</P>
<P>
The ministers gave priority to joint cooperative activities
that develop human resources; develop stable, safe and efficient
capital markets; strengthen economic infrastructure; harness
technologies for the future; safeguard the quality of life through
environmentally sound growth; and develop and strengthen the
dynamism of small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
They expressed support for new themes that may emerge in the
cooperation process and are consistent with the goals and guiding
principles defined in the framework.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also called for more involvement of the business
and private sectors in APEC economic and technical activities and
the coordination of different APEC working groups or fora in
advancing the goal of economic and technical cooperation in APEC.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that, by giving further coherence and
direction to our economic and technical cooperation, we will
contribute substantially to the goal of a prosperous Asia Pacific
community as we move toward the 21st century," the ministers said
in the declaration.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Decides Not to Provide More Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The (South) Korea National Red
Cross (KNRC) said today that it would not provide food assistance
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) unless
Pyongyang apologizes for the recent submarine incident.
</P>
<P>
"We will not participate in the third round of assistance
efforts by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies (IFRC) to help North Korea (DPRK) unless it
changes its attitude," a KNRC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the KNRC has been requested to actively
take part in the third round of an IFRC assistance program for the
DPRK between December this year and October next year.
</P>
<P>
"We reconfirmed, however, our position that we are unable to
resume aid to North Korea if it does not take steps acceptable to
South Korea on the submarine incident, such as an explicit
acknowledgment of the submarine infiltration, an apology for the
incident and a promise not to repeat it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
So far, the KNRC has provided food and other relief goods worth
a total of 1.8 million U.S. dollars to the DPRK on nine occasions.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has suspended all official economic
exchanges and aid to the DPRK since the submarine incident took
place last September.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has said that a total of 26 armed DPRK people
"infiltrated" into the country's Kangwon province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 DPRK "intruders," one is still at large, while 13
were shot dead by South Korean troops, 11 were found killed by
their colleagues and one was captured alive in a massive manhunt
in the rugged mountains.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK has said that the submarine, while on a training
mission, drifted into South Korean waters after having an engine
trouble and hitting a rock in the sea. Pyongyang has also demand
that Seoul apologize for the incident and hand back the submarine
and its crew.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, however, said that it was not an "inadvertent
incident that occurred during routine training, as Pyongyang said,
but was a 'carefully premediated act of provocation.'"

SEOUL, November 23 (Xinhua) -- The head of one of South Korea's
leading banks has been detained for allegedly taking bribes, said
the South Korean Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office (SPPO) today.
</P>
<P>
Sohn Hong-kyun, head of the Seoul Bank, is accused of taking
some 125,000 U.S. dollars of kickbacks last year from Park Hyun
Soo, head of International Valve Industry Company, said a
prosecution official.
</P>
<P>
In return, Sohn illegally authorized a huge loan by expanding
the ceiling of the company's discounted bill from 11.88 million
dollars to 15.63 million dollars, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The SPPO has acquired a court warrant to confiscate Sohn's bank
books in order to verify the charges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prosecution also booked Park on suspicion of
bribing Sohn.
</P>
<P>
The SPPO has formally sought an arrest warrant for Sohn on
charges of aggravated bribery after he was brought in for
questioning Friday.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Sohn, 60, will be the fourth bank president to be
put behind bars since the inauguration of President Kim Young-sam
in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Earlier arrests included Ahn Young-mo of Donghwa Bank in May
1993, Bong Chong-hyun of Korea Long Term Credit Bank in April 1995
and Rhee Chul-soo of Korea First Bank in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Sohn will also be the 15th top bank official to step down
halfway through his term during the Kim administration.
</P>
<P>
Sohn became Seoul Bank president in February 1994 after his
predecessor stepped down halfway in connection with a big
financial scandal that battered the banking community.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Seoul Bank has been performing poorly with
heavy losses, making it a frequent object of bank mergers that the
Ministry of Finance and Economy has pushed aggressively because of
its poor business performance.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Faces Lack of Funds, Says UN official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 23 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the United
Nations Special Commission on the dismantling of Weapons of Mass
destruction in Iraq (UNSCOM) Rolf Ekeu admitted that his
commission has been facing lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
He told Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) upon his arrival Friday
afternoon that "everything should be paid by Iraq, however until
Iraqi money is available and the Security Council lifts the oil
embargo, we have to depend on member states to fund the mission."
</P>
<P>
He said that Western countries such as the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland as well as the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states provided technical and financial
support while Japan gave limited financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
He described the international funding as temporary until
Iraqi assets are found.
</P>
<P>
"I have warned the Security Council on the unsecure financial
situation we are facing and that we have to bridge the finances
until we can get Iraqi funds, since it is Iraq which has to pay
for our mission," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish diplomat is here on a three-day Gulf tour aimed at
briefing the GCC countries including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain on UNSCOM's work.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM started its work five years ago following the end of
the Gulf War in 1991 during which the U.S.-led allied forces
drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait they occupied for seven
months.
</P>
<P>
He also told KUNA that after five years of work, the UNSCOM
still has not been able to determine the full extent of Iraq's
programs to build and deploy weapons of mass destruction nor the
amount of stocks that remain hidden.
</P>
<P>
He said "what we have not achieved is to have a satisfactory
account of missiles which Iraq may be keeping or an account of
biological and chemical weapon capabilities, so there we are
still concerned and that is the outstanding problem which is not
solved yet."
</P>
<P>
He said "our mission is not only to destroy existing missiles
but to also prevent new missiles from being established."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Kuwait, Ekeus is scheduled to meet with
Amir Salim Al-Sabah, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah and the First Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Jaber Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He will leave Kuwait for Saudi Arabia to continue his Gulf
tour after visiting the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research
and the Kuwait Fund for the Advancement of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He is due in Baghdad, Iraq, on December 8.
