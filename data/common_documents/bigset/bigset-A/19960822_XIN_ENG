<HEADLINE> Wheat Output Falls in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Romania saw a bad harvest in
wheat this year with the output accounting for only 42 percent of
that of last year.
</P>
<P>
But Agriculture and Industry Minister Vasile Tabara said that
wheat supply is enough for domestic consumption this year and that
it is not necessary to import grain.
</P>
<P>
Wheat harvest has been over in Romania. The wheat yield of the
whole country stood at 3.167 million tons, including 1 million
tons of barley and oats. In contrast, the wheat output reached
7.4 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Romania sowed 2.148 hectares of wheat last autumn. The bad
harvest this year was due to freak weather conditions this spring
and disasters caused by wind, hail and a plague of insects in some
areas after June.
</P>
<P>
A total of 850,000 hectares of wheat-growing areas were hit by
disasters, of which over 500,000 hectares seriously.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government is working hard to improve the
purchase of wheat from farmers and set the purchasing price of
wheat at 500 leu per kilogram.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Divorce Rate Up 15.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's divorce cases stood at
8,993 in the past three months this year, an increase of 15.6
percent compared with the corresponding period last year, today's
local Persian daily Akhbara reported.
</P>
<P>
High inflation and less income are believed to be the main
causes for the increasing number of divorces, specialists here
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They said that economic pressure would cause disharmony
in many Iranian families. Husbands and wives would have more
quarrels due to their limited financial source.
</P>
<P>
On average, a government employee earns about 100 U.S. dollars
a month. About half of government employees are living below
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Ayatollah Morteza Moqtada'ie declared last
year that the courts would grant divorce to women in Iran where
the men usually have the final say on the divorce.
</P>
<P>
He said that if it is proven that the hardships are
insurmountable for the woman then the courts will grant her the
divorce regardless of her husband's consent.
</P>
<P>
An expert on family law said that the "definition of hardship
could be really general and could include psychological torment
suffered by women at the hands of their husbands."
</P>
<P>
"The Islamic society and Islam do not encourage divorce. But
divorce is allowed if all efforts to salvage the marriage fails,"
he added.

<P>
LUANDA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The plenary session of the
former rebel UNITA special deputies, opened in central Angolan
city Bailundo yesterday afternoon, continues today, according
to Angola's official news agency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is centered on national reconciliation, Angolans
and their rights, economic and social orders and how to make the
UNITA play a leading role in Angola's political life.
</P>
<P>
New measures taken by the UNITA (national union for the
total independence of Angola) in solving the outstanding
military and political problems in the Angolan peace process will
also be discussed in the session which will end next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said, however, that the most important topic at
the meeting is whether President of the UNITA Jonas Savimbi
should serve as vice president in the new government or not.
</P>
<P>
They said that the outcome of the problem will have direct
influence on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Strong Performance for Malaysia's Services Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's services sector
recorded strong performance in 1995 with a double-digit expansion,
although at a slower rate of 11.5 percent compared with 17.2
percent in 1994, according to an official survey released here
today.
</P>
<P>
Average capital investment of the services companies surveyed
expanded at an average rate of 17.6 percent in 1994 and 1995 while
in terms of value, it rose from 29.4 million ringgit (11.76
million U.S. dollars) in 1993 to 40.7 million ringgit (16.28
million dollars) in 1995, shows the survey which covered 358
companies of selected services.
</P>
<P>
However, the average level of pre-tax profits dropped by 11.6
percent to 17 million ringgit (6.8 million dollars) in 1995 as
against a 47.2 percent increase to 19 million ringgit (7.6 million
dollars) in 1994, due to lower returns in the transport, storage
and communications sub-sector, the survey, conducted by the
Malaysian National Bank, said.
</P>
<P>
The surveyed companies, it said, faced pressing problems such
as labour constraints, inaccess to domestic and export markets,
shortage and irregular supply of goods.
</P>
<P>
The distributive trade, hotels and restaurants, transport,
storage and communications and business and professional services
also cited shortages of skills, inaccessebility to credit
facilities and government red tape as major problems.
</P>
<P>
The national bank said the services sector was expected to play
an increasingly important role in the growth process, especially
in view of the deficit in the services account of the balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
It said it was essential for the domestic services sector to
continue to expand and enhance its sophistication in order to
provide a wider range of service activities which could accomodate
itself to the shift to a more sophisticated industrial structure.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Strike Organizers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two of the organizers of the
civil servants' strike were today arrested by the Zimbabwe police
on suspicions of forcing government employees to participate in
the industrial action.
</P>
<P>
Public Service Association (PSA) Executive Secretary John
Makoni and his assistant Charles Chiviru were arrested while
mobilizing civil servants at a government composite office block
in Harare, Zimbabwean republic Police spokesman Dave Njagu said.
</P>
<P>
"The two men were picked for forcing people to join the strike
and the police are now looking into the charges," said Njagu.
</P>
<P>
The strike to press the government to review upward an average
nine percent salary increment announced last month entered its
third day in defiance of a government ruling that it is illegal
and the workers will be fired.
</P>
<P>
However, a statement released earlier by the police said
people found threatening any civil servants and forcing them to
participate in the strike will be arrested and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"Police have received numerous calls from some persons
complaining of being harassed and physically handled by some
organizers of the on-going civil servants strike," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The health workers strike started on Monday and was later
joined by the rest of the civil servants who are demanding a pay
rise of 60 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants to Ease Tension with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel has reportedly asked
the United States to help defuse the tension between Israel and
Syria, which has been escalated since Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu took office in June.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, U.S. Ambassador Martin
Indyk met today with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy to
discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Indyk also held talks on the situation between Israel and
Syria and Lebanon today with Eitan Bentsur, acting director-
general of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Indyk was told that Israel was interested in calming the
situation, in moving the peace process forward, and in peace with
Syria and peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador was reportedly asked to convey this message
to the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Syrian newspapers today accused the Israeli
government of launching "a crazy campaign" against Syria.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Al-Ba'ath said that Netanyahu was
escalating campaigns against Syria, so as to force it to drop its
demand for a fully Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Referring to reports that Syria has recently tested a
long-range Scud missile capable of hitting targets in most
Israel, the newspaper said Syria's arm purchases were only for
defense purposes.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu told the Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee of the Knesset (parliament) Wednesday that
he was still waiting for Syria's response to his proposal that the
peace negotiations be resumed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier noted that his "Lebanon First" proposal
was necessitated by the escalation of tensions in Lebanon in
recent years. "However, Syria is apparently not interested," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under Netanyahu's "Lebanon First" idea, the Israeli army would
withdraw from its self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
for a promise of quiet on the Israeli northern border from the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon rejected the proposal, and Lebanese
President Elias Hrawi stressed that his country could not agree to
such an approach, since this would leave Syria exposed.

BRUSSELS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
expressed concern over the D'Amato Bill enacted by the United
States against Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a statement that it has repeatedly voiced its
opposition to the bill and that the sanctions were not appropriate
or effective means to combat international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the U.S. government be aware of the negative
effects of the new bill, especially the possibility of damaging
the international trading system.
</P>
<P>
The EU urged Washington to work with its partners in protecting
and promoting an open international trading environment.
</P>
<P>
"The EU reaffirmed its determination to act in appropriate
international forums, including the World Trade Organization, in
defense of its rights and interests and to show solidarity in
safeguarding company interests of EU members if they are affected
by the legislation," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the EU shared the concerns with the United States
about the threat of international terrorism and it would continue
active participation in international efforts to address the
threat.
</P>
<P>
"We also expect to see an improvement in Iran and Libya's
cooperation with the international community," the EU said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Institution Urges Ban on Use of Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. institution has called
for a total ban on the use of landmines in the world because they
are the real threats to human life.
</P>
<P>
In the latest issue of The Defense Monitor, the Center for
Defense Information (CDI) said that there are currently over 100
million landmines scattering in 62 countries, or approximately one
mine for every 50 people on earth.
</P>
<P>
It added that there are estimatedly an additional 100 million
mines in stockpiles around the world.
</P>
<P>
The landmine problems are more serious in Afghanistan, Angola
and Cambodia, which are besieged by an estimated 28 million mines
and suffer 22,000 casualties every year, or 85 percent of the
world total.
</P>
<P>
Landmines are the real weapons of mass destruction because they
have killed or maimed more people than nuclear, biological, and
chemical weapons combined did.
</P>
<P>
While urging the world community to continue its efforts
against the use of landmines, the CDI also criticized the
U.S. government for promoting the use of short-lived landmines.
</P>
<P>
"Short- or long-lived, all landmines are indiscriminate and
especially injurious weapons of terror," it said. "Present
policies and actions of the U.S. government fail the humanitarian
cause of protecting civilians from the scourge of landmines."

BERLIN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of bankrupt businesses
in Europe has been on the rise since 1994 and ill-fated businesses
may increase 6 percent to 200,000 in 1996, an insurance company in
Germany's Hamburg reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the figures released recently by the Hamburg
Hermes Credit and Insurance Company, three quarters of the 200,000
bankrupt businesses are in Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
France led other countries on the list with 58,614 firms
declared bankrupt in 1994 and 59,503 in 1995, and the figure may
reach 64,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain came in the second place, announcing 43,625
bankruptcies in 1994, 41,303 in 1995 and probably 43,500 this year.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Germany, Italy and Sweden, though
registering a much lower rate of bankruptcy than France and
Britain, witnessed a similar rising trend of bankrupt businesses
in their respective countries.

<HEADLINE> UK Takes Tough Line on Open Skies Deal with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government has said
that it is not prepared to sign an "open skies" agreement with the
United States similar to the U.S.-German aviation accord, the
Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The British and U.S. government representatives are due to
resume their open skies talks on August 28-29 in Washington and
both sides are anxious to strike a deal before the U.S.
presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government has made it clear that the
United States would have to make concrete concessions so that a
new aviation agreement can be reached, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One British government official is quoted as saying, "they are
as obdurate as ever. They want everything and they want to give
nothing. With the American elections coming up, the schedule is
rather tight."
</P>
<P>
Washington has demanded an open skies agreement with Britain
before it will give green light to the proposed alliance between
British Airways and the American Airline, which is expected to
create the world's most powerful aviation partnership.
</P>
<P>
Both sides mainly differ over the meaning of open skies: the
Americans view it as the right of any of its carriers to fly to
any point in Britain, including Heathrow airport and onwards to
third countries. The German-U.S. agreement, reached earlier this
year, embodied this principle.
</P>
<P>
But the British side rejected such a deal by saying "we do not
accept the American version of open skies is the only one or the
correct one."
</P>
<P>
British officials said that Britain would not grant "beyond
rights" for passenger flights, which allow U.S. carriers to fly
within the European Union aviation market, while foreign airlines
do not have the right to fly between two points in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
The talks to be held in Washington next week would be limited
to incidental matters on agreeing a disputes procedure and the
next round of talks on substantive issues such as access to
Heathrow airport and American demand for beyond rights are
expected to be held in London in September.

<HEADLINE> Somali Factional Leader Warns Against Possible Attack on Kismayo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Major General Adan Nur
Gabyow, the nominal Chairman of the Somali Patriotic Front (SPM)
of Kismayo, today criticized warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid for
planning a massive attack on the southern port town of Kismayo.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference in north Mogadishu today, Gabyow said
dozens of heavily armed wagons belonging to Hussein Aidid's
faction are heading towards Kismayo and towards the whole region
of Lower Jubba. gabyow, also former Defense Minister of the late
regime, has warned the supporters of Mohamed Siad Hirsi Morgan,
the SPM's Deputy Chairman, against the attack and called on them
to be ready in their defensive positions.
</P>
<P>
According to General Gabyow, the main objective of the attack
is to conquer the international seaport of Kismayo so as to
restart the exportation of the banana which ceased after Osman
Atto and Ali Mahdi had jointly closed down Mogadishu's main
seaport in October last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the banana exporting companes are planning to capture
Kismayo before September 1.
</P>
<P>
Gabyow accused the American Company of Dole and Italian firms
for supporting the illegal export of the banana.
</P>
<P>
Jubba Valley, which is one of the richest regions of the
country in agricutrue, livestock and fishing industries, has
been a battle field for the pastoral subclans of Somalia since
the downfall of the late Siad Barre regime.
</P>
<P>
But the government of Hussein Mohamed Aidid has denied the
existence of such a plan. A spokesman of the government has
characterized Gabyow's statement as "a purely fabricated lie".

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has said it still believes
that dialogue is the only way to resolve its dispute with
Cameroon over the Bakassi Peninsula despite alleged military
build-up by Cameroon in that area.
</P>
<P>
But the recourse to dialogue does not mean that Nigeria will
not retaliate if it is attacked by Cameroon, Director of Defense
Information Fred Chijuka said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not go to sleep. We will always fight back in
self-defense. But we will never attack Cameroon first," Chijuka
said, adding that "we believe they are our neighbor."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the Defense Headquarters has urged Nigerians
not to enlist in the Cameroonian army to fight their country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, General Officer commanding 82nd division of
Nigerian army Felix Mujakperuo warned Nigerians against joining
the Cameroon army for a salary of 11,000 Naira (nearly 130 US
Dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 1,000 Nigerians from the border
states of Cross River and Akwa Ibom have been recruited by the
Cameroonian armed forces.

<HEADLINE> EU Threatens to Appeal to WTO over U.S. Sanctions Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has said
that it would appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) if the
United States punished European firms with business links with
Iran and Libya, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called D'Amato legislation, signed by U.S.
President Bill Clinton earlier this month, the American government
will penalize those foreign companies or individuals that invest
above 40 million U.S. dollars a year in the energy sectors of Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government on behalf of the EU said in a statement,
"the EU does not believe that this legislation is an appropriate
or an effective means of combating international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Ireland, which is the current EU presidency state, made it
clear that the D'Amato legislation could damage the system of
world trade and the U.S. should work with its partners to promote
an open international trading environment.
</P>
<P>
"The Union reaffirms its determination to act in the
appropriate international forum, including the World Trade
Organization, in defense of the interests of member state
companies if these are affected by the legislation," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has
earlier lodged a formal protest with the U.S. government on the
issue and EU diplomats have also met with U.S. government
officials to complain about the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has also warned that 20 percent of EU
oil imports came from the two countries and the U.S. sanctions law
could affect EU oil supplies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn
of Thailand toured Beijing Language and Culture University today.
</P>
<P>
The princess exchanged books with president of the University
and toured some of the computerized facilities on the campus. She
also found a book she wrote on her previous China trip in the
University library.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Language and Culture University focuses on teaching
and researching Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Princess Sirindhorn, who speaks good Chinese, has an interest
in Chinese culture and history. Whenever she visits China she
tours culture institutions and writes her own travel notes.
</P>
<P>
Though this is her 7th visit to China, the country - in her
own words the "hometown of the dragon" - attracts her just as
much as it did on her first visit.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Thai embassy in Beijing said the princess
"enjoys everything here" -- China's culture, landscapes, even
Maotai, the well-known alcoholic beverage.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Beijing earlier today, the princess visited
Sichuan and Hubei provinces, and studied the preservation of
cultural relics near the Three Gorges area.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- France today hailed the agreement
in principle reached by Romania and Hungary on August 14 on the
forthcoming signing of a political treaty which will guarantee the
protection of ethnic minorities in both countries.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said that
the last barrier to the signing of the treaty has been lifted, and
that France hopes that the treaty will be signed as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Romania and Hungary have agreed upon a common interpretation of
the 1201 Recommendation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe on the status of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"Such a development can only help the adherence of the two
countries to the European Union, a perspective which we fully
support," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
have laid out the signing of such a political treaty as a
precondition for the admission of Romania and Hungary into the two
Western groups.
</P>
<P>
As inheritances from the former Austrian-Hungarian Empire,
Romania has an ethnic Hungarian minority population, while Hungary
has an ethnic Romanian minority population.

<HEADLINE> UK Companies Authorized to Trade in Iraqi Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- UK petroleum and petroleum
product traders can now trade with their Iraqi counterparts,
following agreement between the United Nations and Iraq on the
implementation of UNSCR 986, according to an official press notice
released here today.
</P>
<P>
UNSCR 986 is a free-standing humanitarian measure and should
not be interpreted as a relaxation of sanctions against Iraq, the
press notice said.
</P>
<P>
The British Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has now
issued two licenses concerning Iraq. The first, an Open General
Oil Trade License, authorizes companies to make contracts to
export from Iraq petroleum and petroleum products that have been
approved by the UN in accordance with UNSCR 986.
</P>
<P>
The second license, an Open General Oil Processing and
Transport License, authorizes companies to process and transport
approved exported Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
These new licenses follow the issue of an Open General License
to Communicate by the DTI on 21 May. This authorized
pre-contractual discussions by UK petroleum and petroleum product
traders with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
There is no change to the UK's existing licensing regime for
exports to Iraq, The press notice said. Under this, companies are
required to apply for individual licenses to communicate about the
supply of goods generally, and also to apply for individual export
licenses which must be approved by the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Provocative Threats do not Serve Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri stressed here today that the "provocative" threats by
Israel would not serve the cause of peace, nor would force Syria
and Lebanon to change their united positions, the Lebanese
National News Agency (LNNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks upon departure for Damascus this
morning on a brief visit to Syria. He returned home this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister underlined, "The Israeli intransigent and
provocative threats, aggressions, suggestions and positions do not
serve the cause of peace and do not affect the united
Syrian-Lebanese stand and their determination to adhere to (the
principle on) the land, right and dignity."
</P>
<P>
The state-run LNNA said that during his visit Hariri "held
consultations with Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and
a number of other senior officials."
</P>
<P>
It added that the talks dealt with the latest developments on
both bilateral and regional arenas, and results of the recent
contacts pertaining to the situations in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese premier indicated, "It is natural to intensify the
 consultations with the Syrian brothers especially when Israel is
attempting to thwart the current efforts aimed at bringing the
peace process out of its dilemma which had been created by the
new Israeli government's policy."
</P>
<P>
Hariri was quoted by the LNNA as saying that "Syria and
Lebanon are working together within the framework of the Cairo
summit resolutions to consolidate the Arab rank...and proceeding
from that the just and comprehensive peace is the strategic Arab
goal."
</P>
<P>
Hariri's remarks came as an apparent reaction to a threat made
by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday when he
visited the Israeli-occupied "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, during his first visit to the "security zone" since
he took office in June, warned that the guerrilla raids on the
Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
would not pass without counterattacks by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"We will not bear a situation in which we and our allies are
subject to blows from the other side and stand still," the
Israeli premier said.
</P>
<P>
"Recurring attacks on our soldiers and our allies in this
region is a flawed method that will cause the escalation of the
situation," Netanyahu added.

LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain fell 0.6
percent in volume terms last month after a June rise of 1.4ts for July were 0
 percent and 3.2 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the three months to July, however, the year-on-year rate of
increase held steady at the 2.7 percent recorded in June, itself
an 18-months high.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is enjoying a slow but steady economic
growth with low inflation, immediately welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the weaker-than-expected retail sales data
raised the possibility of yet another interest rates cut in the
run up to the general election, due to be held by next May, since
the ruling Conservatives are still lagging behind the opposition
Labour by over 20 points in opinion polls.

Speaking at a news conference upon his arrival in Chechen
capital of Grozny, Lebed said "the problem of the ultimatum"
issued by Konstantin Pulikovsky, acting commander of Russian
troops in Chechnya, "will be resolved by morning."
</P>
<P>
"We will no longer use the language of ultimatums," pointed out
Lebed, secretary of the Russian Security Council and special envoy
of President Boris Yeltsin to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the news conference, he left for a meeting with

peace".
</P>
<P>
Immediately upon his arrival, Lebed met Vyacheslav Tikhomirov,
commander of Russian troops in Chechnya, and his deputy
Pulikovsky. Tikhomirov, back from vocation, returned to Khankala
on Tuesday, taking the command of allied operation in Chechnya

<HEADLINE> ICRC Calls on Russia to Extend Ultimatum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Wednesday strongly urged
Russia to extend the deadline imposed on Grozny's civilian
population instructing them to leave the city by August 22 when
fighting may intensify.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said it is extremely concerned about the tragic turn
of events in Grozny and the plight of civilians who will remain
trapped as the 48-hour deadline is too short to allow them to
leave.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC further called on the conflicting parties to create
humanitarian corridors so that civilians can be evacuated rapidly
and their safety guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that after the flight of almost 60,000 inhabitants
between August 14 and 18, another 70,000 left Grozny on August 20.
On August 21 about 120,000 people still remained there.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC appealed to the parties in conflict to abide by the
rules of international humanitarian law and in particular to spare
the civilian population, which must be protected from the dangers
arising from military operations.
</P>
<P>
It also reminded the conflicting parties of their obligation to
respect medical personnel and medical facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- French Interior Minister
Jean-Louis Debre has asked the Council of State, an independent
watchdog organ for evaluating legality of government ordinances,
to evaluate the present immigration policy which has been in force
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a communique issued by the French Prime
Minister's Office after a cabinet meeting held today on the crisis
of the paperless immigrants who have been occupying Saint-Bernard
Church in Paris for 52 days.
</P>
<P>
"The movement engaged in the Saint-Bernard cannot in any case
lead to the jeopardizing of of the application of the laws which
make up the legal framework of the immigration policy chosen by
our country and voted by the parliament," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Debre is due to have a meeting with the
spokesman of the 300 African paperless immigrants, Boubakar Diop,
Agence France Presse quoted well-informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The French Prime Minister's Office said that "the solution to
the situation of foreigners present at the Saint-Bernard Church
becomes the object, in the framework of law, of an examination on
some individuals (among them) while taking into account the
particular humanitarian situation and especially the situation
of the families concerned."
</P>
<P>
It stressed that "clandestine immigration should be fought
with the greatest firmness" and mass granting of residential
papers to clandestine foreigners will trigger in the following
weeks or months "a new influx of irregular foreigners."
</P>
<P>
Local media said that the ruling rightwing parties are on the
verge of a nerve breakdown facing the intransigent stand of the
paperless in Saint-Bernard Church, ten of whom have been staging a
hunger strike for 47 days.
</P>
<P>
President Jacuqes Chirac and the government are also under
immense pressure from the French leftwing forces and trade unions,
who are urging a solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Greek Ruling Party Seek Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis is expected on Friday to announce his intend to call early
elections as senior ruling party officials indicated that the only
remaining decision to be taken concerned when the ballot would be
held.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas declared today the cabinet
will meet on Thursday evening to take a decision on the holding of
early general elections.
</P>
<P>
"If the cabinet decides in favor of early elections, Prime
Minister Costas Simitis will visit President Kostis Stephanopoulos
before announcing the election date", the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
If called, the early elections must be held within 30 days,
pinpointing September 29 or October 6 as the likeliest dates.
</P>
<P>
The current Socialists' four-year term ends in October 1997 but
Simitis has reportedly been under pressure from senior cabinet
ministers, especially economy officials, to take advantage of his
high popularity rankings and call early elections.
</P>
<P>
Those who support the early elections said a renewed mandate
through early elections would give him a free hand to implement
sweeping reforms in the ailing economy and the public sector and
to find ways to deal with neighboring Turkey on differences over
territorial rights in the Aegean sea and the divided island of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Alekos Papadopoulos and Economy Minister
Yiannos Papantoniou as well as Development Minister Vasso
Papandreou, all are key members of the cabinet, want a free hand
in implementing deep spending cuts in next year's budget which
will be critical for meeting European Union economic convergence
targets.
</P>
<P>
With Simitis enjoying high approval ratings in public opinion
polls, many senior Socialists believe this may be an opportune
time for a re-election bid. But some backbench Socialist MPs
believe the Socialists will lose credibility unless they exhaust
the four-year term to which they were elected in October 1993.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Mobilizing women is a key
to curb the food problem in Africa, the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) chief said here today.
</P>
<P>
FAO Director General Jacques Diouf told a press conference at
the end of his three-day tour of the country that 60 percent of
agricultural production is being produced by women in Africa.
</P>
<P>
To mobilize African women in food production, FAO is trying
to provide training, credit facilities and other resources.
</P>
<P>
Africa has a basic problem on water control, land degradation,
deforestation and overuse of water resources, according to the
FAO chief.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government and the private sector to suggest
plans of action on the problem of food production which will be
tabled at the world food summit, scheduled to open in Rome next
November.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Diouf arrived here last Sunday. He has held talks on the

<HEADLINE> UN Urged to Set Deadline for Angola Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo Dos
Santos today urged the United Nations to set a deadline to speed
up the delayed peace process of the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U. N. Security Council, Santos suggested
that August 25 be the deadline for integrating soldiers of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) into
the new National Army.
</P>
<P>
The consultation among the political parties on a new
constitution should also be completed by that date, according to
the president.
</P>
<P>
By September 5, free movement of goods and persons should be
achieved, said Santos in the letter, adding that the former
warring sides should begin to form a new government of national
unity on the same date.
</P>
<P>
The president called for the U. N. to make a detailed "peace
timetable" for Angola and send a special observers mission to the
country to monitor the implementation of the timetable.
</P>
<P>
Angola's peace process was delayed as the UNITA's 63,000
fighters failed to be totally disarmed and camped as scheduled by
August 15.

<HEADLINE> French Government Softens Stand on Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
softened its stand on illegal immigration by beginning dialogue
with the paperless Africans who have been occupying the
Saint-Bernard Church in Paris for nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre today received
Bubakar Diop, the spokesman of the 300 African paperless in his
ministry, after joining a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Alain Juppe and attended by eight other ministers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Debre has asked the supreme administrative
jurisdiction, the Council of State, to evaluate the application of
the immigration policy made by former interior minister Charles
Pasqua in 1993. The latter is expected to give its opinion before
the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Debre accused some left-wing parties of adopting "a strategic
policy to make disappear the law of the Republic" on immigration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the French government has never and will never
expel the sick and the pregnant among the illegal immigrants.
"This is not the tradition of France," he said.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the French Prime Minister's Office said
that "the movement going on in the Saint Bernard Church cannot in
any case lead to the jeopardizing of the application of the laws
which make up the legal framework of the immigration policy chosen
by the country and voted by the parliament."
</P>
<P>
While stressing that illegal immigration should be fought
"with the greatest firmness," the government communique said that
the government will regularize the status of some individuals in
accordance with humanitarian situation and the situation of their
families.
</P>
<P>
Five thousand people, called by the Socialist Party and the
Communist Party, went to the street in Paris this evening to show
solidarity with the paperless in Saint Bernard Church.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest poll by the CSA polling institute and
published by the "Parisien" daily, 18 percent of Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen support the paperless and 32 percent are sympathetic
with them, while 30 percent are "opposed enough" and 21 percent
are "frankly hostile" to the illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande said that the
government "has been well obliged to make concession which is
imposing itself."
</P>
<P>
The Union for the Democracy of France leader Francois Leotard
said that he is satisfied with the communique issued by the
government "with precisions given by the Prime Minister... on the
immigration policy conducted by the government."
</P>
<P>
The ultra-rightist Front National accused the government of
"preparing to capitulate."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Premier: Turco-Iranian Pipeline Ready in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan said here today that under the natural gas deal signed by
Turkey and Iran, the gas pipeline would be completed within one
year.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the announcement in a press conference after
returning home earlier today from his 11-day first foreign visit
to Iran, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said: "Turkey needs natural gas badly. The
natural gas from Russia is inadequate from what Turkey actually
needs. It is important from the point of view of the development
of Turkey's eastern and southeastern regions."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan asserted, "We have entered a race with (Iranian
President Hashemi) Rafsanjani on this issue. Natural gas projects
are being studied by our relevant ministry."
</P>
<P>
He added, "We want this gas to pass through Van (eastern
Turkey) from the point of economics. If the line via Van is
deemed appropriate from the viewpoint of economics, we will
complete the construction of the pipeline connecting Van to the
border within one year."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan pointed out, "As to the United States, the
U.S. administration regards this with understanding. However, some
in the U.S. make negative comments on the gas deal."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. reaction on the deal, he said, "Turkey
is an independent country. We are entrusted with the solution of
our national issues. Here we are not only exercising one of our
rights, but we are also performing our duty. Doing this is as
natural as natural gas."
</P>
<P>
The premier claimed that Turkey had signed an anti-terrorism
agreement with Iran and would cooperate with countries of the
region to eradicate terrorism which he described as a crime
against humanity in the whole of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan paid an official visit to Iran between August 10 and
12 despite the threat by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the D'Amato-Kennedy bill on
August 5 to reinforce an embargo against Iran and Libya by
dissuading foreign companies and individuals from investing
heavily in the oil industries of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Prospects for Economic Growth Bright, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's prospects for economic
growth this year are bright. The gross domestic product is
forecast to grow between 5.0 and 5.4 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by the Minister of Finance and Economic
Development, R. Penza when he officiated an international
conference on "Economic Liberalization: Expenses and the Way
Forward" here today.
</P>
<P>
Penza noted that such prospects will be made possible by the
government's resolve to continue tight monetary and fiscal
policies to secure good agricultural harvest, improvement of
production in copper and cobalt, increased performance in the
non-traditional sector and the new surge of investment by
privatisation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said: "To ensure that the reform program realizes
its maximum benefits to the economy, and that these benefits are
long lasting, the government will not relent on its commitment.
The government will not only continue to provide an enabling
environment for private investment but will also help in the
provision of public goods to augment efforts of the private
sector."
</P>
<P>
As new hope and confidence are on the horizon, Penza said, "my
appeal to the private sector is that please do not just
articulate, come aboard."

<HEADLINE> SADC Warns Member States Against Selfishness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today warned its member states
against selfishness and urged them to make compromises for
regional integration.
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to the SADC Council of Ministers
meeting, which began in Lesotho's capital of Maseru today, SADC
Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende said progress towards regional
integration had sometimes been curtailed by self-centered
negotiations among member states.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said: "Some experts have negotiated more from their
short-term national interests rather than from their country's
long-term interest in regional integration."
</P>
<P>
Mbuende's remarks came at a time when South African delegates
were reluctant about the draft trade protocol scheduled to be
signed at the SADC's summit in Maseru on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The trade protocol, which was finalized by SADC ministers at
their meeting in Dar es Salaam on August 8, was aimed to
establish a free trade area in the region within eight years.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Mbuende said negotiations for regional
integration would be tough "given the sensitive nature of the
issues involved."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, member states should recognize the need to
take a regional dimension in their programs and negotiations, and
be prepared to make trade-offs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.

LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- All the 30 new state
administrators who were sworn in today are urged to abide by
government policies and serve the interest of the Nigerian people.
</P>
<P>
At the swearing-in ceremony held in Abuja, capital of Nigeria,
head of state General Sani Abacha said that the federal
government has mapped out a code of conduct and operational
guidelines to enhance the monitoring of the performance of the
newly appointed military administrators.
</P>
<P>
The new administrators are required to follow the government
policy which forbids any state from taking foreign loans of any
nature for its development purposes.
</P>
<P>
Rather, they should make full use of revenue generated from
internal sources for the development objectives, Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
The officers, who are in the ranks of lieutenant colonel and
colonel or equivalents, include 20 from the army.
</P>
<P>
The major reshuffle of state administrators has caused
mixed reaction across the country but sources said that the
generality of the people believe the exercise is merely a choice
between six of one and half a dozen of the other.

<HEADLINE> De Klerk Apologizes for Apartheid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President F. W. de Klerk today apologized for the apartheid
policies carried out by the former government he led, but denied
that it had ever backed murder or torture of political opponents.
</P>
<P>
"I should like to express my deepest sympathy with all those
on all sides who suffered during the conflict," said de Klerk who
is at present the leader of the opposition National Party (NP).
</P>
<P>
In the NP's 34-page submission to a special Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearing in Cape Town, de Klerk
said the NP was prepared to take the responsibility for the "many
mistakes of the past" and for "the immeasurable pain and
suffering" caused by the his party's former apartheid policies.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader also accepted on behalf of the NP the
overall responsibility for apartheid-era human rights abuses
committed when he was president of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the former president stressed that he had never been
party to any decision by the cabinet, the state security council
or any other committee authorizing the execution of gross
violation of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"Nor did I individually or indirectly ever suggest, order or
authorize any such action," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although he admitted the former cabinet had used
"unconventional strategies" such as information gathering,
disinformation and assistance to organizations opposed to the
liberation movements, de Klerk argued that none of these
strategies included the authorization of assassination, murder,
torture, rape and assault.
</P>
<P>
TRC Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine praised de Klerk for his
courage to admit the mistakes, saying "I don't think anyone
should underestimate the power of a public leader, a former state
president, saying sorry."
</P>
<P>
The special TRC hearings, chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
was held since Monday for political parties to present their
truth findings.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front and the African Christian Democratic Party
had presented their truth submissions on Monday while the Pan
Africanist Congress and the Democratic Party had presented their
submissions on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The White House today tried
to dispel growing doubts in U.S. press reports about health of
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, and expressed the belief that
Yeltsin remains in control of his government.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the press reports at a news briefing here, White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said that there is no reason to doubt
Russian government assertions that Yeltsin is now taking an
extended post-election vacation outside the Russian capital but he

<P>
"Our assessment is based on the information that we have
available that has been communicated publicly by the Russian
Federation," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Yeltsin "has indicated a desire to take
some vacation time after a strenuous campaign period" in the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
"That dosen't seem to be too unusual," McCurry said. "One might
hope that the American president would do likewise."
</P>

Latest local press reports said that Yeltsin, reportedly
suffering from a heart problem, is on his way back to Moscow after
a vacation retreat.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Recent tests show bacteria
levels in Washington D.C. tap water remain high, making August the
third month that federal drinking water safety standards have been
violated, The Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Although this month's testing isn't complete, the city is sure
to violate federal standards because so many samples have tested
positive already, the newspaper quoted Environment Protection
Agency (EPA) officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The District's chronic bacteria problems reflect years of
neglected city pipe maintenance and replacement, EPA officials
said, adding that the problem will take years to fix and residents
should prepare for possible future drinking-water law violation.
</P>
<P>
The city's two water treatment plants only got partial success
by adding extra chlorine last month to kill the bacteria, the
newspaper said, and experiments are under way with a stronger
disinfection chemical, chloramines, but full use is a year or two
away.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted a U.S. Geological Survey report as
saying that June 20 testing of Potomac River water found 4.1 parts
per billion of a harmful herbicide, while federal law allows no
more than 3 parts per billion in treated drinking water.

LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
reversed their recent gains and closed sharply lower today as
hopes of a long-awaited interest rates cut in Germany was dampened
by an influential business survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey of business conditions in Germany climbed to an
eight-month high of 94.1 points last month, showing a sudden surge
of confidence in the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Shares prices in Frankfurt fell on the news as dealers thought
that the Bundesbank would be under no pressure to cut its rates to
boost the economy.
</P>
<P>
The London stock market extended its Tuesday's surge and hit a
new intraday peak of 3,894.4 earlier today on today's July retail
trade figures which suffered a surprise 0.6 percent drop. The weak
data raised the possibility of yet another interest rates cut.
</P>
<P>
But London's Financial Times-Stock Market Exchange index of 100
leading British shares closed 11.1 points lower after a fall on
Wall Street and profit-taking dealings.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse finished sharply lower, subdued by a weak
franc, evaporating hopes of a German rate cut and the lower start
on Wall Street although it managed to maintain the 2,000 level.
</P>

London's FTSE 100 index closed down 11.1 points at 3,872.1.
Paris's CAC-40 index finished down 18.62 at 2,000.64. Frankfurt's

with the best interests of the citizens of northern Iraq."
</P>
<P>
When asked who are those outside parties, Davies referred
specifically to Iran, which Washington regards as one of its arch
enemies and has tried whatever it could to strangle Iran's economy
for fear that Iran would threaten its presence in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has recently signed into law a bill in
an attempt to stop U.S. allies' firms investing in Iran's energy
sector.
</P>
<P>
"We simply want to make clear to Iran that they cannot play a
useful role in northern Iraq," Davies said.
</P>
<P>
Davies called on the leaders of the two Kurdish parties -- the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party --
in northern Iraq to exercise restraint to prevent the conflict
from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq is an enclave, created after the Gulf War in 1991
by the United States and its Western allies to prevent Saddam
Hussein's troops from entering that area, where Kurds live.
</P>
<P>
Davies also said that the United States has called on the two
parties to resume talks in London under the U.S. auspices to
discuss their differences. But the United States has yet to await
a response from the two warring Kurdish parties.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Nations Urged to Reduce Child Mortality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A South Asian
conference on children ended in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi
today with a call for reducing the child mortality in the region.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which was attended by representatives from the
seven member states of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), passed the Rawalpindi Resolution requesting
members to cut the infant mortality rate to below 50 per 1,000
births by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged member states to cut the mortality rate of
children under age of five to below 70 per 1,000 births by 2000
and the maternal mortality rate by at least a half from the 1990
level.
</P>
<P>
It said at least 80 percent of primary-school-age children must
complete their primary education by 2000 in the SAARC region,
which comprises Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, the
Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Other goals set for the year 2000 included a universal access
to safe drinking water and sanitary means of excreta disposal in
the member countries.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, the resolution called for establishing
social support systems for children, launching a comprehensive
nutrition initiative and combating intra-country child
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also set goals for the year 2010, including
setting up a sustainable social and physical environment in both
rural and urban areas, cutting the under-five child mortality rate
to below 35 per 1,000 births and the maternal mortality rate to
100 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
It called for reducing adult and adolescent illiteracy and
eliminating gender imbalance in the social parameters in South
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The three-day ministerial conference on children in South Asia
was the third such meeting following the first in New Delhi in
1986 and the second in Colombo in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Lawmakers Condemn Israeli Ban on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Council (PC)
members today strongly condemned the Israeli authorities for
banning Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat's
helicopter from flying to the West Bank town of Ramallah from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was scheduled to meet opposition Labor Chairman and
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres in Ramallah this afternoon,
according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in east Jerusalem. In protest against the trouble, Arafat and
Peres decided to meet in Gaza this evening.
</P>
<P>
At a council session dominated by debate on the incident, 37
angry PC members took the floor to slam the Israeli act.
</P>
<P>
PC Speaker Abu Ala, architect of the Oslo Accords, said that
Israel hurt the dignity of every Palestinian and the PA. He added
that it also attacked Arafat's authority and his right to run
Palestinian affairs and constituted an obstacle to Palestinian
interests.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel keeps on violating the peace accord, I find no
interest in pursuing the negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PC members decided to send a delegation composed of the
speaker and heads of 11 committees to meet Arafat in Gaza for
consultation over the issue. They also called for an urgent joint
meeting of the PC, Palestine National Council and PA cabinet.

<HEADLINE> IMF Agrees to Release $330 Million Payment for Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 22 (Xinhua) -- An official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) today confirmed that the IMF
Board of Executive Directors has agreed to release delayed 330
million U.S. dollar payment to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The monthly payment for July is part of a 10.2 billion dollar
loan, that had been held up due to the IMF's concerns about
Russian compliance with the institution's terms.
</P>
<P>
The huge three-year loan was approved by the IMF's board in
March this year in support of Russia's economic reforms. The
amount is the second largest the IMF has ever offered for its
member countries following its approval of the record 17.8 billion
dollar loan to help Mexico get rid of its financial crisis in the
first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The loan is disbursed on monthly basis after the IMF's
24-member board reviewing Russia's data files and compliance. An
IMF spokesman said discussions are currently underway in Moscow on
this year's second quarterly and fifth monthly review, which is
expected to be forwarded for the Board's consideration in
mid-September.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Study Domestic Migration Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
form a task force to conduct a study on the state of internal
migration in the country, Population Minister Prakash Man Singh
said today.
</P>
<P>
The issue of migration should not be ignored when talking about
population management, and it will do the country no good to have
too many migrants, Singh told parliament today.
</P>
<P>
He said rural development should be emphasized to remove
regional imbalances so that fewer people would migrate within the
country.
</P>
<P>
The study on the reasons behind migration and its impact on
social and economic environment will be available within one
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is to work out policies and plans to control
internal migration on the basis of the study, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the government's efforts towards on population control,
Nepal's population growth rate has dropped to 2.1 percent annually
in recent years from 2.66 percent recorded earlier.
</P>
<P>
A 1991 census in Nepal showed the country's population stood at
about 18 million while the latest estimates put the figure at
nearly 21 million.

<HEADLINE> China to Inject Huge Investment in Industrial Zone Construction (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China plans to inject at least
250 billion yuan building a modern industrial zone in north
China's Tianjin, a leading industrial port city within the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Ye Disheng, vice-mayor of Tianjin, told Xinhua today that the
zone will be sited on a site of more than 300 square kilometers
along coastal eastern Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
The vice-mayor said that the ambitious project has been
approved by relevant departments of the central government, and
since the construction of 10 major infrastructure projects got
underway, a modern industrial park, which has lured overseas
investment exceeding six billion US dollars, and a two-sq-km
bonded zone have taken initial shape.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin New Economic Zone, which is still under construction,
takes in Tianjin Harbor, the largest international trade port
in north China, the country's largest bonded zone and another
three industrial zones.
</P>
<P>
The area's annual gross industrial output value has topped 40
billion yuan and still maintains an annual growth rate of more
than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the area's domestic gross product (GDP) is
expected to exceed 100 billion yuan by the year 2003, accounting
for half of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
And its economic scale, imports and exports, and overseas
investment equals the much-publicized Pudong New Area in China's
business center of Shanghai, experts added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhifeng, director of Tianjin Coastal Region Development
Office, said that the new industrial zone will give priority to
the construction of chemical, metallurgical, machinery and
electrical industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the zone will rely on the Tianjin city proper and
Beijing, which is about 100 km away, in finance, trade, science
and technology, and information services.
</P>
<P>
Tao Jianhua, professor of Tianjin University, said that some
100 economists, after scientific reasoning, concluded that the
project to build a new industrial zone along the coastal area of
Tianjin is highly feasible, a view shared by a number of
world-renowned consultancy and assessment organizations.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative consulting company from Canada said that this
part of the city has developed transportation facilities, a solid
industrial base and bright market prospects.

<TEXT>
<P>
About 190 out of the world's top 500 enterprises have made
investments in the area, indicating prospects are bright for modern
industrial construction.
</P>
<P>
Besides, this part of the city has ample supplies of such
resources as oil, gas, thermal heat and raw salt. The reserves of
oil and natural gas in Bohai and Dagang stand at 1.5 billion tons
and 20 billion cubic meters, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, there are 20,000 hectares of waste land
and 30,000 hectares of shoals remaining to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there are many convenient transport facilities
including Tianjin Port, the largest foreign trade port in
North China, and Tianjin Airport, the largest cargo airport in the
country. The city is also well connected with other parts of the
country through railway and highway networks.
</P>
<P>
The vast northern and northwestern regions, with over 200
million population, are a huge market for Tianjin, while the rich
technological and labor resources in Beijing and Tianjin give
strong support to the zone's development.
</P>
<P>
The huge investment program has aroused great interest among
domestic and overseas investors. This year, Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of
China have provided nearly two billion yuan in loans to Tianjin for
infrastructure work, which has increased the new zone's total
infrastructural investment to 2.5 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of overseas heavyweights, including
Motorola, AT&AMP;T, Samsung, LG and Nestle have increased their
investments in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, this part of the city
drew a total overseas investment of 1.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dong Dalin, a famous Chinese economist recently inspected the
new area and reported that he believed the construction of the
area will greatly boost the economic construction and shorten the
gap in economic development between southern and northern
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Disabled Sports USA has
lodged a protest decrying the groupings at the Paralympics that
pitted double below-the-knee leg amputees against arm amputees in
women's long jump, after their athelete Aimee Mullins finished
last in Wednesday's competition.
</P>
<P>
Mullins, a double below-the-knee amputee, used her metal legs
to jump 10 feet and 3.5 inches, the best jump among female double
below-the-knee amputees.
</P>
<P>
But that was no match to the distance a below-the-elbow arm
amputees can jump with flesh-and-blood legs. Irina Leontiouk of
Belarus, a below-the-elbow amputee, leaped 18 feet and 8.5 inches
to walk away with the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"This is supposed to be fair," said Mullins, the only female
double below-the-knee amputee who was also last in her 100 meter
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"When you are missing a wrist, it really doesn't do that much
damage to the way you run. It's like me doing the uneven bars in
gymnastics with them. Of course I'm going to beat them."
</P>
<P>
Disabled Sports USA had protested the grouping of amputees to
the International Paralympic Commitee, but the protest was turned
down.
</P>
<P>
"They say there is insufficient numbers of female athletes,"
said Ed Harrison, spokesperson for the Disabled Sports USA.

<HEADLINE> China Issues rules to Control Imported Camera Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration for
Industry and Commerce today issued rules to bring the confusing
camera market under order.
</P>
<P>
The "Administrative Methods on the Market of Imported Cameras",
will mean that all imported cameras have to be registered by the
administration and should carry a registration label.
</P>
<P>
Shops selling imported cameras must be licensed by the
administration. Any unit or individual dealing in unregistered
foreign cameras will be punished according to the rules.
</P>
<P>
The administration started a nationwide registration scheme
last August, according to Gan Guoping, Deputy Director of the
state administration. So far 1,731 firms have been granted
licenses, and over 1.91 million imported cameras have already been
registered.
</P>
<P>
China's camera market has long been hampered by the large
quantity of smuggled cameras brought in. It has forced most of the
country's camera factories to close down. At present, there are
less than 10 domestic camera makers in China, and only one of them
is profitable.
</P>
<P>
The situation has also scared away many overseas camera
manufacturers from cooperating with local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 alone, camera smuggling led to two billion yuan losses
to the state. The sum is enough to set up 10 large camera
factories with a yearly output value of three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new rules is not designed to limit
the normal import of cameras, but aimed at cracking down on camera
smuggling, and protecting legal imports, said Wang Leyi, State
Office on Anti-Smuggling Affairs and Deputy Director of General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the new rules will help create a
sound camera market for domestic and overseas manufacturers to
compete on an equal footing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the
central bank of the country, today decided to reduce interest
rates of both loans and deposits beginning on August 23.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such reduction this year. The central bank
lowered the interest rates on May 1.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the interest rate of deposits will
drop by an average 1.5 percentage points, while the interest rate
of loans will go down by 1.2 percentage points on average. At the
same time, interest rate of deposits by all banks and banking
institutions will also be reasonably readjusted.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, an senior official at the central
bank stressed that the reduction is by no means an indication that
the bank has given give up its policy of keeping a reasonably
tight currency supply.
</P>
<P>
The policy of the central bank is to maintain the stability of
the currency's value to boost economic growth, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The level of interest is an important policy tool of the
central bank to conduct macro-control in line with the development
of the national economy, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the May 1 interest-cut has received a
positive response from the people, and since then the savings have
been increasing steadily, while the interest burden of enterprises
has been eased, which has played an active role in pushing forward
the sustained, speedy and healthy development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the official pointed out, resolving the problem of the
declining performance of state-owned enterprises can not merely
rely on the overall loosening of money supply, and the
macro-economic policy of maintaining a reasonable tight money
supply should continue to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The official demanded that all banking institutions must
strictly follow the administrative rules on bank interest
stipulated by the People's Bank of China. Illegal raising of
interest under any names are strictly prohibited, the official
stressed.

ADDIS ABABA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern African Countries (COMESA)
have been urged to improve quality of their goods to
face fierce competition in the world.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by COMESA Secretary General Bingu Wa
Mutharika at a one-day seminar entitled "Doing Business in
COMESA" here.
</P>
<P>
In his message read out by his representative at the seminar,
Mutharika said member countries could not do good business in the
organization if they do not have goods and services of high
quality which are competitive internationally.
</P>

Mutharika said the COMESA should make the chambers of commerce
and industry and any other business sector organizations more
functional towards the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the seminar is to strengthen individual
chambers of commerce and other business organizations to assist
the export and import oriented business communities in their

The use of the practical technologies such as land terracing,

agriculture, have been introduced on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
Qiao spoke highly of the advanced techniques, adding that
agriculture previously depending on natural conditions will
be gradually updated with the new techniques.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the rainfall in the province is comparatively
sufficient for grain production, and a good harvest expected this
year. He urged the local government to take a long-term view of
grain production, noting that China has a large population, but a
scarcity of arable land.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of state-owned enterprises, Qiao said that those
enterprises in the province, most of which were set up in the
1950s, have contributed greatly to the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Under new circumstances Qiao said, the only way for those
enterprises to march forward was to deepen reform.
</P>
<P>
He said that the upgrading of technology by the enterprises,
especially the older ones, should receive more attention to help
them become more competitive.

<HEADLINE> ICBC, Shanghai Auto Group Sign Cooperative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), one of the country's largest commercial
banks, today signed a cooperative agreement with Shanghai
Automobile Industry Group (SAIC) to support the development of the
automobile industry in the city.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the bank will offer a loan of 500 million
yuan to the group to expand production and sales, and another one
billion yuan to its sales agents and other authorized Santana
sedan dealers.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, ICBC
is also planning to provide mortgage loans for car purchasing, by
offering 400 million yuan for Santana car buyers.
</P>
<P>
Xie Duyang, vice president of ICBC, said at the signing
ceremony today that the loan will be helpful not only to expand
China's auto industry, in particular the production and sales of
SAIC, but also to establish long-term and stable cooperative
relations between banks and large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the Shanghai branch of ICBC in recent
years has provided a total of one billion yuan to SAIC for
technical renovations and the setting up of its financial company.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, sales of SAIC reached 52.4 billion yuan,
taking 14 percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales. The
enterprise manufactured 160,000 Santana sedans and earned a profit
of 5.4 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources revealed that the group this year plans to produce over
200,000 Santana sedans with a sales of 58 billion yuan, and a
profit of six billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, ICBC's saving deposit totaled 1,657.8
billion yuan, up 197.5 billion yuan from the beginning of the
year; its loan deposits topped 1,512.6 billion yuan, increasing 82
billion yuan over the level in January.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Wheat Output Falls Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The wheat output of Hungary
fell drastically this year owing to weak government support for
agriculture, the media here reported today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the wheat output declined by 30 percent
this year. The output of the whole country totaled some 3.5
million tons with an average of 3.2 tons per hectare. In
contrast, the output of last year stood between 4.5-6 tons.
</P>
<P>
Apart from bad weather conditions, the financial constraints of
farmers were mainly blamed for the decreased wheat output this
year, said Kis Zoltan, state secretary of the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He added that the output was also adversely affected by the
practice of farmers in some regions, who were reluctant to apply
additional but necessary fertilizers and pesticides to crops in an
attempt to save production cost.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Agricultural Association Csikai Miklos
criticized the Agriculture Ministry for its failure to raise
enough money for this year's wheat production.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of funds, many farmers even had no money to
buy fine seeds, said Uhertsak Andras, an agricultural expert from
the Federation of the Agricultural Cooperator and Individual
Laborer.
</P>
<P>
The average output per hectare should have reached 4.5-5 tons
this year provided proper measures had been taken, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Airline Achieves Profit Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Australia's flag carrier Qantas
Airways Ltd. posted a bigger net profit than in prospectus in the
first year after it was sold to public share holders, Qantas said.
</P>
<P>
The airlines announced an after-tax profit of 246.7 million
Australian dollars (195.1 million U.S. dollars) for the fiscal
year ending on June 30 this year, an increase of 36.8 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The figure was 4.1 percent higher than the prospectus forecast.
</P>
<P>
The airlines achieved a total revenue of 7.6 billion Australian
dollars (6.0 billion U.S. dollars) through expanding its capacity
by 6.6 percent and adding three new aircraft to its fleet during
the year.
</P>
<P>
It also managed to increase cost savings by 175 million
Australian dollars (138 million U.S. dollars) to 468 million
Australian dollars (370 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was achieved through improved aircraft utilization,
reduction in operating and handling costs and more efficient
spending on in-flight services, sales and marketing support, said
Qantas.
</P>
<P>
The airlines maintained the prospectus target of giving a
dividend of 6.5 cents per share to investors by the end of the
year, in addition to a dividend of 3.5 cents per share paid in mid
year.
</P>
<P>
Qantas saw weaker turnovers in its Japan and New Zealand routes
during the year, but they were more than offset by higher returns
from the route groups of Britain, Europe, North East Asia and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The airlines said it expects a lower revenue growth and a
stronger Australian dollar in the next 12 months. It will work to
secure its profit target through further cost savings next year,
though its market share is likely to fall.
</P>
<P>
Qantas now holds 53 percent of Australia's domestic market and
39.1 percent of the country's international market.
</P>
<P>
It will open a new Sydney-Shanghai route to China later this
month in addition to the existing
Melbourne-Sydney-Guangzhou-Beijing route.
</P>
<P>
It is facing intensifying competition after the Australian air
services authority began to allocate international flight rights
to other airlines such as Ansett.
</P>
<P>
The airlines would be cautious to make capital investment,
while maintaining the priority of profit over market share in the
coming year, Qantas Chairman Gary Pemberton said.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Unemployment Rate Hits Lowest Level in 4 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in
Romania has dropped to 6.4 percent, the lowest in four years, said
the the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest ministry statistics, the jobless rate
went down to 9.4 percent in March from 10.4 percent early last
year.
</P>
<P>
At present a total of 800,000 people in Romania are out of
work, 200,000 less than in last year.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government took various measures to curb
unemployment. The special anti-unemployment campaign carried out
early this year helped reduce unemployment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment varies in different areas. In the capital of
Bucharest and western parts of Romania, the unemployment rate is
lower with Bucharest at 4.4 percent and Timis at 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the less developed eastern and northern parts of the
country, the unemployment rate reached more than 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has distributed 150 billion leu (47.3 million
U.S. dollars) worth of unemployment subsidies to 12 counties with
the highest jobless rate.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises other than state-owned ones and those in the
tertiary industry like tourism have absorbed many unemployed
people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the government have encouraged private-owned
enterprises and others in the transportation and tourism sectors
to hire the unemployed. As a result, big department stores,
parking lots and gas stations have employed many jobless people as
security guards and management staff.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government has also been trying to improve the
service sector to increase employment. Job-seeking agencies that
are popular across the country have formed an organized and
well-managed network of employment service nationwide.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 million people have been employed or re-employed
through the network since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest alone, job-seeking agencies have succeeded in
helping more than 33,000 people find jobs. Besides, vocational
training centers and schools have contributed to a brisk labor
market and a better trained labor force in Romania.

He urged the local government to pay more attention to
improving research and the living conditions of researchers,
and to train more young people in high technologies.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned the job of the provincial NPC and the
building up of the Party's style of work. He reiterated that Party
members should take no special interest in themselves, but work in
the interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged grassroots cadres to link more closely with the
masses to help them out of poverty as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the Party and the State care about the economic
development in the western and central parts of China and have
adopted a series of measures to accelerate the economic
development of the regions.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the economic development of the western and
central parts of the country are restricted by historical and
natural conditions in economic development.
</P>
<P>
He urged local officials to take a long-term view of their
jobs, noting that there is still a long way to go to change the
poor conditions of the regions.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the eastern and coastal provinces, Gansu is a
comparatively poor province, he said, adding that the poverty will
be eliminated through the continuous deepening of reform and
opening up.

<HEADLINE> Share of Books And Information Urged by Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Books and information stored in
libraries across the world should be accessible to a larger
population with the help of electronic technology, a noted
American librarian said here today.
</P>
<P>
The International Federation of Library Associations and
Institutions (IFLA) is working to complete IFLANET, a worldwide
electronic network of books which enables people in different
places to share more information, said Robert Wedgeworth,
president of IFLA.
</P>
<P>
The process means more opening-up of and exchanges between
countries, he noted, adding that Libraries in more than 90
countries are now online.
</P>
<P>
Wedgeworth, also the head of Library of Illinois University,
will attend IFLA's 62nd general conference, which opens August 25
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The librarian pointed out that the world has entered a new era
of information, and new technology will benefit libraries and
readers in various aspects. The use of advanced technology will
enable them to meet the challenge of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wedgeworth said that the information era does not mean the
giving up of printing and reading, but because more information
and documents are located in different cities and places,
libraries should overcome geographical and time barriers.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the development of libraries varies
greatly from place to place in the world; many countries still
lack libraries, librarians and materials.
</P>
<P>
Electronic technology will allow people to bridge gaps between
information distribution and share more information, the librarian
said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming meeting will highlight issues that affect society
in the turn-of-the-century information.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese information specialists also pointed out that the
specific condition of a country and its own cultural traditions
should be considered when making full use of information
technology to transmit knowledge and to serve economic
development.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Customs and
Excise Department is inviting the United States Customs officers
to visit Hong Kong to observe its textiles export control systems.
</P>
<P>
The invitation, made in response to the additional import
measures imposed with effect from June 17 on 10 categories of Hong
Kong apparel products, is part of Hong Kong's continuing efforts
to persuade the US Customs that these extra measures are
unnecessary, a government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the visit program will last for 30
days, starting from September 2. Eight U.S. Customs officers will
observe the operation of Hong Kong's various textiles export
control systems in respect of the 10 categories in question.
</P>
<P>
"In the invitation, we told the U.S. side that we hope that
after having observed our systems at work under the program, the
U.S. Customs will share our view that Hong Kong has an effective
and vigorous system against illegal textiles transshipment," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the additional import measures imposed on Hong
Kong's 10 categories are unnecessary and should be terminated.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the visit program will prove a constructive way
of getting round the two sides' difference over the matter of
joint verification," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, "If not, we will consider other options, including
referring the matter to the World Trade Organization (WTO)."
</P>
<P>
The 10 categories in question include dresses, skirts,
nightwear, underwear, and suits.
</P>
<P>
Since June 17, the categories of Hong Kong products have been
subject to additional import measures imposed by the U.S. Customs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that these measures are adversely
affecting legitimate Hong Kong and U.S. traders, and disrupting
Hong Kong-U.S. trade in those products. They also infringe on Hong
Kong's rights under the WTO, he said.

100 colleges and universities near 400 Japanese language experts
since then. The practice was supported by the Nippon Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Higher Oil Price Helps Lower Kuwaiti Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Higher oil prices in the
world market during the past year have helped Kuwait lower its
government budget deficit than it was expected for 1996, a Kuwaiti
commercial bank said in a quarterly economic review.
</P>
<P>
The Economic and Financial Quarterly published Wednesday by the
National Bank of Kuwait, the largest commercial bank in this Gulf
state, said that "the average realized price for Kuwaiti crude
during the past fiscal year of 1995-96 ending on June 30 was in
the neighborhood of 15 U.S. dollars" per barrel, higher than the
expected level budgeted for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"The windfall gains should help lower the budget deficit below
1 billion Kuwait dinars (3.3 billion U.S. dollars)," the review
added.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentarian, Adnan Abdul Samad, who heads a parliamentary
team studying the government's draft budget for next fiscal year
said last week that oil revenues in the country have increased by
68.3 million dinars (225.39 million dollars) after meeting
expenditure involved in capping oil fires.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices for the remainder of 1996 are expected to remain
above 13 dollars per barrel projected in the budget and the
government spending will remain fairly stable, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Recent statements by Kuwaiti Minister of Finance Nasser
al-Rowdhan even put the deficit below 500 million dinars (1.65
billion dollars) due to the lower-than-expected state spending and
higher-than-expected oil prices. The figure is less than half of
the budgeted deficit.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank said "serious measures to tackle the deficit
remain a necessity," adding that "it would be quite risky if the
current fortuitous drop in the deficit were to give the government
a false sense of comfort and reduce the sense of urgency for
introducing structural changes outlined in the five-year plan for
eliminating the deficit by the year 2000."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's recent budgets have been based on an oil price of 13
dollars a barrel for this country's crude oil, but for most of the
past 18 months, the price has been 15 dollars or above.
</P>
<P>
It is officially estimated that the Kuwaiti projected revenues
for 1996-97 fiscal year are expected to reach 3 billion dinars
(9.9 billion dollars), which is 90 million dinars (297 million
dollars) in excess of the projected revenues for the fiscal year
of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
A share of 85.3 percent of the projected revenues for 1996-97
fiscal year would be from oil, amounting to 2.6 billion dinars
(8.58 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The firm prices also helped Kuwait raise gross domestic
product (GDP) by 8 percent and gross national product (GNP) by 13
percent in 1995.

announced here today that it has formed a strategic alliance with
a group of mainland organizations which will form the basis of its
plans to bid for concessions at Hong Kong's new airport and to
expand in China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, called DFS China Partners Ltd., is a joint
venture between the DFS Group, China Travel Service and the
Diaoyutai State Guest House. The Bank of China Hong Kong and Macao
Regional Office has agreed to be an adviser to the board of the
new company, a spokesman for DFS said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman and chief executive officer of DFS Group, Myron E
Ullman, said "The formation of the company is an expression of our
confidence in the future of the travel industry in Hong Kong and
in China."
</P>
<P>
He said that the first project of the company will be preparing
bids for the retail concessions at Hong Kong's new airport which
are due to be put to tender in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Within China, DFS is already a supplier and management
consultant to the China National Duty Free Merchandise Corporation
for the operation of the Beijing Downtown Duty Free Shop.
</P>
<P>
DFS was founded in Hong Kong in 1961 and claims to be the
world's largest operator of retail travel stores.

<P>
CAIRO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
met with visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda today
for talks on bilateral relations and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
No details have been available about the meeting, which took
place in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, the second
largest city of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But the local press reported earlier today that the meeting
would particularly deal with the joint construction of a bridge
over the Suez Canal, the waterway which links the Mediterranean
and the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have announced that Japan will spend 83
million U.S. dollars to cover about 60 percent of the bridge's
cost, and Egypt will pay about 56 million dollars. A construction
tender will be offered in November.
</P>
<P>
The four-kilometer bridge is to be built near the town of
El-Ferdan, 130 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Now a single tunnel carries automobile traffic under the canal,
but most vehicles go by ferry.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda, who arrived in Cairo Tuesday night on a three-day visit
to Egypt, held talks with Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Ikeda also initialed an agreement to grant
Egypt 11.7 million dollars for the expansion of a fishing
port at the village of Maadia, some 30 kilometers east of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
The grant brings to 954.5 billion yen (889.8 million dollars)
Japanese assistance to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first leg of Ikeda's Middle East tour that will
also take him to Syria, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule area of the Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Stranded Whales Leave Australia's Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A pod of 300 pilot whales, 200
of which had tried to beach themselves off a resort town in
Western Australia state, are now safe in deep water, authorities
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) is
confident that the pod is out of danger, CALM Executive Director
Syd Shea was quoted by a media release as saying in Perth, a port
city in the southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Scores of volunteers and wildlife authorities took part in a
15-hour rescue effort starting on 21:00 local time (11:00 GMT)
Tuesday to save about 200 whales stranded in the shallows off
Dunsborough, 300 kilometers south of Perth.
</P>
<P>
CALM wildlife officer Charlie Broadbent said the scenes were
horrific when the animals, measuring up to five meters long, were
first discovered.
</P>
<P>
"The animals were thrashing around and the water was red with
blood, as they cut themselves on the rocks. The noise was
unbelievable. It was just like being in a piggery with more than
200 squealing pigs," Broadbent said.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that "pilot whales are well known for traveling in
herds from several hundred to 1,000 and their ability to beach
themselves makes rescue operations much harder."
</P>
<P>
The last mass stranding of whales in the state took place in
1988 when 114 false killer whales beached themselves in a remote
area 500 kilometers south of Perth.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Crime Campaign to be Continued, Deepened (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Marked achievements have been
made since China launched its nationwide anti-crime campaign four
months ago.
</P>
<P>
The drive started in April when police vowed to crack several
major criminal cases, capture a large number of escaped prisoners,
and battle relentlessly against gangs.
</P>
<P>
At the second session of the Standing Committee of the sixth
National People's Congress in September 1983, several laws were
passed, including the Decision on Severely Punishing Offenders Who
Seriously Jeopardize Public Security, and the Decision on Promptly
Trying Criminal Offenders Who Jeopardize Public Security.
</P>
<P>
Since then because of growing problems with public security,
China's law enforcement departments have organized a swift and
severe crackdown on crime in accordance with law, with the
frequency and scope of the campaign depending continuously.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua in Beijing today, a senior official
with the Ministry of Public Security said that China is scheduled
to "continue and deepen the campaign in accordance with the law,"
in a move to safeguard the smooth carrying out of its opening-up
drive and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
"Globally, China has always been one of the countries with the
lowest crime rate," he said. "However, as China engages itself in
building a socialist market economy, the flow of personnel, funds
and materials has been accelerated."
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in people's concept of values
and mode of behavior, he added, and "as a result, the social
environment is less satisfactory than before."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a new social mechanism which can effectively control
those problems has not emerged. To some extent, this imposes a
negative impact on the prevention of criminal activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As political and social stability is such an important issue
to a country, no government of the world can be indifferent to
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese president Jiang Zemin, who is also General secretary of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, has repeated the
philosophy that "without stability, nothing can be accomplished."

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Urged to Realize Direct Links Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the State Council said in Beijing today that the
direct exchange of mail service, trade, air and shipping services
across the Taiwan Straits represents the interests and urgent
demands of the people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with journalists, the spokesman said it is his
hope that the Taiwan authorities will go with the aspirations of
people across the straits in order to realize the direct exchange
of the three services at an early date. This will promote the
common prosperity on both sides of the straits, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We always stand for the realization of this goal, which is
conducive to the development of personnel exchange and economic
cooperation between the two sides of the straits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, personnel exchanges and economic
cooperation and trade have grown rapidly, thanks to the concerted
efforts by business people and others who live on the two sides of
the straits. This situation made it necessary to establish a
sea transportation market and make it standardized.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the promulgation of separate
regulations on the management of direct passenger and cargo
shipping business, and managing cargo transport agents,
demonstrates that the direct shipping links should be carried out
in accordance with the principles of one-China, two-way direct
shipping service and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The documents define clearly that direct cargo transport
between harbors on the Chinese mainland and Taiwan is regarded as
domestic transportation under special management.
</P>
<P>
Shipping companies and cargo canvassing companies across the
straits will be managed in accordance with regulations and laws,
he added.
</P>
<P>
This will not only safeguard the interests of shipping
transport, but also benefit the normal and orderly development of
economic cooperation, trade and exchanges across the straits, the
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines had a population
of 68,614,162 at midnight on August 31, 1995, President Fidel
Ramos announced at a meeting here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official count of the 1995 national population
census, the figure represents an increase of 7.91 million over the
1990 census figure of 60.7 million.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the new figure "brings us the good news that the
population growth rate has not surged alarmingly but has in fact
slightly declined since the count was made in 1990."
</P>
<P>
"In effect, the zero growth rate population will yield better
results for key economic indicators, like income and food
sufficiency on a per capita basis," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will aim for more effective
population management to give the country more time to adjust to
future population increases.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets with Pakistani Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen today met Najmuddin Sheikh, foreign secretary
of Pakistan at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China and Pakistan are close and friendly neighbors,
and there has been an excellent development of relations between
the countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have been supporting, and closely
coordinating with each other, on international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We thank Pakistan for its valuable support to China in
international affairs," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh said Pakistan and China have a profound friendship and
share many views in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The frequent consultations between the two sides are helpful
to the consolidation of understanding between us," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As to the situation in the south Asian region, the two sides
expressed the common hope that peace, stability and development
can be maintained, and that disputes should be resolved
through contact, dialogue and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh arrived in China on August 19 to attend the regular
consultations between the two countries' Foreign Ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and Sheikh
exchanged views on bilateral relations, the regional situation,
and international issues of common interest, and reached a
consensus on a wide range of topics.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Crime Campaign to be Continued, Deepened (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"People's sense of safety has improved, and China's position as
one of the countries with the lowest crime rate in the world has
been safeguarded," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has also carried out other special campaigns to
strike hard against drug trafficking, prostitution and other
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Local governments usually organize those special campaigns to
deal with the most pressing social problems in the region, with
the frequency, length and scope of the campaigns depending on
needs.
</P>
<P>
The issue of stability is the result of a variety of social
factors, therefore, the expectation to completely solve the
problem only by resorting to anti-crime campaign and those special
campaigns is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
"To solve the problem fundamentally," he said, "we have to
mobilize the whole society for the comprehensive management of
social security, and wage a long-term battle against crime."
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, the Central Committee for Comprehensive
Management of Public Security was founded in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, according to a leading official with
the committee, the comprehensive management work is scheduled to
"be focused on the nation's central task of economic construction,
with harsh anti-crime campaign as the key link."
</P>
<P>
"Emphasis will be put on the improvement of efficiency of
grassroots units, and the managerial and preventive work will be
strengthened," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central authorities have also called on local
leaders at all levels to conscientiously implement a "goal
system", by which local leaders are held responsible for regional
public security. Those who neglect their duties will be punished,
he said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen met South African Minister of Public Service
and Administrative Affairs Zola Skweyiya in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Qian said China has had close relations with the African
National Congress of South Africa, and had firmly supported the
anti-racism struggles of the South African people.
</P>
<P>
He said China was delighted that in 1994 South Africa realized
peaceful transition through democratic elections and established a
government of national unity, which marked the rebirth of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"China takes this triumph as its own," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
Skweyiya thanked China's support for the struggle of the South
African people.
</P>
<P>
"China has played an important role in movements of national
liberation around the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he had long desired to visit China, and now he
has been deeply impressed by China's economic development and
social progress.
</P>
<P>
Skweyiya arrived in China on August 20 on a nine-day visit at
the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign
Affairs.

<HEADLINE> APEC Supports Information Technology Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Support for a freer flow of
information technology products, such as computer software, is
gaining ground within the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, an APEC official said today.
</P>
<P>
Antonio T. Basilio, deputy chairman of the on-going APEC senior
officials meeting, said that APEC members are discussing the
possibility of an information technology agreement, which would
support zero tariffs for information technology products at the
World Trade Organization (WTO) level.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the agreement have progressed rapidly following
the APEC trade ministers meeting in New Zealand last month, he
told a press conference in the southern Philippine city of Davao.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the member economies have been able to identify
the possible areas that need clarification and what products are
to be covered," Basilio said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the discussions continue at the current rate of
progress, a consensus on the agreement would be reached by
November, or before the WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore in
December.
</P>
<P>
At the three-day APEC senior officials meeting that opened
Wednesday, participants are preparing a "96 Manila Action Plan"
for trade and investment liberalization in the region. The plan
is expected to be adopted by APEC leaders when they meet on
November 25 in Subic, some 80 kilometers north of Manila.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Banks Unharmed By Mighty Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The banks of the Yellow River,
China's second largest, are safe and sound in spite of heavy
flooding in recent days.
</P>
<P>
The State Flood-Relief and Drought-Control Headquarters said in
a report today that the flood peak measured 14.7 meters, 0.7
meters above the alarm level at 11 p.m. Beijing Time on August 20.
</P>
<P>
At six this morning, the water level was 0.26 meters lower than
the peak.
</P>
<P>
The water in some sections of the river was higher than the
record level, due to the silting of the river bed. Many
water-control facilities between the two banks were damaged, but
the banks remained safe.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a high flood water level will last for
some time, and that provinces along the river are closely watching
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The water level of most of the Yangtze, the longest river in
China, has lowered, but some sections of the river are hovering at
the alarm mark.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a typhoon struck Lingshui County in the island
province of Hainan, causing 12-degree winds. All coastal provinces
are increasing preparations against typhoons.

<HEADLINE> China National Symphony Orchestra to Present Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The China National Symphony
Orchestra (CNSO), a group of musicians restructured from the
Central Philharmonic Society, a leading orchestra in China, will
make its debut on September 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
Its premiere is part of a series of presentations of the '96
International Symphony Year, sponsored by China's Ministry of
Culture. The performance marks the opening of the orchestra's
first concert season, which extends from September through next
June.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, which began its restructuring early this year,
adopts the music director responsibility system, by which all of
its members are contracted instead of being endowed with an "iron
bowl" -- the traditional Chinese system that guarantees job
security to all employees of an organization.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the orchestra, a strategic step taken by China's
Ministry of Culture, has created controversy among music lovers,
professionals and critics.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra's first music director is Chen Zuohuang, a famous
conductor who is also China's first doctor of music arts, directed
several orchestras abroad.
</P>
<P>
The current 80 members of the orchestra are considered to be
the best players in the country.
</P>
<P>
Forty concerts are scheduled for the first season, including
symphonic music, chamber music, Asian music and popular music.
</P>
<P>
The orchestra will also work with world-renowed conductors
Gennady Rozhdestvensky and Charles Dutoit.

PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Horror fantasies, metamorphosis of
human being into animals and plants, war and memoir of childhood
time are the dominating topics in bestselling French novels in

Darrieusecq, whose heroine changes into a sow, and "Bamboo" by
Jean-Marc Aubert, who has its major characters transformed into

<HEADLINE> APEC Eyeing "Single Visa" for Businessmen in Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from member economies
of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum may be able
to avail themselves of the APEC Business Access Card to replace
visas early next year, the 1996 APEC News Bureau announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said the APEC Business Access Card, also called the
Smartcard, is like a credit card in lieu of a visa. The bearer of
this card will have access to all APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
All the APEC members were receptive to this proposal submitted
by Australia, according to Antonio T. Basilio, deputy chair of the
ongoing senior officials meeting of the APEC in the southern
Philippine city of Davao.
</P>
<P>
However, its implementation would not start until probably
early next year due to some technical and legal requirements of
different economies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All the other APEC economies are studying it because each of
them have different immigration rules and visa requirements,"
Basilio said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Australia is expected to be the first in
implementing the card while Singapore, Thailand and South Korea
have expressed interests in it.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the Philippines lacks the necessary
technical requirements for the Smartcard, it will probably come up
with a multi-year, multiple entry visa.
</P>
<P>
As for Japan and the United States, which have problems with
illegal migrants and whose laws require a visa for foreign
businessmen, Basilio said that they will have to institute
safeguards or enter into bilateral agreements on these visas.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges More Sino-foreign Cooperation in Power Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
urged the German company Siemens and US Foster Wheeler to expand
cooperation with China in the power sector on the basis of
equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Premier made the remark this morning when meeting with
representatives of the two companies in the Diaoyutai state
guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the two companies came to the Chinese
capital to sign a contract with the China Electric Power
Technology Import and Export Corp. and the Yangcheng International
Power Co. Ltd. to jointly develop the Yangcheng Power Plant
project in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, China will import six 350-MW generating
units, worth 720 million US dollars, from the two companies.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that one of the country's important policies
guiding the development of energy resources is the building of
pit-mouth power plants in the coal production bases. The Yangcheng
power plant is the first such project which spans provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Premier added that upon completion of the project, all of
the power to be produced by the plant will be sent to east
China's Jiangsu Province, a major economic powerhouse of the
country. This is considered to be an important step in carrying
out the principle of changing the transport of coal into
transmission of power in China's energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Li told the foreign guests that as China's demand for
electricity is huge, great potential exists for Sino-foreign
cooperation in the power sector. He added that China has a
successful record of cooperation with Siemens and Foster Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese and foreign power enterprises to conduct
greater cooperation and compete fairly as they develop China's
power sector.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader stressed that the Chinese government will
provide buying credits for Chinese electric machinery
manufacturers to sharpen their competitive edge, adding that the
best way for foreign companies to win orders in China is they
cooperate with their Chinese counterparts. This will help to tap
each other's advantages and cut production costs on the basis of
mutual benefit and common development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese vice-premier Wu Bangguo attended the contract signing
ceremony today in the Great Hall of the People for importing
Siemens' steam turbine generating sets and Foster Wheeler's
boilers.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the first construction phase of the plant
project, with installed generating capacity of 2,100 mw, is
scheduled for operation in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government softened its position defended by
Prime Minister Alain Juppe and his interior minister Jean-Louis
Debre in the affair of the 300 illegal immigrants, deciding to ask
the Council of State to evaluate the application of the Pasqua
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand people in Paris went to the streets Wednesday
afternoon to support the hunger strikers who have been occupying
the Saint-Bernard Church for nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
-- The Chechen capital Grozny could gain a rest after General
Alexander Lebed made a mediation mission Wednesday evening, which
ended with a ceasefire agreement with the chief of staff of the
Chechen forces Aslan Maskahdov. "I went to Grozny to bring calm
back," claimed Lebed after meeting Maskadhov.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ultimatum imposed by Russian troops is to expire
this morning. If the rebels have not evacuated from Grozny by
dawn, a major assault by Russian troops will begin.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- General Alexander Lebed tried to avoid a bloodbath in Grozny
by obtaining a reprieve from the Russian commander in Chechny, who
is preparing a major assault on the city. Russian artillery began
to pound Grozny while Lebed was meeting with the chief of staff of
the rebels Aslan Maskhadov, who agreed to observe a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of inhabitants of Grozny continued to flee the city.
But 200,000 civilians remain there.
</P>
<P>
-- The Mexican government has sacked 737 police officers and
subordinates for corruption and law-breaking. The law enforcers
are contributing to the rise of crime rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
-- Four months after the massacre of nearly 100 Lebanese
civilians by Israeli bombardments in the southern Lebanese town of
Cana, the place has become a tourist attraction, drawing Lebanese
from all parts of the country to pay homage to the victims. The
Hezbollah guerrillas have become the champion of the fight against
Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Sherpa Women Move out of Secluded Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sherpa woman Cedan Lhamo makes no
secret of her joyful and proud feelings when she talks about the
great changes of the life of her people.
</P>
<P>
"Through our hard work we have managed to change the tradition
that men acted as masters and women were meant just to serve," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sherpa people used to live in deep mountains along the
bordering areas of Nepal, Sikkim and China's Tibet Autonomous
Region. Normally they have Tibetan blood and follow Tibetan
culture.
</P>
<P>
Cedan Lhamo has become chairwoman of the Women's Union in Zham
Town of Nyalam County, and a member of the Standing Committee of
Tibet Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
For Cedan 1972 was a turning point. She was recommended to
attend the Central Institute for Nationalities. After five years
in this highest learning institute for people from various ethnic
groups, she returned to her hometown to begin a new life.
</P>
<P>
With a persistent and pioneering spirit, she puts much energy
into protecting the rights and interests of local women and
children and has won their respect.
</P>
<P>
"In old Tibet, Sherpa people used to endure unbearable
hardships like other serfs in Tibet," 46-year-old Cedan said,
adding that women in particular had even no rights in their own
homes.
</P>
<P>
"Those who tasted no bitterness never know what is sweet," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Like Cedan Lhamo, Danzim helps to enrich the cultural life of
more than 1,700 local people in the town. She had little
schooling, but managed to acquire much knowledge about radio and
television broadcast through her own efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Sherpa people have only a language but no written
characters. A poor cultural life and little scientific knowledge
have greatly restricted their social progress and economic
development, Danzim said.
</P>
<P>
Stepping out of the restraint of deep mountains has been a
long-time aspiration of the natives, and their wish is being
realized, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Now many Sherpa women study in higher-learning schools, and act
as government employees, technicians or business women.
</P>
<P>
Cering Yuzhin is one of successful business women. In 1982, she
and her husband arrived in Zham, the only state-level land port
which greatly promotes links between Tibet and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
They carried products of light industry to Nepal and brought in
food and handicrafts. With their hard work during the past decade,
they have accumulated considerable wealth.
</P>
<P>
Last year, they constructed a four-story building in the most
bustling area in Zham Town and rent it out.
</P>
<P>
As for their children, they sent one son to a lamasery and
three to school.
</P>
<P>
Asked who makes decisions at home, Cering Yuzhin said with a
smile that the matter is not important, as long as the decision is
right.
</P>
<P>
"We respect and support each other, maybe this is the secret of
our success," she added.

BANGKOK, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Special branch police and guards
have stepped up security at the Thai Interior Ministry following
reports of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles and visitors are strictly checked at the ministry's
gate.
</P>
<P>
With jurisdiction covering the police department and the
country's 76 provinces, the Interior Ministry is the most
important of all ministries and is known as "the mini-cabinet."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa is concurrently the interior
minister.
</P>
<P>
The deputy permanent secretary of the ministry, Chaiwat
Hutacharoen, said the ministry's intelligence unit had learned
that an unidentified group of people were planning to sabotage the
ministry to discredit the government.
</P>
<P>
The tighter security has been imposed since Tuesday when a
meeting was called to discuss preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
There has long been pressure from Banharn's own Chart Thai
(Thai Nation) Party for him to give up the interior minister's
post.

<HEADLINE> Help, Donations Urged for Old Revolutionary Base Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese revolutionary
veterans have urged more aid be provided to former revolutionary
bases in a move to promote their economic development.
</P>
<P>
People in these remote, mountainous areas had offered great
support to the Chinese Communist Party and contributed greatly to
the liberation cause before the new China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Now out of 65 million people who suffer from poverty, at
least 30 million live in former base areas.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, put forward by General Li Desheng and 10 other
members of the "China Society for Promoting Construction of Old
Liberated Areas," has won support from residents in Shanghai and
some provinces.
</P>
<P>
Many organizations and individuals have donated money and
clothes, and signed contracts to provide economic aid to
reconstruct these poor areas.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Hope Project Office has signed a letter of intent
to build 10 Hope Schools and a training center for teachers and
technical personnel in the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Hope Schools are designed to help dropouts return to the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
Cai Linfang, a private business owner, has donated 300,000 yuan
to build a school in Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
To help local people get rid of poverty, many of China's senior
leading officials, generals and scholars have volunteered to
organize the society that will help aid the revolutionary bases.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the United Nations praised their efforts.
</P>
<P>
During the eighth "Five-Year Plan" (1991-1995), the number of
poverty-stricken people in the country fell to 65 million from the
85 million reported in the seventh "Five-Year Plan" (1986-1990).

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Vows to Check Factional Fighting in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The new chief of the West African
Peacekeeping Force in Liberia known as ECOMOG has vowed to expand
ECOMOG's operations into the hinterland of the war-torn country
to stop pockets of fighting among the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before leaving for Monrovia, capital of Liberia, on
Wednesday, Major-General Sylvester Malu, the new Field Commander
of ECOMOG, said his priority was to ensure speedy redeployment of
troops to the hinterland in line with the spirit of the Abuja
Accord signed by all the warring factions and leaders of the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
He said the redeployment will depend on the fulfilment of the
promise made by leaders of member nations of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to contribute
additional troops and materials to boost ECOMOG strength.
</P>
<P>
Malu reassured that ECOMOG has taken full control of the
security in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued at the recent ECOWAS
Committee of Nine on Liberia summit, the troop strength should be
increased to put an end to the recent incidents of harassment,
abduction and assassination of civilians by rival warring
factions.
</P>
<P>
To implement the peace plan successfully, a deployment of
18,000 troops to Liberia is necessary, according to the document.
It is reported that there are some 12,000 ECOMOG soldiers
operating in Liberia at present.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional peacekeeping force is constituted by Nigeria,
Ghana, Benin, Sierra Leone, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire, with Nigeria
contributing about 8,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The new field commander, appointed only last month to replace
Major-General John Inienger, is here to attend the summit of the
ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia.  enditem

To carry out the terms of the convention, the municipal
government has taken more than 20 methods of dealing with work in
high places, use of electricity, and preventing fires, explosions,
or poisoning. In addition, contracts are supposed to be signed by
three parties - the government, the employer, and the employee.

In dealing with jobs with a high degree of accident risk, the
city has developed a safety net for bridge workers in case of an
accidental fall, and has come up with a safer electrical box to
avoid electric shock.

TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Pioneer Electronic
Corp. plans to market a car navigation system using a digital
videodisk (DVD) as early as next summer, Kyodo News Service quoted
company officials as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
DVDs can store 4.7 gigabytes of data on one side alone, about
seven times the capacity of the compact disk read-only memory
(CD-ROM) format, currently a mainstay of memory storage.
</P>
<P>
A single DVD can store all the map information required for car
navigation systems anywhere in the country as compared to seven
CD-ROM disks currently required for that amount of information.
</P>
<P>
The large-capacity disk also allows the company to add places
of historical interest, entertainment facilities, restaurants, gas
stations and other extra information to road maps.
</P>
<P>
The company expects to gain the upper hand in the growing car
navigation market by introducing a DVD-equipped model ahead of its

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The capacity of the mobile
telecommunications network in China's leading industrial city will
expand in late August, according to the Shanghai Long-Distance
Telecommunications Administration (SLTA).
</P>
<P>
The municipality's analogue network now has a capacity for
240,000 subscribers, but 220,000 local users have already
saturated the market, in addition to roaming users from outside
the city. The latter occupy some 10 percent of the city's total
network capacity.
</P>
<P>
SLTA officials said that the network projected capacity after
expansion will serve an additional 140,000 users, bringing the
total to about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom's Global Digital Communication will also enlarge
its network capacity to serve up to 400,000 users by the first
half of 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A charity organization run
by a neighborhood committee in Guangzhou has assisted 34 elderly
people and 10 poor families since it set up last month.
</P>
<P>
The organization has received donations worth 150,000 yuan
from residents in the community since it was set up by the
Wenchang Neighborhood Committee on July 8 in the capital of
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Among the donors are pensioners, government officials, pupils
and business people from Taiwan region.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the neighborhood committee shows that
before the charity organization was established, the community
had 18 residents, including orphans, widows and the aged, who
depended on the government's monthly relief of 220 yuan per person.
</P>
<P>
The financial assistance is barely enough to maintain a minimum
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that the community, with a population
of 34,000, had some 250 poor families whose members are mostly
retired factory workers.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hui, director of the neighborhood committee, is
responsible for setting up the group to aid the needy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Daqing oilfield in north
China maintained a 50-million-ton annual crude output for a record
20 years (1976-1995) and is expected to keep it for another 10
years or more.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield is China's largest oil production base, with 5.26
billion tons of proven oil reserves. A total of 1.35 billion tons
of crude oil output had been produced by the end of 1995,
accounting for 47.2 percent of China's total for the period.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the introduction of state-of-the-art technology, such
as "stablizing oil by controlling water", Daqing has the longest
record of stable yield for similar oilfields anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Located in western part of Heilongjiang province, Daqing is 138
kilometers long and 73 kilometers wide, covering an area of 5,470
square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Syria Expects Israel's Strike in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel was working to
"concretize" a military operation in south Lebanon in order to
"obscure" the radical policy of the rightist government, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the London-based Hayat daily, senior Syrian
sources linked a "Lebanon First" proposal put forward by the
Israeli leaders to the intention on an aggression against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the announcement of the so-called "Lebanon
First" proposal was accompanied by "an escalation of threatening
tongue suggesting the aggression."
</P>
<P>
Under the "Lebanon First" proposal, the Jewish state says it
will agree to a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon if
the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas are disarmed and
the security of northern Israel guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian sources expected "an increasingly escalation of
Israel's threatening tongue until concretizing an aggressive
operation" in a bid to live up to the program that led Benjamin
Netanyahu to a victory in the May 29 general election.
</P>
<P>
They added that the aggression would also be aimed to "disturb
the democratic atmospheres which accompany the (current)
parliamentary elections in Lebanon and which express the strong
national unity of the Lebanese people."
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed to Israel's threat of military operations
in Lebanon and its report on Syria's efforts to manufacture
Scud-C Missiles, a kind of long-range missiles capable of hitting
targets all over Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This is the Israeli strategy aimed to torpedo and blow up the
peace process," they said.
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer a secret that Israel and (other) enemies of
Lebanon have expressed their dissatisfaction with the Lebanese
elections and the signals which the elections sent out," the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
"So Netanyahu hastily visited the south Lebanon's occupied
area and issued more threats under the strategy of destroying the
peace process," the Syrian sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu visited Israel's 15-kilometer-wider buffer zone in
south Lebanon Monday, warning that the Jewish state could
not "stand still" if Hezbollah guerrillas launch more attacks at
the Israeli forces and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia.
</P>
<P>
The Hayat daily asserted that the Syria's expectations on the
Israeli aggression coincided with rumors in some world capitals
over a possible escalation of tension between Israel and Syria in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But it also noted that a well-informed French source ruled out
the possibility that Netanyahu would order an military strike at
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Netanyahu resorted to the military operation,
"Israel will find itself in a position confronting the world's
willingness and being isolated by Egypt and Jordan."

<HEADLINE> Ex-Im Bank to Extend Loan to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Japan
will provide a 500 million U.S. dollar loan to Mexico for
promoting its exports, Kyodo News Service quoted the bank as
saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the loan was signed at in Mexico City with
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto in attendance on the second day of Hashimoto's
three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The Ex-Im Bank had suspended its financial assistance to Mexico
since the end of 1994 when the country was shaken by a currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The decision to resume financial assistance reflects the bank's
high regard for the Mexican government's efforts to stabilize its
economy after the currency crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
The 500 million dollar loan will be used for modernizing the
facilities of Mexican export industries, such as the automobile
and electronics sectors, the Ex-Im Bank said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Finance Minister on Macro-Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
macro-economic strategy remained the government's priority, the
local daily the Citizen today quoted Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel as saying.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the second reading debate on the budget in the
National Assembly on Wednesday, Manuel said various parts of the
strategy were well under way, and negative reports and questions
to this effect were not withstanding.
</P>
<P>
The strategy was launched by Manuel on June 14.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, contained more ambitious deficit reduction
targets, further relaxation of exchange controls and supply side
trade incentives, was the government's final say on where the
economic policy was heading.
</P>
<P>
Although projections of the outcome of the financial year at
this stage were extremely difficult, Manuel said, he was
confident of being on target for the 5.1 percent budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that macro-economic fundamentals were mainly
sound. Furthermore, the economy was still on course for growth of
more than three percent this year, and inflation would be
contained at below eight percent despite the depreciation of the
currency.
</P>
<P>
This was the longest period of growth the country had
experienced since 1945, he added. enditem

MOSCOW -- Russian security chief Alexander Lebed said early
today that there would be no bombardments on Grozny and the
ultimatum issued by the army was only a "bad joke."
</P>
<P>
Lebed made the announcement following his talks with rebel
Chechen military chief Aslan Maskhadov at the Noviye Atagi
village, south of Grozny, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya,
said the two sides had agreed to hold a new round of talks at 10
a.m. (06:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
SARAJEVO -- Bosnia's ruling party -- the Muslim Party of
Democratic Action (SDA) -- Wednesday announced that it would
boycott the country's elections on September 14 if refugees were
allowed to vote from outside the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
The SDA was expected to hold a meeting on Thursday, seeking a
suspension of the election rule which permits refugees to vote
from the places they are living in rather than their pre-war
residences.
</P>
<P>
A government radio here reported that the SDA would call on all
the parties to boycott the election if the interim election
committee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE)
did not accept its requirement.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is charged with supervising the elections under the
Dayton peace agreement, which was signed last December in the
United States ending the three-and-half year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan said here
Wednesday that under the natural gas deal signed by Turkey and
Iran, the gas pipeline would be completed within one year.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made the announcement in a press conference after
returning home earlier today from his 11-day first foreign visit
to Iran, Pakistan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said: "Turkey needs natural gas badly. The
natural gas from Russia is inadequate from what Turkey actually
needs. It is important from the point of view of the development
of Turkey's eastern and southeastern regions."
</P>
<P>
LONDON -- The European Union (EU) has said that it would appeal
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) if the United States
punished European firms with business links with Iran and Libya,
according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called D'Amato legislation, signed by U.S.
President Bill Clinton earlier this month, the American government
will penalize those foreign companies or individuals that invest
above 40 million U.S. dollars a year in the energy sectors of Iran
and Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government on behalf of the EU said in a statement,
"the EU does not believe that this legislation is an appropriate
or an effective means of combating international terrorism."

<HEADLINE> The Whole World Wants to Know China: US Librarian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- An American librarian said here
today that the launching of a world library conference in Beijing
indicates that the world is paying attention to China and wants to
understand the country better.
</P>
<P>
Robert Wedgeworth, curator of the Library of Illinois University
and president of the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutions (IFLA), told a press conference that
Beijing is an appropriate choice to host IFLA's 62nd General
Conference.
</P>
<P>
"China represents one fifth of the world's population, and is a
country that is bursting with energy, with many different kinds of
construction projects underway," he said, adding that the country
also impresses the world with its rich culture and history.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very good place to demonstrate how information can
be put into the use to help people and assist economic
development," he said, pointing out that the country has made
great advances in the education and training of its people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe this is an opportunity to see a country in the
state of rapid growth," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said he has spent much of his career collecting information
and books about China for his library.
</P>
<P>
Wedgeworth also said that the Chinese organizing committee of
the IFLA conference has done an excellent job of preparing for the
meeting, which will be attended by some 2,600 Chinese and overseas
delegates from August 25-31.
</P>
<P>
The meeting itself is an indication that China has made great
progress in developing its libraries over recent decades. But he
added that the country still has a lot of difficulties to overcome
to bring a full range of information to a population of 1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
And the international community should pay more attention to
the information gap between developed countries and the
less-developed, according to the librarian.
</P>
<P>
The IFLA is a non-governmental organization consisting of
associations, institutes and individuals from 138 countries and
regions. This is the first time it has held its annual meeting
in China.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- At present there are 120,000
Rwandan, Angolan and Burundian refugees in Zambia,
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Opening a seminar on the Refugee Law here on Wednesday, Zambian
Permanent Secretary Eve Jahla of the Ministry of Legal Affairs said
receiving refugees is not an easy task because of obligations and
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
She said "looking after refugees in (is) a huge task,
internationally and domestically because the host country has to
provide basic needs."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Representative to Zambia of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees Benedict Akinola said the number of
refugees in the sub-region is declining due to the voluntary
repatriation and the political stability in South Africa but
there is no room for celebration because anything can happen.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Herdsmen Have New Concepts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- "You have to butcher cows and
sheep when you have too many of them, this will help you live a
better life, " said Dungzhu, a 34-year-old Tibetan man.
</P>
<P>
According to Tibet's old concepts, Dungzhu's remark would be
unacceptable to the old generation of Tibet's herdsmen who were
always reluctant to kill their own cows and sheep which they
regarded as the symbol of their property.
</P>
<P>
Instead of butchering domestic animals, Tibetan herdsmen used
to buy meat from others, owing to the influences of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
However, things are different now.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, I routinely butcher a dozen sheep in the
autumn, which not only meets the daily needs of my family, but
also, through the selling of fleece and sheepskin, helps me earn
thousands of yuan."
</P>
<P>
However, Tibet's pasture could not afford too many sheeps owing
to its peculiar geographical environment. During harsh winter
months large quantities of animals died because of lack of enough
grass, and the situation became worse if the pasture was hit by
natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Priority should be given to the change of herdsmen's concepts
if we want to see Tibet's livestock farming improve," said
Gongshang, a local Tibetan official.

</P>
<P>
It is also a rare historical opportunity for the future
development of Shenzhen, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, the country's leading special economic zone
neighboring Hong Kong, has set an ambitious plan for its second
round of development to turn itself into an international
metropolis in the next 15 years, according to the mayor.

structure, aiming to make the tertiary sector and the hi-tech
sector the biggest industries, accounting for 55 percent and 35
percent of the total industrial production respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city will also work to link its economy with that of Hong
Kong to help maintain Hong Kong's present status, the mayor said,
noting that Hong Kong is an international financial, trade and
transportation center, and the two are mutually complementary
economically.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen will exert greater efforts in improving urban

hi-tech sectors will be put atop the agenda to improve the quality
of local residents, and introduce people with needed skills from
other parts of the country, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, the city government will attach greater
importance to environmental protection and public security as well
as moral education among its citizens to turn Shenzhen into
a moral society.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shenzhen will step up its battle against pornography,
gambling and drugs, the mayor said. He added the future of
Shenzhen relies on the implementation of its various strategies.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The provincial government of
Jiangxi in East China has called on local people to accelerate the
implementation of its strategic program to release people in
mountainous areas from poverty through afforestation.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched in 1995, is designed to make use of the
vast mountainous and hilly lands, which cover 63 percent of the
province's total area and are the weak point of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the program, the province will increase its forest
acreage to 9.33 million hectares, with wood reserves standing at
280 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
The program will also help improve the local environment and
enrich the lives of residents in mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the output value in the mountainous areas is expected
to catch up with that in the province's grain lands, while by
2005, it will be equal to that in all the cultivated lands in
province's plain regions.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang to Improve Foreign Investment Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province has said it will handle foreign
businessmen's complaints better to improve the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jianxiang, deputy mayor of the city, made the remarks at a
recent meeting, where he pointed out that the city government is
open to criticism from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, there have been 3,701 joint ventures set up in the
city, with a total investment of 7.34 billion yuan (about 880
million US dollars). Of them 1,683 are now in production. Last
year, they contributed one-tenth of the city's industrial output
value and 20 percent of its export volume.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, some local authorities have made
approval procedures more complex and collected illicit fees from
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Shenyang Foreign Trade and Economic
Committee says that from now on, authorities cannot collect
illicit fees from overseas-funded companies, accept gifts, or try
to blackmail them, and the amount of time needed to approve a
project cannot exceed five working days.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the city's construction committee and economic
and trade committee say that their working systems will be made
more open to safeguard the interests of foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Urged to Be Prepared for Typhoon Nikki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese people and army are
urged to be prepared for a new typhoon and the ensuing floods that
are threatening the capital city and the northern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological officials said that the storm "Nikki", the 13th
so far this year in the South China Sea and the fourth to threaten
Vietnam, is moving north-west towards northern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The storm is likely to affect the coastal areas as badly as the
storm "Frakie" did three weeks ago, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers warned that the storm could bring more heavy rains,
worsening the floods already in the northern part.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Hanoi, people have been working around
the clock to combat the flooding of the Red River over the past
two days.
</P>
<P>
The river's water level peaked at 12.40 meters on Wednesday,
inundating the suburban districts on its left bank and many
villages on its right.
</P>
<P>
Despite floods in some northern provinces, rice prices remain
stable on the Hanoi market. But beef and vegetables are 10 to 20
percent more expensive.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said some 80,000 people in the Vinh Phu
Province were rendered homeless Wednesday morning as part of the
Red River embankment burst 50 kilometers north of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Ten of thousands of train and bus passengers were trapped in
flooding waters in the province.
</P>
<P>
The reports said people in the mountainous provinces of Lai
Chau, Lao Cai, Yen Bai and Son La remain on high alert, as
continuous rains are causing landslides. Grade 3 flood warnings
are still effective in these provinces, meaning rivers are likely
to burst their banks.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Speeding up Urban Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction of dilapidated
houses in urban area is accelerating in Shanghai, and 500
factories, one-third of the city's total, will be moved from the
urban centers to the suburbs or other neighboring provinces or
cities.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, since 1993, 210,000 residents moved
and 8.6 million square meters of houses have been pulled down,
1.75 and 2.15 times the total in the past twelve years,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
"This would have been completed in 100 years according to an
original plan," local officials said.
</P>
<P>
A governmental preferential policy has attracted overseas
businessmen to invest in real estate in this leading industrial
and financial city of China. Among 15,000 approved overseas-funded
projects with a total contractual investment of 16 billion US
dollars, 10 percent are in real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction is a result of Shanghai's plan to evacuate
industrial enterprises from the urban centers to suburban areas or
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Also, the construction of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai,
which occupies 520 square kilometers, has allowed 40 percent of
the residents in the urban areas moved to Pudong.
</P>
<P>
While speeding up rebuilding of the old residential areas,
Shanghai has maintained the traditional styles of buildings with a
combined floor space of nine million square meters.

<HEADLINE> No Russian Bombardments on Grozny Expected: Lebed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian security chief Alexander
Lebed said early today that there would be no bombardments on
Grozny and the ultimatum issued by the army was only a "bad joke."
</P>
<P>
Lebed made the announcement following his talks with rebel
Chechen military chief Aslan Maskhadov at the Noviye Atagi
village, south of Grozny, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya,
said the two sides had agreed to hold a new round of talks at 10
a.m. (06:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"Both sides hope to sign an agreement today," he added, but
declined to give more details.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached an agreement at least on one issue -- that
is: no longer to use the language of ultimatum," Lebed said.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov endorsed Lebed's mediation efforts, saying both sides
were seeking a solution that could be widely acceptable.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to do all we can to save face for each other,"
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that Chechnya never wants to defeat Russia in war.
</P>
<P>
Lebed arrived in Chechnya from Moscow on Wednesday night, the
third time since he became Yeltsin's special envoy to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Konstantin Pulikovsky, the acting commander of the
Russian troops in Chechnya, issued an ultimatum that Russian
troops would storm Grozny unless Chechen rebels stop assaults.

<P>
SANYA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Sanya, a city well-known as a
tourist attraction in Hainan Province, has spent 50 million yuan
(six million US dollars) to build 63 highways over the past few
years to improve its infrastructure.

1988, the year when Hainan became a province.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Sanya hosted more than two million tourists from other

TEHRAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government has
broken silence over the renewed fighting in Moslem-inhabited
Chechnya, voicing its "grave concern" over the impending Russian
Assault on Chechnya, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi said that "Iran is

<P>
He appealed for restraint, saying: "Enough is enough. There

He said: "I know the Russian government is trying its best to
avoid bloodshed in Chechnya, but due to certain circumstances
fighting has resumed."
</P>
<P>
Iran has long kept silent over the fighting in Chechnya as it

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The vice-chairman of China's
Central Military Commission expressed his hope that Japan will
present an accurate picture of the history of Japanese aggression,

countries.
</P>

General Chi Haotian, who is also a state councillor and defense
minister of China, made the remark here this morning when meeting
with Naomeki Murata, administrative vice-minister of the Japanese
Defense Agency.
</P>
<P>
Murata is visiting China for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Chi told his guest that as China is the largest developing

bilateral relations are of great significance for peace and
stability between the two countries, as well as in the
Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world.

</P>
<P>
Quoting a Chinese saying that "lessons learned from the past
can guide one in the future," Chi further expressed his hope that
Japan will be faithful to the true history of the Japanese

He also hoped that Japan could take the road of peace, so as to
develop long-term, stable good-neighborly relations between the
two countries.
</P>

both China and Japan to strengthen exchanges, and enhance mutual
trust and promote cooperation, in order to bring stable and
lasting peace into the next century.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Cooperation in Research on Turpanology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Experts and scholars from famous
universities in China and the United States are working together
to study ancient religions, historical culture, and cultural
relics in the Turpan area of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to bilateral agreement, scholars from both sides will
conduct researches on ancient religions, historical culture,
geology, traffic and ruins of cultural relics over a three-year
period.
</P>
<P>
The 26-member research group consists of scholars and experts
from Yale University and Harvard University in the United States,
and Beijing University and Wuhan University in China.
</P>
<P>
Based on their research, books of Turpan's history and culture,
and a collection of research papers on Turpan's cultural relics
and documents are expected to be published.
</P>
<P>
Many foreigners studied Turpanology at the end of the 19th
century. Later, Germany, Britain, the United States, France, Japan
and other countries established organizations to study Turpan's
cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
China set up the China Dunhuang-Turpan Society in 1983. Many
Dunhuang-Turpan materials centers have been set up in the country,
and courses on Dunhuang-Turpanology have also been offered at a
dozen Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
Turpan is home to rich and diversified cultural relics in
northwest China. A recent census of the area revealed 175 more
sites of cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Residents Each Consume 23 kg of Aquatics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The amount of aquatic products
consumed yearly by people in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region has reached 23 kilograms, more than the
country's average level.
</P>
<P>
By focusing on both fishing and breeding, fishery in the region
has witnessed a sustained and rapid development, said local
aquatics officials.
</P>
<P>
The space of ponds and reservoirs suitable for freshwater
breeding in Guangxi covers some 16,000 hectares, where more than
40 varieties of fish are raised.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the coastal region has a vast space of sea
territory, which has a number of living ocean beings. And large
tracts of beach along the Beibu Gulf can be used for the breeding
of maritime products.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the region has changed the traditional
practice of favoring fishing over breeding. It has taken advantage
of ponds and reservoirs to breed freshwater fish such as carp,
grass carp, and finless eel, and uses polder areas to breed
shrimp, conch, pearls and other marine products. Guangxi's "south
pearls" are well-known throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the aquatic breeding area in Guangxi reached 191,600
hectares, 70,000 hectares more than in 1985. That year's
production of aquatics hit a record 1.01 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The ratio between the amount of aquatic products taken from the
sea and that of the breeding products has changed from 1:0.47 to
1:0.9, which has improved the fishery development structure.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the regional government has given favorable
policies or support in finance, materials, tax, technology for the
development of fishery.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 470,000 people in the region worked in the fishing
industry, 3.13 times the number in 1985. Motorized fishing boats
reached 16,000, increasing 2.3 times. During the decade, the
output value and exports of aquatic products in Guangxi each
increased five times.

<HEADLINE> Mountaineers to Qomolangma Need Support From Yaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Mountaineers marching toward the
peak of Qomolangma, known as Mount Everest in Tibet, have special
affection for yaks. For their success in scaling the roof of the
world is closely related to the plateau animals.
</P>
<P>
Yaks are renowned as the "ships of the plateau" and they play
an outstanding role in mountain-climbing.
</P>
<P>
"Without the aid of yaks, we mountain climbers would have to
pay more," said Samzhub, head of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Mountaineering Expedition.
</P>
<P>
"Yaks have been indispensable assistants in our climbs of
Qomolangma many times," he said. The peak with an altitude of more
than 8,800 meters is the highest on earth.
</P>
<P>
The base camp for the peak is 5,200 m above sea level, 40 km
from Basum Township of Dingri County. The road ahead of the camp
is always blocked by serac, or ice pinnacles, so expeditions have
to rent yaks from native people.
</P>
<P>
Mountaineering material needs to be carried to about 6,500 m
above sea level, the highest limit for yaks.
</P>
<P>
According to Namgyai, an official at the township, logistics
for mountaineering teams is extremely important. Mountaineers must
save as much energy as possible to successfully complete their
ascents.
</P>
<P>
In turn, yaks have provided a considerable income for the local
people. Normally three yaks from three households and one herdsman
make a transport party, and one trek may bring about 1,500 yuan
(180 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Young yaks can be put into use as soon as they are three years
old, and the animal is able to live about 13 years. The mild and
cold-proof animals can carry 60 to 80 kg of load each time.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India to Revise Friendship Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India are on the
process to talk over a bilateral peace and friendship treaty
signed in 1950 with a view to revising it, Nepali Foreign Minister
Prakash Chandra Lohani said.
</P>
<P>
"Each political party (in Nepal) should state its stance on the
1950 Nepal-India treaty so as to reach a consensus before taking
it up with India," Lohani, quoted by the local press today, told
the parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While answering queries from opposition MPs, the foreign
minister said the government will put forward a national policy of
equality, cooperation and mutual benefits to better relations
with India.
</P>
<P>
The previous governments in Nepal have claimed that the 1950
peace and friendship treaty treats Nepal as subservient to India.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has been asking India for a review to the treaty, but
India had maintained that the treaty would either be retained
entirely or abolished in accordance with its clauses.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian side has recently agreed to review the
treaty on appropriate levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lohani said Wednesday that Nepal has a plan to
review the 1947 tripartite treaty signed by Britain, India and
Nepal on the Gurkha troops in the British army.
</P>
<P>
Retired Gurkha soldiers in Nepal have accused the British
government of discriminating against them by paying much less
pensions to them than to their British counterparts.
</P>
<P>
They presented a memorandum to the Nepali government about two
months ago asking it to take up their welfare demands to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Mountain Closed Off to Climbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A mountain in Indonesia's
easternmost province of Irian Jaya has been declared an off-limits
area to climbers after a series of kidnappings by rebels in the
area, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have closed off the Garstensz peak of Mount
Jayawijava (4,884 meters) in the light of the January abduction of
seven foreigners and 19 Indonesians, the Antara news agency quoted
L. A. Bolling, the head of the llage sub-district of central Irian
Jaya, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bolling did not say when the ban took effect. He said the
measure was only temporary, but could not say when climbers can
return to the mountain, a popular challenge for international
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian authorities have temporarily halted all research
programs in Irian Jaya following the end of the hostage drama in
May. The seven foreigners were on a scientific research when they
were abducted on January 8.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, an armed group of some 50 men, abducted 16
workers of the logging firm Pt. Karmundan Raya not far from the
southeastern base of the mountain, which lies in a range in
central Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The captors are still taking 12 people hostage after two
escaped and two were released to deliver a letter to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian military has mobilized at least 176 army troops
and dozens of police dogs in an attempt to rescue the 12 hostages
in the mountain area.

<HEADLINE> Tortoises On The Roof In East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- A 43-year-old farmer in east
China's Shandong province has turned the roof of his house into a
home for tortoises in an effort to earn a tidy sum.
</P>
<P>
Qianzhangzhuang, an ordinary village in southern Shandong, had
only an average of 0.04 hectares of land per capita, so local
authorities asked farmers to make full use of their courtyards to
develop economy. Taking them at their word, Qiu Lianzhong, in
1994, learned that courtyards were used by some people to raise
tortoises.
</P>
<P>
"Why not raise tortoises on the roof?" he thought, and
thereupon spent 100,000 yuan putting up an 84-sq.m. building, on
the roof of which he built a pond.
</P>
<P>
Following Qiu's successful example, farmers in Qianzhangzhuang,
Taierzhuang town, Zaozhuang city busied themselves turning their
roofs into fish ponds, expecting an attractive income.
</P>
<P>
To Qiu's pleasure, the tortoises began to lay eggs, as many as
20 at a time in some cases, on the wooden boards, and the next day
they were put into the pond.
</P>
<P>
Because of a lack of certain protective measures, however, some
eggs and baby tortoises were injured by birds and mould began to
grow on some grown tortoises.
</P>
<P>
So, Qiu collected materials on raising tortoises from various
sources and worked out his own set of scientific cultivation
methods.
</P>
<P>
At present, he gets 550 full-grown tortoises from his roof ponds
and 1,500 fish annually, worth some 60,000 yuan. Eight other
farmers in the village got wealthy by raising tortoises in the
same way, and more of them are preparing to change their roofs
into tortoise ponds.

TIANJIN, August 22 (Xinhua) -- The largest port city in north
China has been listed at the top of the country's major cities in
terms of treatment of environment from 1992 to 1994 by the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the municipal government has considered
environment protection while mapping out urban infrastructure
construction plans, and sewage and garbage treatment and
afforestation have kept pace with the basic construction.
</P>
<P>
The city now can deal with 660,000 tons of sewage on a daily
basis, putting it at the top of the list in the country, and more
than one milliion coal-burning stoves have been put out of use.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, 121 enterprises that were discharging
pollutants and more than 70 enterprises located in residential
areas have been relocated, while efforts were increased to find
replacements for products and equipment that were heavy energy
consumers and produced heavy amounts of pollution.
</P>

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Bulgaria to Shut Down Loss-Making Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government should
stop protecting loss-making state enterprises and close them down
to cut the budget deficit, an International Monetary Fund expert
said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An Makgark, who is on an IMF mission to crisis-hit Bulgaria,
said the country will only get a 1.15 billion U.S. dollar loan
from the bank if it meets the economic conditions set by the fund
in September.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria was already given a 580 million dollar loan in July by
the IMF in a bid to ease the economic crisis facing the
debt-ridden country.
</P>
<P>
The government has promised to shake-up the huge, loss-making
state-owned sector. In a reform plan presented to the IMF and the
World Bank in April, Bulgaria said 106 companies would be closed
down and some 60 others, including the Bulgarian State Railway,
the national carrier Balkan Airlines, power plants and coal mines,
put on a "stabilization program."
</P>
<P>
Five loss-making banks have also been ordered to close down and
national banks have been told to stop providing fresh loans to
many state companies in the red.
</P>
<P>
But Makgark said that although some progress has been made, the
country is still moving too slowly.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official acknowledged that closing down the big
loss-making enterprises is hard, but is the only way to transform
to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The fund is also worried about recent successive devaluation of
Bulgarian national currency the lev, which plunged 30 percent
against the dollar between mid-June and the end of July. Official
interest rates were at 108 percent in July to try to stabilize the
value of the lev.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is seeking financial support from the IMF and the
World Bank to help pull it out of its economic crisis. The country
needs to cover some 4.4 billion dollars in foreign debt payments
over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange reserves have more than halved to 700 million
dollars this year, raising concern about Bulgaria's ability to
service its debts this year.

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- More and more overseas
businesses are seeking advice from engineering consulting firms
about where and when they should invest in China, and what they
will need when they do, today's China Daily quoted industry
members as saying.
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of Chinese business people are also seeking
consultants' help, evidence that they realize engineering
consultancy is vital to scientific decision-making, minimizing
investment risk and enhancing investment efficiency, said members
of the Beijing-based China National Association of Engineering
Consultants (CNAEC) yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The CNAEC members said that China's prospects for engineering
consultancy appear bright. They said the central government has
worked out a plan to speed the development of their industry by
the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Engineering consultancy is marked out for special attention
both in the 1996-2000 plan and the plan for development targets to
the year 2010, as an important component of reform in China's
investment system.
</P>
<P>
The sources estimate there are more than 3,000 engineering
consulting firms across the country, employing more than 400,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Some 900 of these are certified with top-class status by CNAEC,
a national and non-governmental professional organization. Another
800 have applied to CNAEC for certification.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the future, CNAEC members said that they will
strengthen co-operation and exchange with their counterparts in
the Asian-Pacific region to advance their sector.

<HEADLINE> Muslim SDA Party Considers Election Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's ruling party -- the
Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA) -- Wednesday announced
that it would boycott the country's elections on September 14 if
refugees were allowed to vote from outside the Bosnian
Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
The SDA was expected to hold a meeting on Thursday, seeking a
suspension of the election rule which permits refugees to vote
from the places they are living in rather than their pre-war
residences.
</P>
<P>
A government radio here reported that the SDA would call on all
the parties to boycott the election if the interim election
committee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE)
did not accept its requirement.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE is charged with supervising the elections under the
Dayton peace agreement, which was signed last December in the
United States ending the three-and-half year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
An OSCE poll showed that all the Serb refugees living in the
"Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina" wanted to cast
ballots in their living places.
</P>
<P>
As many as 20 to 25 million ballot papers were printed for the
Bosnian elections, out of which 3.2 million ballots would sent to
55 countries for hundreds of thousands of Bosnian refugees to use
for their voting, said the OSCE.

<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Domestic enterprises burdened by
over-stocked products can find help through a computerized trading
system that can arrange barter deals with other companies across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The system can match stock-piled products with supply and
demand factors, allowing firms to lower inventories by trading
over-stocked goods to firms in locales where the items are readily
salable, today's "China Daily" quoted Xu Huazhong, a State
Economic and Trade Commission official, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that computer trading is expected to help state-owned
enterprises further tap production and marketing potentials, speed

<HEADLINE> Gas Supply to Beijing to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Oil workers in the
flood-stricken North China Oilfield are making strenuous efforts
to speed up teh resumption of normal supply of natural gas to
Beijing, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to resume the normal supply of natural gas within 10
days," said Cai Zhigang, vice-president of the North China
Oilfield Administration Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Cai said that the daily gas supply to Beijing had risen to
320,000 cubic meters yesterday, only 20,000 cubic meters short of
the normal capacity.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's Suqiao Gas Station in Hebei province, which is the
main source of supply for Beijing, has been swept by a record
flood -- the worst in 20 years -- since August 3.
</P>
<P>
As a result of two-meter-high floodwater overflowing the Daqing
River some 120 kilometers south of Beijing, the station's four gas
wells were forced to stop production, reducing the output by
150,000 cubic meters a day.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's current demand for natural gas is some 390,000 cubic
meters, which is used by about 300,000 families and 10 factories.
</P>
<P>
"We have dome out best to ensure the supply of natural gas to
Beijing and we think household use of gas should not be affected,"
said Cai, who is in charge of natural gas production.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Natural Gas Company said on August 19 that it has
cut off the gas supply for industrial use in order to satisfy
family demand for cooking gas.
</P>
<P>
Cai noted that the output of some working gas wells has been
boosted to the maximum to ensure a continued supply for Beijing's
gas users.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's 122 oil wells were also submerged by flood water,
causing direct economic losses of 1.5 million yuan per day.
</P>
<P>
The North China Oilfield now has two gas pipelines supplying
gas to Beijing -- one 68 kilometers long and another 72 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Cai pointed out that Beijing's lack of an intermediary gas
shortage depot and the city's obsolete technical facilities are
partly responsible for the sudden fall in daily gas supply during
the emergency.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai, gas reserves verified in the North China
Oilfield have reached 3.9 billion cubic meters, which can be used
for another eight years.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Survived 72 Bullet Wounds Dies in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Nicaraguan man who held a
world record for surviving seven assassination attempts which left
him with 72 bullet wounds, has died, the "El Nuevo Diario"
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Ortuno Leciaire, who died on Monday at the age of 74
in central Nicaragua, was a victim of a 19-year vendetta by
another family.
</P>
<P>
The feud began in 1951 when Ortuno Leciaire was just 17. He
was shot 11 times when he tried to break up a fight at a wedding
reception between three brothers surnamed Mairena Travers, a son
of the dead man told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, the brothers set up several assassination attempts
against him.
</P>
<P>
After surviving the 11 bullet wounds, Ortuno Leciaire was later
shot in the stomach with a 12-millimeter shotgun.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he survived several other attempts on his life.
</P>
<P>
But only once did he have a face-to-face confrontation with one
of the family, Rodolfo Mairena Travers. In a fight in a
restaurant, he was shot in the head four times.
</P>
<P>
Miraculously he survived. But the last assassination bid on
September 15, 1970, left him blind after a hired gunman shot him
in the temple with a 22 Magnum rifle.
</P>
<P>
Ortuno Leciaire, who boasted to his friends he had as many
lives as the proverbial cat, had an entry in the Guinness Book of
World Records for having survived so many bullet wounds.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Rise in January-June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fact that the number
of foreign-invested projects approved by the Chinese government
dropped by almost ten percent in the first half of this year, the
value of these investments actually jumped to 19.8 billion US
dollars, 20 percent higher than the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
These figures send a message of ripening maturity in attracting
foreign investment, and indicate a more intensive and effective
use of such funds in this country.
</P>
<P>
The direction of foreign investment has also shown signs of
change. The numbers of foreign-funded projects involving
infrastructure construction and technology-intensive projects are
mounting, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, there were 55 projects with
overseas funds over 30 million US dollars each. Projects of this
scale account for an impressive 5.32 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of this June, China had
approved more than 225,000 overseas investment projects, with
actual utilization of these funds surpassing 140 billion US
dollars. Investors from over 150 countries and regions, including
some multinational corporations, are now becoming involved in
China's economic construction.

<HEADLINE> Portugal's Traffic Accident Rate Tops Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Portugal, with a population of 10
million, has the highest traffic accident rate in Europe and the
second highest in the world, only next to South Korea, reports
here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics by the department concerned, an average
of seven people died of traffic accidents each day and 3,000 each
year from 1990 to 1995, with a total of 18,000 in the six years.
</P>
<P>
The months of June, July and August, the best time for trips
and holiday making, witness the most traffic accidents in a year.
From June to July 1996, some 8,220 traffic accidents occurred,
leaving 174 dead and 4,328 injured.
</P>
<P>
Lisbon, the capital, and Porto, the second largest city of the
country, has the most traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of the Traffic Department said poor driving skills
and driving after drinking alcohol are major reasons for the high
rate.
</P>
<P>
A joint action plan has been worked out by departments
concerned to curb the high rate. Accident-monitoring system will
be strengthened; traffic rules will be taught widely in schools;
traffic facilities and management will be improved, and more
skillful people in charge of traffic security will be trained, the
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Catches Up With Help From All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 22 (Xinhua) -- Since China's central government
called on other regions to further help the Tibet Autonomous
Region two years ago, this southwestern most part of the country
has made notable achievements in its economic development.
</P>
<P>
To lessen the economic gap between Tibet and other parts of the
country, the central government asked 14 developed provinces and
municipalities to help seven Tibetan cities build 62 projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, 149 work teams from the central
government and other provinces and cities have been sent to Tibet
to implement the projects. Nearly 3.5 billion yuan has been
allocated for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
So far 44 of the projects have been completed, while the rest
are under construction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tibetan farmers are working hard to reach the goal
set by the central government to produce enough grain and meat for
their own consumption in the autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The region has also invested 106 million yuan to help
restructure and invigorate local industries. Some local factories
have been turned into stock companies.
</P>
<P>
Now, Tibet has focused on the development of five pillar
industries including mining, forestry, building materials, animal
husbandry product processing, handcrafts and tourism.
</P>
<P>
A number of industrial projects, including gold and coal
mining, have become operational.

<HEADLINE> Japanese City Cancels Paintings Show of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The authorities of the city of
Hirakata, western Japan, has canceled an exhibition of paintings
depicting the Nanjing Massacre in the late 1930s due to pressure
from citizens and political groups, Kyodo News reported late last
night.
</P>
<P>
The city office had planned to hold a six-day exhibition of the
paintings drawn by Chinese artists in New York from August 30 at a
city gallery.
</P>
<P>
However, the city office gave in to citizens and political
groups which have been opposed to the holding of the exhibition
since August 1 when the city council made it known in its public
relations magazine, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Hirakata Mayor Hiroshi Nakatsuka and other senior officials
explained as reasons for the cancellation the possibility that
"the exhibition might affect other tenants in the building housing
the gallery," Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The news service said following the announcement of the
cancellation, a civic group which was to lend the paintings
protested to Kazuo Nakano, the city's superintendent of education.
</P>
<P>
The civic group blamed the city office for not giving
sufficient explanation for the decision, saying the exhibition
could be held at a different facility in the city in Osaka
Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Massacre, also known as "the Rape of Nanking", took
place from December 1937 through January 1938 when Japanese
Imperial Army troops invaded the eastern Chinese city and launched
a campaign of destruction and killing that left an estimated
300,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians dead and much of the city
in ruins.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, many people have yet to come to terms with and admit
the nation's aggression in Asia. Although some politicians have
broken the silence and publicly apologized, the general state
among politicians of ignoring the issue has not changed.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan President Ends Visit to Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti concluded today his three-day state visit to Chile
after signing agreements with his Chilean counterpart.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Sanguinetti and Chilean President Eduardo
Frei Luis-Tagle issued a joint declaration on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said in the declaration that the South American Common
Market (Mercosur)-Chilean agreement will constitute a decisive
step for consolidating the regional integration process and
contribute to the global growth of an atmosphere of peace and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting of the two presidents,
Sanguinetti stressed Chile's importance in the region, saying
Chile's associate Mercosur membership is very important in that
this trade bloc must be a southern one and it is not a southern
bloc without Chile.
</P>
<P>
The two governments signed an extradition treaty and three
agreements on scientific and technological exchange and
cooperation in the fishing sector.
</P>
<P>
President Sanguinetti also met Chilean Senate Leader Sergio
Diez, Chief Judge Servando Jordan and President of the Chamber of
Deputies Jaime Estevez.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chilean businessmen to invest in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
This is the first state visit paid to this country by a member
country of the Mercosur which also includes Argentina, Brazil and
Paraguay.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the
five Nordic countries today appealed for the resumption of a
cease-fire in war-torn Chechnya and urged Moscow and Chechen
separatist leaders to hold talks to find a peaceful way to solve
the 20-month conflict.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway and
Iceland, meeting in the southern Finnish city of Porvoo, also said
both sides in the Middle East peace process should proceed with
talks on the basis of the agreements that have already been signed.
</P>
<P>
However, the expansion of Jewish settlement in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip ran against the principles set out in these
agreements, the foreign ministers said.
</P>
<P>
They also called on countries involved in the process to
strengthen their aid to the Palestinian area.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction with the meeting of foreign
ministers of the three Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania on August 20.
</P>
<P>
Continuing talks and multilateral contacts between the Nordic
countries and the Baltic countries will help strengthen
cooperation, security and stability within the Baltic area, the
foreign ministers said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Has Over 3,400 Varieties of Potatoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Peru has a genetic reserve of about
3,458 varieties of potatoes which originated in the Andes.
</P>
<P>
So not surprisingly, Peru has won for the seventh successive
year the top prize at the Eighth International Potato Festival
held in Crevant, France.
</P>
<P>
It entered the contest with 105 varieties of potatoes, beating
all other big world potato growers.
</P>
<P>
Luis Benevides Pantigozo, a Peruvian agrarian expert, said the
potato was one of the most important contributions that ancient
Peruvians had offered to the European continent since the
discovery of America 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said ancient Peruvians took around 3,000 varieties of
potatoes for food and domesticated 200, which spread to other
countries in later times.
</P>
<P>
However, only 15 varieties were popular in the world. Potato
research was directed basically at increasing output, improving
quality and adaptability to climate and not to introducing new
species.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Athletes with a mental handicap
will make their first appearance in the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic
Games today, competing in two separate sports of swimming and
athletics.
</P>
<P>
In swimming, athletes with a mental handicap will compete in
the men's and women's 100 meter freestyle at the Georgia Tech
Aquatic Center, with finals starting at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
In athletics, competitors with a mental handicap will hit the
track for the first time, competing in a 200 meter race
preliminary. In addition to the 200 meter race, men and women will
compete in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
"We chose to include two events in swimming and two events in
track and field as full medal events" in the Paralympics, said
Robert Steadward, president of the International Paralympic
Committee. "This program will continue to grow and expand."
</P>
<P>
Steadward said the International Mentally Handicap Sports
Association is a founding member of the IPC and an integral part
of our movement.
</P>
<P>
"They have all of the same rights and privileges in our
movement that all of the other disability groups have -- spinal
cord injury, cerebral palsy, blind, etc. so they are a full
partner," Steadward said.
</P>
<P>
The classification for athletes with a mental handicap is T20
in track events and F20 in field events. The classification for
swimming is MH.

<HEADLINE> US Marines Arrive in Haiti to Strengthen Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- About 50 American troops from
the U.S. 2nd Marine Division today flew into the Port-au-Prince
airport, Haiti, to train a U.S. rapid-reaction unit permanently
stationed in the island, U.S. military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The training, code-named Operation Fair Winds, was a routine,
monthly reinforcement of security for some 300 American combat
engineers building roads, schools and hospitals in the
impoverished Caribbean nation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. marines' presence there was also regarded as a
strong message to opponents of Haiti's fragile democracy. Haiti
has been rocked recently by the arrest of 20 ex-soldiers accused
of plotting to attack the National Palace, armed assaults on
national police headquarters and the legislative building as well
as the assassination of two prominent rightist politicians.
</P>
<P>
"The message that I hope the Haitians would get from the U.S.
presence there...is that we want Haiti and the government in Haiti
to succeed," U.S. Defense Department spokesman Michael Doubleday
told a press briefing at the Pentagon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that government opponents in Haiti "should
realize that not only the United States but also the United
Nations and other nations in the hemisphere are watching very
closely what's going on" in the island country.

<HEADLINE> US: Israel Wants Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States confirmed
today that it had received a message from Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy that Israel was ready to begin peace negotiations with
Syria at any time without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies told a briefing
that Levy asked U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk at a meeting to send
the message to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"The (Israeli) foreign minister conveyed to Ambassador Indyk a
couple of points.... The first is that Israel is attached to the
notion of continuing the peace process without conditions, and the
second notion is that Israel would like to get back to
negotiations when it's possible to do so," said Davies.
</P>
<P>
Davies said the United States would convey the message as soon
as possible as it "has been our role in that part of the world for
some time".
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been stalled since hardline
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu assumed power in June and ruled
out surrendering the Golan Heights or swapping land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Davies said Levy's message showed his sincerity and the United
States would do what it could to "facilitate a continuance of the
Israeli-Syria peace track."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher had been planning to go
to the Middle East in September, but has put the plans on hold in
light of the lack of progress in reopening negotiations.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Cancels Most Flights for Safety Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force Combat
Command announced today that it has decided to cancel most air
operations Friday for a Safety Day review.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after recent four crashes of U.S. military
planes including U.S. President Bill Clinton's support plane.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton support plane crashed Saturday after it took off
from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the Clintons were on vocation.
All nine crew members aboard were killed and a Secret Service
communications van was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"We must step back from the day-to-day pressure of the mission
and spend a day identifying and qualifying the risks associated
with everything that we do, then devising practical ways to
mitigate those risks," the U.S. Air Forces command's chief General
Richard Hawley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The general said that units will spend the day examining every
part of their operations including the way they plan missions,
brief crews on them and fly them.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force Combat Command has a total of 980 fighter
planes, bombers and other combat planes in the United States,
Panama, Iceland and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Health Insurance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today signed a bill that would make it easier for Americans to
obtain health insurance.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the bipartisan bill will seal the "cracks" in the
country's medical system.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the measure shows what can happen "when we cross
party lines and put the interests of the American people first."
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously and the
House with only two dissenting votes, ends the practice of denying
insurance coverage on the basis of pre-existing medical
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It seals the cracks that swallow as many as 25 million
Americans who can't get insurance or fear they will lose it," said
Clinton, who made health care reform a centerpiece of his 1992
campaign and an issue early in his term. "Now, they will be
protected."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republicans said the health legislation could have
been enacted three years ago if not for the president's veto
threats.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also increases the tax deductibility of
insurance premiums for the self-employed and offers tax breaks for
premiums on long-term care and the cost of the care.
</P>
<P>
The bill does not extend equal coverage to mental illness, and
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill urged Clinton to take
the lead in pressing for parity.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Clinton
acknowledges work remains to be done on health care and mental
illness coverage is an issue "that the president believes we
should turn to again in the future."

<HEADLINE> NBC Apologizes for Remarks During Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- An official from the National
Broadcasting Company, Inc. (NBC), the leading television of the
U.S., has sent a letter of apology to the representatives of
Chinese groups who had protested against NBC's anti-China remarks
during the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Ed Markey, vice-president of NBC's sports section, who had been
communicating with the Chinese, wrote Tuesday in a brief letter,
"Mr. Costas did not intend any disrespect to the People's Republic
of China or its citizens."
</P>
<P>
"We apologize for any resulting hurt feelings," said the letter
which was addressed to Kai Chen, a chief representative of the
Chinese and Chinese American groups concerned, who sent a series
of letters of portest to NBC during the past weeks.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, the Chinese living or studying in North
America launched various kinds of protests against NBC which, they
said, made "hostile comments against many international athletes,
including Team China," during the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Bob Costas, an anchor from NBC,
commented that China has "problems with human rights, copyright
disputes, and the threat posed to Taiwan." He also said that China
has built into an athletical power, "but amid suspicions." He made
frequent reference to the "suspicions" of drug use by Chinese
athletes throughout the coverage of the Olympic Games, ignoring
the fact the American team has topped the list of such offenders
ever since the drug test was started in 1968.
</P>
<P>
His remarks ignited great indignation among the Chinese
communities across North America, said Kai Chen.
</P>
<P>
"NBC made an official apology in its letter to us Tuesday for
its remarks," Chen told Xinhua in a telephone interview today.
</P>
<P>
But Chen, the student representative from Berkeley University,
said that the statement ignored their demand for an apology from
Costas. "It is only fair to ask Mr. Costas to apologize on air
during prime evening hours and in writing," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese athletes have nothing to do with either human rights
problems or copyright disputes," Chen said in another letter to
NBC. "Biased and prejudiced comments can only stir hostilities
between the people of the two great nations: China and USA."
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Chinese organizations representing 70,000 Chinese
placed an ad of protest in the Washington Post last week.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese planned to put another ad in the New York Times
soon. Ed Markey declined to make comments on the new ad or their
negotiations with the Chinese groups.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Retreat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Stocks retreated today as
interest rates rose in the bond market and a lack of economic and
corporate news left few motivations to stimulate any major rises.
</P>
<P>
Just before the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 31.44 to 5,689.82.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-6 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 351.24
million shares, up from 334.95 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.50 to 356.11, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.47 to 665.22.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.18 to 1,126.85, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 1.61 to 557.68.
</P>
<P>
Stocks started the day lower with bonds as the yield on the
30-year Treasury rose to 6.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of any major developments, investors moved to
secure some profits from the market's recent rallies.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's biggest decliner was Philip Morris, which fell on
news that three more states are suing cigarette makers to pay for
treating smoking-related illnesses. Shares of rival cigarette
maker RJR Nabisco also slid in active NYSE trading.
