<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Starts to Build New Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka Wednesday laid the
foundation to build its second zoological garden in the central
part of the country to meet the increasing tourist demand.
</P>
<P>
The new zoo will be completed in two years under two phases at
Pinnawela, some 90 kilometers northeast of Colombo, said Senarath
Gunasena, director of the Department of National Zoological
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
"Pinnawela is likely to be one of the most picturesque zoos in
the world. The climatic conditions of the area are very congenial
to house a wide range of animals," said Gunasena.
</P>
<P>
He said another advantage of the new zoo is its proximity to
the internationally popular Elephant Orphanage at Pinnawela.
</P>
<P>
Gunasena said the zoo will be financially viable as Pinnawela
is already visited by 750,000 people annually, of whom 235,000 are
foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
Phase one of the new zoo, to be constructed on 35 acres (14
hectares) of land,will feature a Sri Lanka section and a world
zone as its main exhibition areas.
</P>
<P>
The zoo will be more spacious and animal friendly than the
current National Zoological Gardens at Dehiwela in the southern
suburb of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
More sophisticated visitor facilities including a zoo museum
will be added in phase two of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is blessed with a diverse variety of fauna and flora
due to several different climatic regions created by geographical
formation.It has been declared by international environmentalists
as a bio-diversity hot spot.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Foreign Ministers Discuss Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan and his Japanese counterpart Yohei Kono held talks
here Wednesday on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang said Sino-Japanese relations have in general maintained a
development momentum in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to build a friendly and cooperative
partnership devoted to peace and development when Chinese
President Jiang Zemin visited Japan in 1998, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries then specified the general direction and
priorities for bilateral cooperation during former Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to China last year, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
Now, the two countries are speeding up efforts to implement a
series of important political consensus reached between leaders of
the two countries, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the healthy trend, Tang said, attention must be paid
to noises frequently made by certain right-wing forces in Japan,
which disturb the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Noting that historical issues are a sensitive question of
political principles in bilateral ties, Tang urged the Japanese
side to honor its commitments made to China, sternly contain right-
wing forces, so as to prevent them from doing more harm to Sino-
Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese foreign minister also said that the Diaoyu Islands
have been part of Chinese territory from ancient times. The recent
illegal landing by Japan's right-wing group "Japan Youth
Federation" and the construction of a Shinto shrine there once
again constitute a severe political incident which hurt the
feelings of Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
China urges the Japanese side to bridle right-wing groups and
their members to prevent the reoccurrence of similar incidents,
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Kono gave a positive judgment on the development of bilateral
ties. He said today's good Japan-China relationship is the result
of unremitting efforts by the two countries' leaders of the older
generation, adding that the two countries should cherish the good
relations and push them further ahead on the basis of the Japan-
China Joint Statement in 1972 and the Japan-China Joint
Declaration in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On historical issues, Kono said Japan still maintains the view
expressed by former Japanese prime minister Tomiichi Murayama in
1995, adding that the spirit of Murayama's remarks is a concerted
view of the current Japanese cabinet and reflects the view of the
majority of the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
Kono expressed his confidence that bilateral relations will be
further improved.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the question of Taiwan, Tang said the Chinese
government will continue to stick to its basic policies of "
peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems" to seek
national reunification through dialogues and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China firmly maintains that the "one China"
principle is the basis for and prerequisite to dialogues between
the two sides across the Taiwan Straits and the peaceful
settlement of the Taiwan issue, Tang said. China's stance on this
principle has been firm and steadfast and Beijing has no room
whatsoever to make concessions on this issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang urged Tokyo to respect the spirits of the 1972 Sino-
Japanese Joint Statement and the 1998 Sino-Japanese Joint
Declaration and handle its relations with Taiwan cautiously and
properly.
</P>
<P>
Kono said Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and that the
Japanese side fully understands and respects China's stance. He
promised that Tokyo would handle relevant issues properly and
carefully on the basis of the Japan-China Joint Statement.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tang also explained China's strategy of
developing its vast west.
</P>
<P>
Kono said the Japanese side is willing to actively take part in
the drive so as to widen the scope of the two countries' economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on regional and
international issues of common concern and reached consensus on a
wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Tang arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a four-day official
visit at the invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Kono, Tang went to a Tokyo hospital to see
Obuchi, who has been in a coma after a stroke in early April.

Guangzhou, capital of South China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1972 and put into service six years later, Minsk was
retired in early 1990s and sold to a firm in the Republic of Korea
in 1995 as scrap metal. Later a Chinese company bought it for 4.68
million US dollars.
</P>

After 16 months' renovation in Guangzhou, the carrier now has
more than 30,000 sq m of space renovated for sight-seeing purposes.
The carrier as a theme park will open to the public this summer.

Kafelnikov suffered the fourth consecutive early exit this spring
after losing 6-4, 6-4 to Argentine Mariano Puerta in the second

Law Offices of E &AMP; Sasseen in California at a forum here today.
</P>
<P>
Two shining stars among them are GRIC Communications Inc., and
a software development company Viado, both of which have been
listed at Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hong, GRIC president and CEO, said at the Overseas Chinese
Scholars High-tech Industry Forum that the increase of Chinese
enterprises in Silicon Valley has made the Americans realize that
Chinese can also be good managers as well as good chefs and
engineers.
</P>
<P>
Other Chinese students who made a name in Silicon Valley
included Liu Huaizhu, founder of the Newnex Technology Corp., and
Robin Li, founder of the Baidu.com, Inc.
</P>
<P>
Chinese students are not willing to merely work as employees
with US companies and get paid handsome salaries. They want to
have their own firms.
</P>
<P>
"The successful enterprises will set a model for those who want
to have a try in the US, " Chen told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Since China initiated opening-up policies in 1978, hundreds of
thousands of students from the Chinese mainland have gone to the
United States to study.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who holds a doctorate degree in computer science at the
State University of New York, is a well-known expert in
communications and networking. The market value of his company has
exceeded one billion US dollars after six years of development.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that more Chinese students will launch enterprises
in the valley, as financial support will be given by successful
Chinese firms.
</P>
<P>
Some experienced setbacks due to lack of knowledge about
contracts and other factors. A lawyer suggested that those who
wanted to start an enterprise in Silicon Valley consult with
lawyers, accountants and other professionals.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Final-Status Talks Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators resumed their final-status talks Thursday afternoon
despite dim prospects for the two sides to reach a framework
agreement on final-status issues on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo headed their respective teams to the
talks, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The talks were kept away from the press and its location has not
been announced.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks cover the thorniest issues of the fate of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders and
water.
</P>
<P>
After holding two rounds of intensive talks with the U.S.
involvement in the United States, the two sides moved their talks
to Israel at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
The two negotiating teams, with the mediation of the U.S.
special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, could not bridge the
differences on all the key issues discussed in the talks so far.
</P>
<P>
To try to push the talks forward, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met Sunday night in
the West Bank city of Ramallah, but no progress was announced.
</P>
<P>
Arafat went to Cairo Wednesday to update Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak about the current talks.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian officials, the two sides have mainly
focused their attention on discussing the "land proposals" prepared
by Israel in the talks, but no agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Under the land proposal, the Palestinians will have to control a
total of 66 percent of the territories in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Barak has promised to let the
Palestinians control at least 80 percent of the territories in the
final peace deal, while the remaining 20 percent will be occupied
by Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Maariv reported Thursday that the Israeli government
is ready to transfer 66 percent of land to the Palestinians and the
remaining 14 percent will be handed over to the Palestinians after
a try period of several years.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator on interim issues Saeb Erekat told
the Israel Radio Thursday that all those proposals are unacceptable
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also said it is impossible for the two sides to reach a
framework agreement by Sunday as agreed by the two sides, adding
that the Palestinian side can not change the September dateline for
reaching the final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memo, the two sides had to reach the
framework agreement by February. Barak and Arafat agreed to change
the dateline till Sunday due to the slow progress made in the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to return to the region next Monday to mediate
the talks.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's High Court of Justice ruled Thursday
morning that a controversial Jewish murderer, who was sentenced to
life imprisonment after slaying a Palestinian, should not be
granted early release after serving only seven years.
</P>
<P>
The initial order of early release was issued by the Prison
Parole Board in March on account of the criminal's alleged "
contrition and his good behavior in prison," which angered the
Palestinians and prompted liberal Israeli Knesset (parliament)
member Zahava Galon to file an appeal against the planned release.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, all seven members of the High Court panel
voted to uphold the petition from Galon and overturned the parole
board's decision to set the murderer free, sources in the court
said.(Israel-Court-Murderer)

Yilmaz, who had been prime minister from June 1997 to November

when his ANAP allied with the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and the
Nationalist Action Party (MHP) to establish the coalition
government, led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.

At that time, Yilmaz preferred to stay aside, waiting for the

<HEADLINE> Romanian PM Aims at Bigger Domestic Consumption in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Romanian domestic consumption
will regain ground and register no further backdrops by the end of
the year 2000, in spite of a plunge in the first quarter, Prime
Minister Mugur Isarescu was cited on Thursday by the national
Adevarul daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu said the government is making efforts to boost
domestic consumption after several straight years of decline in
real salaries. He cited, in the context, the negotiations held
with the International Monetary Fund(IMF) over this issue. He said
that originally, the international lender had called for financial
austerity and a cut of 1-2 percent in consumption. However, the
unexpected rise in export trade figures in the first quarter of
this year sustained Romania's demands for a ceiling figure of the
2000 year consumption.
</P>
<P>
Expectations are high for a further export growth this year, up
to 10-11 billion U.S. dollars, and efforts are being made to
stimulate consumption in order to create market niches for the
Romanian products, according to Isarescu.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu ascribed IMF wariness about the prospect of a bigger
consumption to the fact that Romania had in the past achieved a
huge export record by selling yields of state-subsidised energy-
intensive enterprises, which actually belied export of energy, not
of labour. This was an unhealthy, pauperizing economic swell,
Isarescu said.
</P>
<P>
In reference to the structure of present export trade, where
the light industry holds the lead, Isarescu said that Romania must
export labour, rather than energy.
</P>
<P>
By stimulating the domestic consumption, Romania can avoid the
"historical trap" in 80's, when the country used to borrow money
for ten years and return it in two, said Isarescu, adding that by
further tightening the belt this seriousness in servicing its
foreign debt, would only be tantamount to paying in advance as in
the old times, he said.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Military Ship Fires At Turkish Fishing Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian military ship of the
Constanta Coast Guard on Thursday noon fired at a Turkish vessel
which was illegally fishing plaice in the Romanian waters.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Rompres news agency, four military
ships patrolled along the Romanian coast line on Thursday and
Constanta 39 met the fishing vessel Farhat Reis which flew no flag
and which was noticed the third time in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The commander of the Romanian military ship warned the Turkish
fishing vessel by means of radio, optical and sound signals, but
the vessel did not stop.
</P>
<P>
Boat 39 fired six times in warning but the Turkish vessel
ignored the warning. The commander of the boat ordered through the
radio the Turkish crew to leave the stern of the fishing vessel.
Then,boat 39 fired over 100 war bullets.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish vessel Farhat Reis continued its way and flew the
Turkish flag. After the attack, the commander of the fishing
vessel said in English, Turkish and Romanian that he did not know
he entered the Romanian waters.
</P>
<P>
Being damaged, the fishing vessel entered the Bulgarian waters.
</P>
<P>
The fishing of plaice, sturgeon and dolphin is forbidden in the
Black Sea over May 2 - June 30.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Determined to Carry out Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra Leone, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here Thursday that the United Nations is determined to
carry out the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, or it will
have a very serious impact on the world efforts to seek peace in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival at the U.N.
Headquarters in New York, Annan said, "I don't think there was
ever a question of withdrawal. I think we have a mandate and we
are determined to carry it out."
</P>
<P>
"I think we should also look at the broader implications," he
said. "If the international community were to fail the Sierra
Leoneans and were to fail in Sierra Leone the impact on broader
efforts by the international community on the African continent
will be very serious, and not only there but in other areas."
</P>
<P>
"I think given some of the lessons we have learned, we should
try and see this one through," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement as the international community is
fearing that failure in Sierra Leone would have ripple effect on
the U.N. efforts to bring 5,500-strong peacekeeping forces into
the Democratic Republic of Congo, where six African countries have
been involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone last
month to replace a Nigerian-led West African intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, that helped disarm the rebels as part of a peace
accord that ended an eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission quickly began to unravel after the rebels
took hostage about 500 U.N. personnel in Sierra Leone.

about bilateral relations, the environment, and social and health
themes, as a continuation of the first round of talks held in
November last year in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shipping Company to Start New Naval Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Captain Cai Mijiang, the Asian multinational company general
manager, told Xinhua Thursday that the new line, that will reach
from the Far East to U.S. east coast, will have nine container-
bearing ships.
</P>
<P>
The nine ships that will operate in the new line include seven
from Cosco, one of the Yaming firm of Taiwan, and one from the
Kline Japanese firm, Cai told Xinhua in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Cai said that the opening of the new route will produce more
than 10 million dollars in tolls to the interoceanic waterway,
that has been administered by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP)
since December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ACP will obtain more than two million dollars from the
Chinese conglomerate from the sale of fuels to its ships, all of
them under Panamanian registry and of the "Panamax" class, the
biggest that traverse the waterway.
</P>
<P>
According to Cai the opening ceremony will be held at the
Miraflores floodgates, the part of the canal closer to the Pacific
Ocean, with the attendance of Cosco America vice president Song
Qiming, and Panamanian vice president, Arturo Vallarino, among
others.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial tour includes Shanghai, China, where it was held
April 24, and precedes the one of New York, United States,
foreseen for May 24, said Cai.
</P>
<P>
The Cosco shipping company, which has 600 ships of assorted
types, is the bigger user of the Panama Canal among the shipping
companies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese conglomerate, whose operations cover almost all the
world, has six branches in Latin America: Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay, Peru, Chile and Panama, where it started to extend its
commercial ties since the decade of the seventies of the 20th
century.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says British Troops in S.Leone "Non Combatants" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
told his cabinet Thursday that British troops in Sierra Leone are
there for evacuation and not combat.
</P>
<P>
His remark was made as British media and the opposition party
charged that troops sent there to evacuate British citizens could
be drawn directly into the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Blair told a meeting of his cabinet that their role had not
changed, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister emphasized that we do have extra
responsibilities as a former colonial power, it would be wrong not
to be there, but emphasized the troops are there for evacuation,
not for combat," Alastair Campbell told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that is the limit of the troops' mission.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 British troops now around Freetown, the
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that they have evacuated some 300 people this
week but no evacuations have taken place in the last two days,
fueling speculation they could take up other tasks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook Thursday warned the
rebels in Sierra Leone not to misinterpret Britain's insistence
that its forces were not in Sierra Leone for combat.
</P>
<P>
"If our troops are attacked, they will fight back," Cook told a
news conference, adding they would "hit back, and hit back hard."

<HEADLINE> More Troops to Fly into Sierra Leone to Bolster U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
reinforcing its peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone, with two
Jordanian parachute companies comprising 240 soldiers and a 31-
member medical unit expected to fly to Freetown's Lungi airport
within 48 hours, a U.N. spokesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
U.N. reconnaissance flights "do not show the RUF (the rebel
Revolutionary United Front) in an organized position ready to
pounce on Freetown," the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean Government and U.N. troops had been
involved in skirmishes with the rebels but the "tension in
Freetown has reduced somewhat and of course in the meantime we get
stronger every day," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, the United Nations peacekeeping force announced
Thursday that two U.N. military personnel held by the RUF rebels
in eastern Sierra Leone had been released.
</P>
<P>
"Major Suresh Karki, a Nepalese Military Observer serving with
the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL), arrived
Thursday at the U.N. Mission headquarters in Freetown after being
released Wednesday in the eastern part of the country by members
of the Revolutionary United Front," said a UNAMSIL statement.
</P>
<P>
"Major Karki, who has been suffering from malaria, was
released by the RUF in order to receive medical treatment," the
statement said. "Lance Corporal Paucho Singh Chouan, a member of
the Indian contingent, was also released, unconditionally."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
here that the United Nations is determined to carry out the
peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, or it will have a very
serious impact on the world efforts to seek peace in Africa.
</P>
<P>

Headquarters in New York, Annan said, "I don't think there was
ever a question of withdrawal. I think we have a mandate and we
are determined to carry it out."
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement as the international community is
fearing that failure in Sierra Leone would have ripple effect on
the U.N. efforts to bring 5,500-strong peacekeeping forces into
the Democratic Republic of Congo, where six African countries have
been involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 U.N. peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone last
month to replace a Nigerian-led West African intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, that helped disarm the rebels as part of a peace
accord that ended an eight-year civil war.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Job Creation Project in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars to help Colombia create new
jobs and thereby mitigate the impact of the economic crisis on the
country's poorest families.
</P>
<P>
The Community Works and Employment Project is expected to crate
some 90,000 full-year jobs providing six hours of work per day,
which could indirectly benefit some 171,000 persons by improving
basic public services and providing opportunities to promote
economic recovery, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The three-year program will focus in particular on carrying out
small-scale public works such as minor construction, repairs and
expansion of schools, clinics, health facilities, roads and
bridges, and community centers, as well as pilot housing projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reducing unemployment, the project also will
have major benefits for the neediest communities by improving the
infrastructure of basic services, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will be based on a participatory and decentralized
approach, with the federal government, local authorities, non-
governmental organizations, and community organizations
participating in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Community Works and Employment Project is part of the
Colombian government's strategy to mitigate the impact of the
economic crisis and fiscal adjustment measures on the poorest
population through the social safety net system, which includes
creating temporary employment, a program to assist families in the
greatest need, and vocational training.

<HEADLINE> Six Kenyan Peacekeepers Wounded by Friendly Troops in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, Mary 11 (Xinhua) -- Six Kenyan peacekeepers in Sierra
Leone was shot and wounded on Thursday by pro-government troops
when they were mistaken for disguised rebels, reports reaching
here from Freetown said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers had been trapped for one week, before the attack,
near the town of Makeni about 240 kilometers east of the country's
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
They were one of the many groups of the United Nations peace
keeping forces, who had been dispatched to the remote areas of the
country, to demilitarize the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook warned in London that the about 1,000 strong British troops
currently stationed in Sierra Leone would "hit back hard" if they
were attacked.
</P>
<P>
The British government had repeatedly pledged that the aims of
the troop was only limited to the evacuation of foreign nationals
in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
But the British soldiers were seen active in manning roadblocks
at key junctions in the outskirts of the city with the UN
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping force has been busy, in recent days, with
 strengthening its positions around Freetown to get prepared for
possible attacks by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. forces also quickened their steps to ship more
reinforcement to the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,700 soldiers from India and Bangladesh to Freetown were
coming on Friday, said the U.N. sources in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia have said they will help with
transport and fly in supplies and some extra Jordanian troops,
possibly by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcements are part of an effort to bring the intended
11,000- strong U.N. force up to full strength. Currently there are
about 8,700 UN troops in Sierra Leone.

The indictment called for capital punishment for three
defendants, 22-year imprisonment for 24 defendants, seven-year
imprisonment for four defendants, and three-year imprisonment for

</P>
<P>
The 66-page indictment, which was prepared by the Republican

The indictment said that the Hezbollah terrorist organization
was set up by Huseyin Velioglu and some others in Batman, southeast
Turkey, in 1979 after being inspired by Moslem Brothers
Organization.

the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist organization
and that Hezbollah terrorists killed many PKK terrorists.

said that he was a civil servant for 16 years, rejecting the
accusations against him, reported the Anatolia News Agency.

<P>
Yildiz said he was taken into custody on January 21, this year
while he was working.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that he was tortured in a security department, Yildiz
declared that he turned down his previous testimony as it was given
under pressure in security department, prosecutor's office and
alternate judgeship.
</P>
<P>
Yildiz said that he was not a member of the terrorist Hezbollah
organization and called for his release.

<HEADLINE> Millennium Forum Draft Declaration Offers Bold "Global Vision of Inclusion" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11(Xinhua) -- Organizers of the Millennium
Forum on Thursday released a draft "Millennium Forum Declaration",
an overview of document which will be among the main topics of
discussion when the Forum convenes at the United Nations on May 22-
26, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Based on input that has been received so far from Forum
participants and on the documents and declarations that have been
produced at other recent civil society conferences preceding the
Millennium Forum, the draft Declaration seeks to present a bold "
global vision of inclusion" for the people of the world in the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
"The vision we wish to put forward is, in its essence, quite
simple," states the draft.
</P>
<P>
"All of us, the inhabitants of earth, are one human family,
living together interdependently on one common homeland, with the
collective goal of establishing a just, peaceful, and sustainable
world civilization marked by democracy, equality and full
participation for all persons, male and female, young and old,
regardless of race, religion, ethnicity or nationality," it said.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on "the United Nations for the 21st Century," the
Declaration also puts forward a series of concrete steps, to be
taken respectively by governments, the United Nations and its
agencies, and global civil society, to help bring about the
realization of this vision.
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Declaration calls for:
</P>
<P>
-- Reforms designed to strengthen and democratize the United
Nations by expanding the Security Council and gradually
eliminating the veto power; making the General Assembly more
representative; and establishing a United Nations International
Peace Force capable of rapid reaction in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- Governments to live up to the promises and pledges made at
the global conferences of the 1990s, when action plans on
sustainable development, human rights, population, social
development, women, shelter, and food were adopted by consensus.
</P>
<P>
-- The convening of a new "Bretton Woods" Conference to discuss
a new financial architecture for a rapidly globalizing world that
has moved beyond the Cold War and its confinements.
</P>
<P>
-- Adoption of an Earth Charter as a primary international
document. Governments should begin with the final draft of The
Earth Charter, produced over the last eight years in a series of
consultations with more than 100,000 individuals and
representatives of civil society in more than 50 countries, by the
Earth Council.
</P>
<P>
-- Institution of the highest possible standards of
transparency and democracy in all regulatory, administrative, and
information-gathering meetings for the United Nations and all of
its bodies, as well as other international agencies, including the
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled for May 22-26 at the United Nations Headquarters as
part of the preparations for the U.N.'s Millennium Assembly in
September, the Millennium Forum is expected to bring together more
than 1,000 participants from nongovernmental organizations and
other civil society groups from around the world to discuss now
the United Nations can better confront the challenges of the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan on Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TORONTO, May 11(Xinhua)-- Visiting Chairman of the National
Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li
Ruihuan said here Thursday that under the new situation, China has
paid more attention to supporting reforms and coordinated
development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark in a speech delivered a luncheon hosted by
Canada-China Business Council.
</P>
<P>
As China's reform has entered a bullet-biting stage, more
attention should be paid to supporting reforms, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"In the early stage of reform, we started with those simple
problems that are easier to be tackled. The initial reforms helped
to emancipate the productive forces from heavy shackles, which
produced quick results and benefited a great many people," he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the reform is in the most difficult stage, we are
confronted with many more deep-rooted and more complicated issues
which call for not only a thorough reform of the old system and
the gradual improvement of the new system, but also the
readjustment of interests distribution among all sectors," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
This has become an increasingly formidable job, the Chairman
stressed, adding that any major reforms must be supported by
supplementary measures.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that before introducing any reform measure, an
overall plan should be made taking into account the sequence of
steps to be taken and its effect on related areas so that reform
can be carried out in a well-coordinated manner.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, careful consideration should be given to
make sure that it will benefit the people as a whole and is within
the scope of their sustainability, so as to minimize any possible
impact and achieve its expected results," Li warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, May 11 (Xinhua)-- Visiting Chairman of the National
Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li
Ruihuan said here Thursday that as China is in a critical stage of
development, it is all the more necessary to pay attention to
coordinated development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a luncheon hosted by Canada-China
Business Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman recalled that over 20 years ago, China had a
shortage economy, with a lot of commodities in short supply and
the people had a difficult life.
</P>
<P>
"Then China introduced the reform and opening-up program and
concentrated its efforts on economic development." Li said."
Consequently, our economy developed by leaps and bounds."
</P>
<P>
However, Li said that nowadays many of the old problems of
uneven development have been eased or addressed, but some have
become more striking and some new ones have emerged.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman noted that harmony and coordination become most
important in seeking a sustained and fast growth, just like a car
running at a high speed which is more liable to accidents if some
parts are missing.
</P>
<P>
"Coordinated development means a proportionate growth and
balanced progress," said Li, adding that China must adopt an all-
round approach and pay attention to interrelations.
</P>
<P>
"We must always give consideration to overall, fundamental and
long-term interests, instead of partial and immediate interests.
We must properly handle various relations, including those between
various sectors of the economy, between economic growth and social
progress, between population, resources and environment, " Li
urged.
</P>
<P>
"In short, we should seek a fast, sustained and sound economic
growth in a coordinated manner," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Applicants Urged to Publicize EU Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The east and central European
countries applying for European Union membership are requested to
inform their citizens about their move and the consequence.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, requested the applicant countries to improve public
knowledge and understanding of the union, to explain the
implications of accession into the union, and to explain the link
between the pace of preparations for membership and the progress
of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The request was put forward in a communication strategy made
public here on Thursday by the commission.
</P>
<P>
"The accession to the European Union of the central and eastern
European countries gives rise to expectations as well as fears,"
said EU education commissioner Viviane Reding. "The information
and communication campaign launched by the commission aims to
inform the European citizen, in an objective and reasoned way, of
the stakes and the challenges of enlargement."
</P>
<P>
The commission also urged EU member states to communicate the
reasons for enlargement to their citizens as well, to promote
dialogue at all levels of society between policy-makers and the
public on issues related to enlargement and to provide information
about the candidate countries to promote general understanding.
</P>
<P>
The enlargement awareness campaign will run from 2000 to 2006
with a budget of nearly 150 million euro (139 million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
EU enlargement commissioner Gunter Verheugen said on Thursday
that the year 2005 is the latest to see the enlargement process
complete. He added that 10 of the 12 applicant countries are
preparing for that date while two others are preparing for later
dates, though he would not be specific on the dates the applicant
countries would be admitted into the union.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of Rwanda, Uganda to Meet Over Clashes in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame and
his Ugandan counterpart Yoweri Museveni are to meet on Sunday to
solve the recent clashes between the two forces in Kisangani in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and other regional
matters of concern.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda News Agency Thursday quoted Theogene Rudasingwa,
director of cabinet affairs in the President's office, as saying
that "the Rwandan and Ugandan heads of states are expected to meet
in the north western Tanzanian town of Mwanza, in the presence of
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa."
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda had been close allies in the DRC civil
conflict, but tension between the two countries surfaced last year
when they started backing different rival rebel factions in the
DRC and such relationship intensified when their forces went into
clashes in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the two leaders have met several times to resolve
their differences in the DRC but without any concrete solution. An
air of mistrust has been brewing between the two countries,
leading to amassing of troops along the Rwanda-Uganda frontier by
the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two heads of state come following a
meeting held on Wednesday in Kigali by the two countries' army
chiefs of staff over the Kisangani crisis and modalities of
avoiding further clashes in the area.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Fuel Stocks Severely Depleted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Oil Industry of Zimbabwe
Thursday said that the country's fuel stocks had been severely
depleted.
</P>
<P>
According to industry spokesman Tom Walters, although the
import rate had improved and Zimbabwe had a supply continuity for
the past four weeks, the supply chain had limitations and it would
take time to restock.
</P>
<P>
"While the restocking process goes forward, there will continue
to be imminent stock outs at service stations and elsewhere," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the oil industry was working with limited stocks and
was dependent on the daily supply from the National Oil Company of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
During the last five months, Walters said, the oil sector had
worked closely with representative industry associations to ensure
equitable distribution of limited fuel.
</P>
<P>
This was done to ensure that strategic industries were able to
continue operating, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Fuel queues have started again in some parts of Harare as
filling stations are reporting dwindling supplies.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the country's fuel supplies come through
Mozambique' s Port of Beira, but the Cyclone Eline in February
made it impossible for oil tankers to off-load fuel into the
300-kilometer pipeline to the eastern border town of Mutare,
highlighting the fuel problems.
</P>
<P>
However, petrol, diesel and paraffin shortages eased in March
after the signing of a deal between the Zimbabwean government and
Kuwait's International Petroleum Group to supply fuel for a year.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Receive Food Donation From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government will
receive a donation of food worth over 3 million Namibian dollars
(about 500,000 U.S. dollars) from the United States next week, the
Namibian Press Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the U.S. embassy in Windhoek, capital of
Namibia, said that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for
Population, Refugees and Migration Julia Taft will visit the Osire
refugee camp in Namibia next Monday and handed over nearly 800
tons of food, including grain, corn, soya blend, beans and
vegetable oil to the refugees there.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contribution will make up 96 percent of the appeal
from the World Food Program for the Osire refugee camp, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the food will be brought in from
Angola instead of being shipped from the United Sates because the
food crisis at the refugee camp is mounting and needs to be
addressed urgently.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tension High on Ugandan, Rwandan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Ding Qilin and Wang Shangzhi
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Tension has been high on the border
between Uganda and Rwanda since their troops went into clashes
last Friday in Kisangani, a northeast city of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan army sources, about 50 Rwandan soldiers
were killed during the fighting, while the Rwandan side said its
troops had killed at least 12 Ugandan soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Both of the two neighboring countries in east Africa had troops
 stationed in Kisangani, the third largest city of the DRC, to
support rival rebels fighting to overthrow DRC President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday's clashes occurred almost nine months later since
the last bloody fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan armies which
left about 300 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the fighting, the two countries have been reportedly
amassing troops on their common borders. "Ugandan soldiers have
been heavily deployed in the areas of Kamwezi and Mirama hills,"
said Rwandan army spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro.
</P>
<P>
Ndahiro stressed that this deployment is rather unusual but
Rwanda has not taken any measure, only to take note of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda also accused Rwanda of amassing troops on the
border.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from Ugandan Defense Ministry on
Wednesday, the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) was deploying massively
on the Rwandan side and a small force of Uganda People's Defense
Force (UPDF) was watching the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We express our concern over this development but continue to
exercise maximum restraint," said Ugandan Defense Minister
Stephen Kavuma. He urged Rwanda to reciprocate Uganda's stand for
"peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
Although both Uganda and Rwanda have denied heavy deployment of
troops on the border, the situation in Kisangani and the common
border areas have become tense.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops went into clash once again on Monday
 following last Friday's fighting. Kavuma accused the RPA of
advancing to regain their position at Bangoka airport which they
lost in the previous fighting.
</P>
<P>
According to a New Vision report, the UPDF has cut off the air
links from the Entebbe International Airport to Kisangani
following persistent fighting between the two neighbor countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have instructions not to allow any plane to take off from
here. If there are any flights between Entebbe and Kisangani, it
should be after clearance from Kisangani where the trouble is. The
situation is still bad, we cannot guarantee people's safety,"
Ugandan air force sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
At Mirama Hills on the common border where the two countries
have amassed troops, tension has gripped the residents. The New
Vision Thursday reported that the residents had suspended
cultivating their fields fearing an outbreak of war.
</P>
<P>
Traders at the Mirama customs post have been evacuating their
families and property out of the town, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier James Kazini, Army Chief of Staff and Commander of
UPDF operations in the DRC, blamed the RPA for trying to show the
world that Rwanda is the "regional power".
</P>
<P>
"This time we are ready for them. If they don't stop attacking
our troops, we may respond with full force and they will be
crushed," Kazini was quoted as saying by Ugandan media.
</P>
<P>
He said the Uganda army is now beginning to consider the RPA as
"enemies" because of their continued provocations and attacks
against the UPDF. "At first we did not take their attacks
seriously, but we are beginning to realize these people may be
real enemies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda had been close allies for years, but
divisions emerged when they began backing rival rebel factions in
the war against DRC President Lauren Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will meet with his Rwandan
counterpart Paul Kagame on Sunday at Mwanza in northern Tanzania.
They are supposed to discuss the demilitarization of Kisangani and
improvement of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
But observers here said that it is still in doubt if the
meeting will ease the tension between the two former allies.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Complains of Deploying U.N. Peacekeepers In S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has written
to the United Nations to express its displeasure at the "premature
deployment" of Zambian officers and soldiers to some parts of
Sierra Leone on a peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian troops in Sierra Leone were prematurely deployed
and had not been provided with all the required logistics such as
maps, President Frederick Chiluba said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 Zambian peacekeepers were captured and held hostage by
rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) last week.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who joined hundreds of Zambians gathering in Lusaka
for an intercession mass for the U.N. peacekeepers, explained that
the soldiers were called in without giving them logistics to
re-enforce a Kenyan contingent that had been attacked by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
However, the development in the West African country would not
deter Zambia from participating in future peacekeeping missions,
the president said, adding that Zambia maintains its policy of
peace and will not relent in helping bring peace globally.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Refused to Confirm to Host Ugandan, Rwandan Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has not yet
confirmed on hosting in Dar es Salaam a well-publicized
reconciliatory summit involving Ugandan and Rwandan leaders this
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Acting permanent secretary in the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs and International Cooperation Joshua Opanga told the
official Daily News in Dar es Salaam on Thursday that the
government is not aware of the said summit.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian media has reported that Ugandan president Yoweri
Museveni and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame will meet in the
Tanzanian capital city under the chairmanship of Tanzanian
president Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
"I have also heard the reports on the radio. I am trying to
check with relevant government authorities to establish whether
the forum is there or not," the official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministry will inform the public accordingly on the
progress concerning the event, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan and Rwandan troops based in the northeast town of
Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) clashed
with each other last Friday and this monday, which has increased
military tensions both in the DRC and along the common border of
Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Following the Kisangani clashes, a United Nations delegation
visited president Museveni in his hometown of Mbarara to ask him
meet Kagame in a bid to end their hostility as a continued
military confrontation in the DRC between the two countries is
regarded as a threat to the Lusaka Peace Accord signed last July.

<HEADLINE> Attempt to Hijack Plane Foiled in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The crew of an EgyptAir plane foiled a
hijacking attempt by an Egyptian man with a pot of cream between
Cairo and the southern city of Aswan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Holding an object which he said was a bomb, the hijacker, named
as Shaaban Ali, 34, demanded to be taken to an unspecified
destination, Egypt Middle East News Agency quoted police officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Ali, a construction worker from Ismailiya, a city at the
center of the Suez Canal, was overpowered by the crew of the
aircraft, an Airbus A321 with 19 passengers aboard, and the object
turned out to be a pot of cream, the police officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed at Luxor, a tourist resort between Cairo and
Aswan, and Ali was handed over to police before the plane continued
its journey.
</P>
<P>
The police investigating the incident said later that Ali has no
links with Islamist groups, and has no police record. But they are
continuing their inquiries to determine Ali's motives.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)Security Council to Meet on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
decided to hold an open meeting at 8:00 p.m. EST on Thursday to
discuss the latest development in Sierra Leone as the United
Nations is preparing to defend the nation's capital Freetown,
diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in a closed emergency meeting on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of increasing military activity between
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and government
soldiers in Sierra Leone, the United Nations is persisting in
efforts to stabilize the situation by reinforcing and
consolidating the U.N. force in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
With the offer of logistical support from a number of
countries, battalions from Bangladesh, India and Jordan are
expected to arrive in Sierra Leone between May 20 and the end of
the month, the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said.
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to bring the current 87,00-member U.N.
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone to its full strength of 11,100,
authorized by a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations dispatched the peacekeepers into the West
African nation to monitor a peace accord signed by rebels and the
Sierra Leonean Government in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has ordered its peacekeepers Wednesday to
take up defensive positions and prepare to fight rebels advancing
toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do what we have to do to defend ourselves and the
government," Eckhard said. "We hope it won't come to a pitched
battle, but we are preparing for one."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Nations officials said they still know
little or nothing about the whereabouts and condition of about 500
peacekeepers who were taken hostage by rebels early last week --
the incident that precipitated the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
One detachment of 208 Zambian soldiers, who were captured
together with their armored personnel carriers, was reported to
have been taken to Koidu, a rebel stronghold in eastern Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on the fate of another contingent of 200
Zambians who disappeared later. Attempts to deliver food and other
supplies to the captured U.N. soldiers have largely been thwarted.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Concerned over Slow Peace Process in Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Thursday voiced its deep concern over the continued
failure of the parties in Georgia to achieve a comprehensive
political settlement, which includes a settlement on the political
status of Abkhazia within the State of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Council reviewed the report by the U.N.
Secretary-General on the latest developments in the country which
was submitted to the Council late last month.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement, the Security Council noted the
adverse impact that this failure has on the humanitarian situation,
economic development and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon the parties to display the political
will required for a breakthrough and to spare no efforts in order
to achieve substantive progress without further delay.
</P>
<P>
The Council strongly reaffirmed the imprescriptible right of
all refugees and internally displaced persons directly affected by
the conflict to return to their homes in secure and signified
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Council called on the parties to agree upon and to take,
in the nearest future, concrete steps towards implementing
effective measurers to guarantee the security of those who
exercise their unconditional right to return, including those who
have already returned.
</P>
<P>
The Council encouraged the Abkhaz side to continue the process
of improvement of security conditions for returnees.
</P>
<P>
The Council encouraged the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General to continue his efforts, in close cooperation
with the Russian Federation, in its capacity as facilitator, the
Group of Friends of the Secretary-General and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, to further the Geneva peace
process.

</P>
<P>
The ANA quoted participants at a seminar on traffic safety in

UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The opening plenary of the

said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased, of course, that Secretary-General Kofi Annan

<P>
"beyond Mr.Annan's presence, however, we are extremely pleased
to be able to open our meeting with a wide range of leaders,
representing east and west, north and south, and the broad range

</P>
<P>
In seeking to contribute to the Millennium Assembly and the
Millennium Summit of the United Nations, civil society
organizations are organizing the Millennium Forum, to be held on

</P>
<P>
The Forum will focus on six main sub-themes under the main
theme of "the United Nations for the 21 Century.'

<HEADLINE> U.N. Is Not to Aid Independence of Kosovo, China Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- "The presence of the United
Nations in Kosovo is by no means for the purpose of helping the
locals gain independence," and the U.N. Mission in the Yugoslav
province (UNMIK) "should get this message across unmistakably to
the local people," China said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingfan, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told an open Security Council meeting that "It is allowed
no room for any mistake on this crucial policy."
</P>
<P>
"We support UNMIK's proposal to establish a Joint Committee so
as to enhance the substantive cooperation between the U.N. Mission
and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met Thursday in an open session to
discuss a report by the Security Council Mission to Kosovo, headed
by Anwarul Chowdhury, the Bangladeshi permanent representative to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The report indicates that ethnic reconciliation in Kosovo "is
a long and protracted process, and the international community
must be patient and persistent."
</P>
<P>
"However, the international community should never sit on its
hands toward any detrimental to ethnic reconciliation," he said. "
Any attempt either to discriminate against other ethnic groups in
Kosovo's public life or to pull Kosovo towards independence is
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
"It will give rise to new disturbances in the Balkans at large
and thus victimize people of all countries in this region
eventually," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "UNMIK should respect the sovereignty and
territorial integrity as well as the laws of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia and seek its cooperation and participation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some administrative measures currently adopted in Kosovo,
however, have undermined the sovereignty of the FRY," he said.
</P>
<P>
Examples include: ID documents have been issued in Kosovo
without the authorization by the FRY; stamps have been issued too;
the Albanian flag has been flying beside the U.N. flag at the
UNMIK compound in Kosovo; some foreign guests have visited Kosovo
without the notice to the FRY; and some countries, without prior
consultation with the FRY, have sent diplomatic representatives to
Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All this has led the locals to the wrong impression that
Kosovo is on its way to independence," he said. "Security Council
resolution 1244 reaffirms the commitment of all Member States to
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY."

<HEADLINE> China Concerned at Security Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China said here Thursday
that the security situation in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, the
physical security of Serbs and other minorities in particular, is
"still worrying."
</P>
<P>
Wang Yingfan, the Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told an open Security Council meeting that "Due to
the extreme lack of sense of safety and given the situation of the
Serbs and other minorities, there still exist enormous
difficulties in the way of the return of internally displaced
persons and refugees from third countries."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council met in an open meeting to discuss a
report of the Security Council Mission to Kosovo, headed by
Anwarul Chowdhury, the Bangladeshi permanent representative to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, more than 200,000 Serbs and people of other
minorities have fled the area and more than 4,000 incidents of
violence have taken place, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"While some of them have been anti-Albanian, most have been
against Serbs and other minorities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Pristina (the provincial capital of Kosovo) where there
once lived 40,000 Serbs and Montenegroins, now there are less than
100 Serbs," he said. "This is a horrible situation indeed."
</P>
<P>
"Since Serbs and people of other minority groups are not able
to return normally to their homes in Kosovo, it is impossible for
them to integrate into the society," he said. "Without the
integration, similarly, the 'strengthening of the multi-ethnic
interim administration' is out of the question."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council Mission said in its report that "efforts
to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at
the local level, including the establishment of multi-ethnic
municipal councils, administrative boards and rapid-impact
employment projects, could foster peaceful coexistence."
</P>
<P>
"The realization of this objective rests on the normal return
of people of all ethnic groups," which is closely linked to the
security situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming municipal elections, he said, the civil and
voter registration has already begun in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Council Mission report said, "It is unfortunate, however,
that all factions of the Kosovo Serb community have chosen no to
participate in this process, due to the current lack of physical
security and freedom of movement."
</P>
<P>
"This is a political reality in Kosovo that, the Chinese
delegation believes, deserves the full attention of the Security
Council and UNMIK," the U.N. Interim Administration in Kosovo, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, careful prior planning and preparation must be
done for the local elections in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The security situation must be improved to ensure physical
security and freedom of movement so that the elections could be
conducted in a free and peaceful atmosphere," he said. "The
registration of voters must ensure broad representation,
especially that of the minorities."
</P>
<P>
"To make this happen, necessary conditions still need to be
put in place," he said. "Otherwise, there is no way to guarantee
the fairness of the results of the elections. Elections in the
absence of broad-based participation will only result in the
intensification of ethnic conflicts."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Approves Africa, Caribbean Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 77 to 19, and sent it
to President Clinton for signature. The legislation, approved by a
vote of 309-to-110 in the House last week, would expand apparel
trade for 48 sub-Saharan nations and 25 Caribbean and Central
American nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, clothing made from U.S. yarn and fabric
could enter the country without duty or quotas. Clothing made in
Africa from African fabric would be allowed to rise from 1.5
percent of U.S. imports to 3.5 percent over eight years.
</P>
<P>
African exports of those products to the United States will be
boosted from about 250 million U.S. dollars now to an estimated 4.
2 billion, according to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
African nations where the gross domestic product is less than 1,
500 U.S. dollars a year per capita would be eligible for quota-
free benefits for four years in cases where they use third-country
fabric.

<HEADLINE> Greece Drawing Up Text on Aegean CBMs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece is in the process of drawing
up a text concerning the confidence-building measures (CBMs)
between Athens and Ankara in the eastern Aegean Sea, in response
to the proposals made by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem last
January, according to the Macedonian Press Agency (MPA) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The MPA said that Greece's two responsible ministries of
foreign affairs and defense are now cooperating closely to
determine the country's position on the CBMs.
</P>
<P>
But Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said at a press
briefing Thursday that Athens is not considering any proposal at
present over the CBMs.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the CBMs must be dealt with by the
representatives of the two countries within the framework of NATO,
Reppas said that Greece remained devoted to implementing the 1988
memorandum signed by the then foreign ministers of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean,
and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighboring countries have
since last June begun to improve their strained relations with the
holding of several rounds of low-level talks and the signing of a
number of bilateral cooperation pacts.
</P>
<P>
Later this month, both Greece and Turkey will participate in a
NATO military exercise, condemned "Dynamic Mix 2000," which will
take place mostly in southeastern Greece.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Court Hears Elian Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An appeals court in Atlanta of
the United States Thursday heard the case of six-year-old Cuban
boy Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
aggressively questioned both sides and asked whether Elian is too
young to apply for asylum and whether being from Cuba compromises
his father's parental rights.
</P>
<P>
The detailed questioning by the judges pushed the hearing to
one hour and 20 minutes, twice its scheduled length.
</P>
<P>
The judges said they would rule quickly, but indicated it would
be weeks before they decide.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives argued that the boy should be granted a
political asylum, but the boy's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez
maintains that he wants to take his son back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father, who was reunited with his son after federal
agents of Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) staged a
raid on April 22 to snatch Elian from the Miami relatives' home,
has asked the court to drop the asylum petition by Elian's Miami
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled in January that Elian was too young to apply for
asylum and that only Miguel Gonzalez could speak for his son.
</P>
<P>
A federal court upheld the ruling in March, but Elian's Miami
relatives headed by his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez appealed to
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
The three 11th Circuit judges ordered that Elian remain in the
country until they ruled on his appeal.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 of last year near a shipwreck
in the Atlantic sea off Florida after his mother and 10 others
were drowned when their immigrant smuggling boat capsized. Elian
was later brought to his Miami relatives' home.
</P>
<P>
Elian and his father, who are staying at the Wye Plantation
east of Washington awaiting for court action, did not appear at
the hearing. His father was represented by a lawyer while his
Miami relatives attended the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both the U.S. government and Juan Miguel say Elian
is not mature enough to make such choices whether to stay in U.S.
or return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
If the judges rule against the relatives, there is no assurance
the full 11th Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will hear their
appeals.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father also has asked the court to let him replace
Lazaro Gonzalez as the adult representing the boy in the lawsuit.
If the judges agree, Juan Miguel Gonzalez could drop the case.
</P>
<P>
Either side would have 45 days to ask all 12 judges of the 11th
Circuit to hear the case. If the court refused, the losing side
would have 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court.

<P>
BRUSSELS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Thursday agreed to the provision of exceptional financial
assistance to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, said that the assistance would be in the form of a straight
grant of up to 20 million euro (18.6 million U.S. dollars) as
macro-economic and structural adjustment funds.
</P>
<P>
The European Union finance ministers on Monday agreed to grant
the assistance to Montenegro pending the approval of the
commission and the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
This assistance is in addition to the European Union's aid
already envisaged for this year under the OBNOVA regulation and
the Food Security Program.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Solbes, EU commissioner for finance and economy, raised
the matter at the Lisbon European Union summit of heads of state
and government about the aid to Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, high representative of the EU Common foreign and
defense policy, said that the assistance would be delivered to
Montenegro very soon after approval.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Seek British Financial Support for Coffee Plantation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Agriculture Minister
Gilberto Buta Lutucuta has left here for Britain with the aim of
seeking financial support for coffee production in the central
Kwanza-sul Province.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the European country, Lutucuta is expected
to meet with British financial officials, the official news agency
Angop reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He is also to meet with Margareth Anstee, patroness of the
"British Forum on Angola".
</P>
<P>
Angolan Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is
currently engaged in the restart of coffee production in many
parts of the country, as from this agricultural season.
</P>
<P>
Angola was the fourth largest coffee-producing country in the
world in 1974, but it has been heavily hindered by the long-term
civil conflicts which not only forced the rural residents to leave
their homes but also destroyed many coffee plantations in the
central regions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Specify Peacekeeping Budget </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's opposition
Democratic Party Thursday called on the Defense Department to
inform parliament on the financial implications of sending a
contingent to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The department should also explain how the cost will be
provided for in the budget, the party's defense spokesman Philip
Schalkwyk said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Assembly on Wednesday, President Thabo
Mbeki said the United Nations will cover the costs of South
African soldiers deployed to form part of a headquarters group in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
According to Schalkwyk, the truth is that the government will
have to cover the initial cost and then be reimbursed by the U.N.
some time in the future.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the U.N. is reported to be nine years
behind in some reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party also calls on the Defense Department to
inform the public what the exact purpose of the mission is; to
provide an approximate budget for this mission; and to make known
the time frame for the U.N. reimbursement payments," he said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hails Zambia's Peace Efforts for Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain has praised Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba for his efforts to promote the peace
process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, shortly before
ending his two-day visit to Zambia, British Minister of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth affairs Peter Hain said Zambia is also
playing a crucial role in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support what Zambia is doing," he said, stressing
that " Britain, for its part, is supporting the United Nations
efforts to prevent further violations of the Lome Peace
Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"At my meeting with President Chiluba this morning, we covered
all aspects of Zambia's economic and political development as well
as a range of foreign policy issues," the minister told the press.
</P>
<P>
He said President Chiluba confirmed during the meeting that
Zambia would cooperate fully with the U.N. monitoring mechanism
and with any Southern African Development Community (SADC)
initiatives to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1295 on
Angolan issue.
</P>
<P>
"I am totally opposed to Jonas Savimbi's murderous war in
Angola. Britain joins with Namibia in pressing for effective
sanctions against the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed the hope to see a much stronger
partnership between Zambia and Britain and to see more economic
investment in Zambia involving more British businesses.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Minister Analyses Cause of Slow Indigenization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The slow pace of economic
indigenization in Zimbabwe can be attributed to the unstable
macro-economic environment characterized by the high budget
deficit. Minister for State Cephas Msipa, who is responsible
for state enterprises and indigenization, made these remarks here
on Thursday at a stakeholders workshop designed to launch the
research project on the status of economic indigenization.
</P>
<P>
Msipa said the high interest rates, high inflation and low
levels of domestic savings could also be attributed to the slow
strides taken in the implementation of the indigenization policy
which was approved by the government in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate finance, lack of production knowledge and inhibitive
 legislation, Msipa said, had also affected the progress in
indigenization.
</P>
<P>
The research project would assist the government and other
stakeholders in coming up with policy interventions with
measurable, achievable and time framed targets.
</P>
<P>
Msipa said, "We need to restore the dignity of our people and
to eradicate poverty by creating conditions that will give
opportunities for people to engage in productive and profitable
activities and businesses."
</P>
<P>
Chris Chetsanga, director-general of the scientific, Industrial
Research and Development Centre, will lead the team of researchers
for the study.
</P>
<P>
He said the project would cover the entire country in data
gathering to determine the state of indigenization.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this study is going to be a watershed to help Zimbabwe
on what needs to be done to achieve economic indigenization," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Third Round of Cyprus Talks May be Held on June 26 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has no
objection to holding the next round of U.N.-sponsored proximity
talks on Cyprus in Geneva at the end of June, government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou said Thursday at his daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported that the third round of talks,
originally scheduled for May 23 in New York, may postpone until
June 26 in Geneva, to enable President Glafcos Clerides to recover
from an operation to remove a polyp from his large intestine.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou said Clerides may go to Athens for talks with Greek
Premier Costas Simitis before the Geneva talks, for which no
timetable has been set yet.
</P>
<P>
"The government is working for the participation of President
Clerides in the talks and hopes that developments during the talks
will be such as to allow a fourth round to take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in reaction to a pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks have been held
between the leaders of the two communities, to pave the way for
substantive talks which may lead to a comprehensive settlement of
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
During the first two rounds of the talks, the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot communities outlined and clarified their positions on four
core issues, namely, security, constitution, property and
territory.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Provide 1.5 Bln Dollars to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
announced here Thursday that it will provide Bangladesh 1.5
billion U.S. dollars for the period covering 2001-2003.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Thursday organized by the
Bangladesh Resident Mission of the ADB, Rajat Nag, Deputy Director
of ADB's Programs West Department, said that the ADB 2000 Country
Programming Mission has just concluded the discussion on the
probable Country Assistance Plan (CAP) to Bangladesh for the
period 2001-2003.
</P>
<P>
An important aspect of the CAP prepared by the mission is that
it has now raised the annual allocation for Bangladesh from annual
average of 300 million U.S. dollars to about 500 million dollars
per year, Nag noted, adding that this is "a significant increase
in the planned lending volume, amounting to about 1.5 billion
dollars over the next three years."
</P>
<P>
There will be an additional grant element of about 20-30
million dollars over this period for technical assistance to the
country, the deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first CAP that has been prepared after the
government of Bangladesh and ADB signed a Poverty Reduction
Partnership Agreement on 3 April, 2000 when ADB President Chino
visited the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Nag stressed that the actual disbursements would
depend on the progress of reforms in various sectors and the
efficiency of project implementation by the government of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Briefing newsmen, Phiphit Suphaphiphat, Resident Representative
of ADB in Bangladesh, said that the ADB assistance program has
been prepared to complement Bangladeshi government's own
development program for poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Under the new poverty orientation, ADB operations will continue
to focus on basic infrastructure such as transportation, energy,
or water resource management, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Suphaphiphat pointed out that these infrastructure
projects will now be targeted more towards areas of high poverty
intensity to maximize the poverty reducing impact of these project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 2001-2003 CAP also included a large component
of social projects in primary education, secondary education and
basic urban services, which are also very effective in reducing
human poverty, he added.

Hun Sen made the remarks when he talked about the issue of
Khmer Rouge trial at a two-day conference on Cambodia Investment
2000 in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
"We will try the former Khmer Rouge leaders in accordance with
the law adopted by the National Assembly and the Senate as well as
at the circumstance of respecting the country's sovereignty," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Please, do not force us to agree with you or violate our
sovereignty," he stressed, blaming the foreign nations'
intervention on creating nearly three decades of civil war in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the trial issue shall be dominated by
Cambodia itself. "If we can not handle the issue properly, there
would be another civil war in the country," Hun Sen warned.
</P>
<P>
The government is waiting for a written confirmation from the U.
N.Secretary General Kofi Annan on a verbal agreement struck in
late April between Prime Minister Hun Sen and U.S. Senator John
Kerry who visited here two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen and Kerry settled on a plan for joint international-
Cambodian prosecution of former Khmer Rouge leaders after two days
of intense negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh also
said at the conference that "While a trial of the former Khmer
Rouge is very important..., I believe that we should not spend
significant resources for this issue."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Fall 0.2 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The retail sales fell a
surprising 0.2 percent in April to seasonally adjusted 266 billion
U.S. dollars, the biggest decline since July 1998, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In March, sales rose a revised 0.5 percent, stronger than the
government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The government said that a sharp drop in sales at gasoline
stations led last month's decline. But falling sales for cars,
clothing and building supplies also contributed to April's weaker-
than-expected performance.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline sales fell a sharp 2.3 percent in April following a
big 4.3 percent gain the month before. Prices at the pump peaked
in March but edged down in April, reflecting lower crude-oil
prices and increased production.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new cars and trucks declined by 0.7 percent in April
after a 1.4 percent decrease the month before. The auto industry
reported a record 17 million cars and light trucks sold in 1999
and is projecting lower but still robust sales for this year.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales were
unchanged in April, weaker than the 0.4 percent increase many
analysts were expecting. In March, retail sales excluding autos
rose a strong 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Clothing stores saw sales fall by 0.9 percent last month
following a 1.6 percent increase in March.
</P>
<P>
With the weather cold and dreary last month, sales at hardware,
building and garden supply stores fell 1.6 percent after posting a
sizable 4.8 percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
Sales at bars and restaurants fell 0.4 percent following a 1.2
percent rise in March.
</P>
<P>
But sales at grocery stores rose a strong 1.1 percent on top of
a 0.8 percent gain in March. Furniture store sales rose a modest 0.
3 percent, down from a 0.5 percent increase. Department stores
sales rose by 0.4 percent in April after a 0.7 percent increase
the month before.
</P>
<P>
Many of the nation's biggest chain stores last week reported
disappointing sales for April, something analysts blamed on the
dreary weather rather than a sweeping pullback in consumer
spending because of rising interest rates or stock market
volatility.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Meet on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
decided to hold an open meeting at 8:00 p.m. EST on Thursday to
discuss the latest development in Sierra Leone as the United
Nations is preparing to defend the nation's capital Freetown,
diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in a closed emergency meeting on
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of increasing military activity between
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and government
soldiers in Sierra Leone, the United Nations is persisting in
efforts to stabilize the situation by reinforcing and
consolidating the U.N. force in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
With the offer of logistical support from a number of
countries, battalions from Bangladesh, India and Jordan are
expected to arrive in Sierra Leone between May 20 and the end of
the month, the U.N. spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said.
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to bring the current 87,000-member U.N.
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone to its full strength of 11,100,
authorized by a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations dispatched the peacekeepers into the West
African nation to monitor a peace accord signed by rebels and the
Sierra Leonean Government in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has ordered its peacekeepers Wednesday to
take up defensive positions and prepare to fight rebels advancing
toward Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"We'll do what we have to do to defend ourselves and the
government," Eckhard said. "We hope it won't come to a pitched
battle, but we are preparing for one."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, United Nations officials said they still know
little or nothing about the whereabouts and condition of about 500
peacekeepers who were taken hostage by rebels early last week --
the incident that precipitated the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
One detachment of 208 Zambian soldiers, who were captured
together with their armored personnel carriers, was reported to
have been taken to Koidu, a rebel stronghold in eastern Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
There was no word on the fate of another contingent of 200
Zambians who disappeared later. Attempts to deliver food and other
supplies to the captured U.N. soldiers have largely been thwarted.

<HEADLINE> Online Journalism Awards Set in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia University, which also issues Pulitzer Prizes and
National Magazine Awards, announced that it has established Online
Journalism Awards in conjunction with the Online News Association,
the Washington Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The prizes will help set the standards in the world for online
journalism, said Tom Goldstein, dean of Columbia's journalism
school.
</P>
<P>
Experts have noticed a vexing paradox in the Internet media. On
one hand, the Internet is well suited to breaking news, war
correspondence, courtroom scenes and continuous reports.
Journalists cover events that are live and urgent, readers talk
back, electronic links are forged, instant polls created.
</P>
<P>
However, the new media also has caused abuse and angst. The
siren call of "get it first" often impeded that traditional credo
of "get it right." Several major newspapers have been burned in
their zeal to rush a story on line minus editing or fact checking.
And retractions have appeared for stories that turned out to be
glorified, brilliantly packaged rumor.
</P>
<P>
After demonstrating what not to do, newly chastened on-line
journalism now seems to be entering a self-examining phase, the
Washington Times said.
</P>
<P>
The on-line group was founded in 1999 by some 30 editors and
writers. Members come from the Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine,
National Public Radio, the New York Times and others.
</P>
<P>
The 11 awards will help recognize and encourage excellence in
such fields as commentary, breaking news, service and enterprise
journalism.
</P>
<P>
The awards also will cite "creative use of the medium,"
including a story's interactive qualities, design and navigation
tools. But the emphasis will be placed on "compelling use of the
new technologies for storytelling."

<HEADLINE> Russian General Confirms Attack on Servicemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A ranking general confirmed Thursday
that 18 servicemen of the Interior Ministry were killed in an
attack near Chechnya earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Three more servicemen were wounded and one missing after the
attack by guerrillas on a convoy of the Interior Ministry in the
Sunzha district of Ingushetia, a tiny province bordering the
breakaway Chechen republic, said Colonel General Valery Manilov,
first deputy chief of the General Staff.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said the convoy attacked was not part of the federal
combined forces in the North Caucasus, but was attached to an
interior regiment headquartered in North Ossetia, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The convoy, including two Urals trucks and an armored vehicle,
was ferrying interior troops unrelated to the main federal force
in Chechnya, Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles came under grenade fire from woods along the road
to Galashki. One of the trucks sustained a direct strike by a
grenade.
</P>
<P>
"Pursuit of and a search for the attackers has been organized
and we hope for success in tracking them down," Manilov said,
describing the action as "a treacherous bandit raid in a territory
where the counter-terrorist operation was not conducted."
</P>
<P>
This was the sixth attack on federal convoys in the North
Caucasus since early arch, but the previous attacks all happened
inside Chechnya, where federal troops are in the middle of a
military campaign against separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 federal servicemen died in those attacks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Launches Navigation Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force launched a
navigation satellite into orbit by a Boeing-built Delta rocket in
Florida State Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 12-story rocket carrying the satellite blasted off from
Cape Canaveral with a brilliant flash of fire and a thunderous
roar at 9:48 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Nestled in the nose cone of the rocket was a 42-million-U.S.-
dollar Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite built by Lockheed
Martin. It was designed to replace an 11-year-old orbiting
satellite that recently failed.
</P>
<P>
This was the U.S. Air Force's second rocket launch from Cape
Canaveral in three days. On Monday, the Air Force launched a 250-
million-dollar missile-warning satellite into orbit by using of
the country's most powerful unmanned rocket.
</P>
<P>
The 432-million-dollar Titan 4B rocket was carrying a Defense
Support Program missile-warning satellite that will be able to
detect and pinpoint missile launches and nuclear detonations.
</P>
<P>
The GPS was originally conceived to allow U.S. armed forces to
determine their exact position within a few meters. The system is
now widely used by civilians. GPS-based navigation systems have
found their way into boats, aircraft, cars and even golf carts.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls on Croatia to Play Role of Influence in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a meeting at the Elysee presidential palace with
Croatian President Stipe Mesic who is on a visit here, Chirac said
that the democratic evolution in Croatia is a signal of hope in
the Balkans and has a value of example for southeast Europe.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, quoted Chirac
as saying during the meeting that he hopes the example of Croatia
can``unleash a dynamism in the region'' and that the future of the
Balkans lies in its rapprochement with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Chirac promised Mesic that the European Union will start the
negotiations on an agreement of association with Croatia during
the later half this year, when France takes over the rotating
presidency of the union.
</P>
<P>
The French president praised Croatia for its joining NATO's``
partnership for peace'' program two days earlier and the``
development of active relations'' between Zagreb and NATO.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction over Croatia's ``new
orientations'' of policy in respect of the Dayton agreement and
the Paris agreement signed in 1995 and 1997, which put an end to
the conflict in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
France and the European Union fully support this new
orientation of Zagreb and wish its full success, said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Mesic told the press after the meeting that his talks with
Chirac were very fruitful and that he is happy with France's
support to Croatia's intention to join the European institutions
in a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he has invited Chirac to visit Croatia.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ponders Sending Troops, Choppers to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that it is
considering sending a helicopter air support unit to take part in
the U.N. mission to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Thursday, the Russian Foreign ministry
said that the unit would be tasked with "assisting in the
provision of security to U.N. personnel, transportation, including
(transportation)for medical purposes and reconnaissance flights."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Russian transport aircraft are getting
involved in transporting U.N. military contingents from other
countries to the war-torn African country.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had earlier appealed for
assistance in transporting three peacekeeping battalions to Sierra
Leone from Bangladesh, India and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"Russia continues to follow with concern the deteriorating
situation in Sierra Leone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military has expressed its readiness to dispatch
peacekeeping troops to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the
General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, told a press conference
that helicopter pilots and elite army units with special training
could be deployed there.
</P>
<P>
The contingent would be around 100 troops, who would make up "a
helicopter group and landing troops to match," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency, quoting diplomatic sources, said the
Russian helicopter units would not take part in any hostilities in
Sierra Leone if sent.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry has drafted documents on the
deployment of four Mi-24 helicopters and about 110 pilots and
technicians to Sierra Leone, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 15 Russian military observers in the U.N.
mission to Sierra Leone and 112 civilians, helicopter crew and
technicians working on contract in the African nation.

<HEADLINE> Russia Repeats Threat to Quit Peacekeeping in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia reiterated its threat
Thursday that it would withdraw from the peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo if Yugoslavia's territorial integrity is not preserved.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the
Russian General Staff, said in the first stage of implementing U.N.
Security Council resolution 1244, "Russia's participation has been
important in preserving Yugoslavia's integrity, preventing arms
deliveries to Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, "not one of the resolution's provisions is being
implemented today. On the contrary, this decision has considerably
devalued, and the Kosovo Liberation Army is being restored on any
pretext," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3,600 Russian troops in the Yugoslav province
as part of a 40,000 multinational peacekeeping force, or KFOR,
which were sent following the end of a 78-day bombing campaign on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We categorically object to such a course of events, although
we will continue to participate in the peacekeeping operation as
long as the slightest chance remains for carrying out the U.N.
Security Council resolution," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
"When we see that our participation becomes accessory to
Yugoslavia's breakup, a political decision could possibly be made
to end our activity in KFOR," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia "will not be an accomplice to Yugoslavia's
disintegration,"Manilov stressed.

<P>
BERLIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Martina Hingis of
Switzerland defeated Croatian Silvija Talaja in straight sets for
a quarter-finals berth at the German Open women's tennis
tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 victory, the world No. 1 and top seed
of the tournament extended her winning streak to 12 matches.

Undefeated since coming back from a month-layoff to win last

first set before buckling down to win the tie break.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who regained her top ranking in women's tennis last
week from Lindsay Davenport of the United States, fought off two
points while trailing 5-6 in the first set which lasted for 57
minutes.

<HEADLINE> England Labor China in Thomas Cup, Indonesia Go Through  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China sweated with a 4-1 win
over England in the first Thomas Cup Finals match here on Thursday
while Indonesia showed their strength and confidence of reigning
the trophy in a 5-0 rout of Sweden here.
</P>
<P>
In the Uber Cup Finals for women at the same Putra Stadium,
Denmark and Indonesia went through as Denmark overtook Malaysia 4-
1 and Indonesia toppled Japan 3-2.
</P>
<P>
Xia Xuanze, the All-England champion in Birmingham in March,
crashed Colin Haughton 15-2, 15-3 in the first singles match for
China.
</P>
<P>
But England soon found China's breaking point as Nathan
Robertson and Simon D. Archer displayed a brilliant comeback win
over Zhang Jun and Yu Jinhao, 10-15, 17-16, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Zhang/Yu squandered the best chance to take the tie 3-0 for
China when they led 15-14 in the second game. But the Englishmen
swamped them by fast footsteps to take the game and the match.
</P>
<P>
China did not leave another chance for England to create a
surprise when Ji Xinpeng, who was crowned in the Japan Open last
month, took the second singles and set the pace for the tie.
</P>
<P>
"If our doubles pairs play like today in the rest games of the
tournament, we won't win the trophy," Chinese chief coach Li
Yongbo said. "I'll change the doubles pairings in the next match
against Sweden."
</P>
<P>
But Li said he was satisfied with Xian and Ji, who played their
debuts in the Thomas Cup Finals. "They had showed what we can rely
on," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Indonesia gained great confidence from their
easy win, pledging to produce harder time in the following matches.
</P>
<P>
"This was just our first match in the finals. We'll play a
greater game against England." Indonesia coach Sumaryono said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia delivered a formidable message to their opponents by
the two world top ranked doubles pairs, Candra Wijaya/Tony Gunawan
and Ricky Ahmad Subagja/Rexy Mainaky, who surrendered just 13
points in the two doubles matches.
</P>
<P>
World number two player Martin Camilla started her sweep run of
the first singles matches in the Uber Cup with a 11-0, 11-4
victory over Malaysia's Mee Fen Ng.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's second doubles duo Ann-Lou Jorgensen/Mette
Schjoldager were hammered by Ang Li Peng/Chor Hooi Yee, 15-8, 15-1,
in the fourth matches, after the Danes had claimed the victory
from the first three wins.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's women lost the first singles when Lidya
Djaelawijaya cracked down before Yasuko Mizui, 11-5, 11-4. but
they won the next singles and both doubles games for the first win.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Pursues New Strategies for Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore minister said here
Thursday that his country is pursuing new strategies to ensure
food supply and safety with an aim to meet the challenges in the
supply of safe food and to keep exotic animal and plant diseases
out of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan
elaborated the strategies while addressing at the inaugural dinner
and launch of logo of the Agri-Food &AMP; Veterinary Authority (AVA)
which was newly established on the basis of former Primary
Production Department under his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The strategies he referred to cover diversification of food
sources, strengthening assurance of food safety at the source,
upgrading professional and technical expertise to detect new
contaminants, and developing life science especially molecular
biology and gene technology.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government will push for diversification
of food sources by allowing companies to invest in food projects
locally and in other countries.
</P>
<P>
"By investing in the farming industry, we will have control
over the productions systems and can better ensure the supply and
safety of our food," he added.
</P>
<P>
On safety of food, he said that AVA currently accredits farms
and food processing establishments for the export of food to
Singapore and will place officers in major food source countries
to augment the inspection of food supplies at source and to
improve the assurance of food safety.
</P>
<P>
He also said that AVA will monitor closely international
developments in the chemical, pharmaceutical and biologics
industry and continue to sharpen its staff's diagnostic and
analytical capabilities through regular training and by fully
utilizing cutting-edge technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
The minister gave emphasis to undertaking research in the life
science, especially molecular biology and gene technology, and
gaining a competitive edge in the rapidly-growing global
agribiotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
"Their potential benefits in food production cannot ignored,"
he said." Gene technology can significantly enhance the quality
and nutritive values of foods."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the fact that Singapore is not an
agricultural country is not a constraint and underlined that
novel products created in laboratories can be grown elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, a city state, depends most part of its food supply
on imports from abroad. By its own, it can only supply 1.5 percent
of poultry, 10 percent of fish, 30 percent of eggs and six percent

<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Mental illnesses in Rwanda have
been on the dramatic increase, which often afflict those in teens,
Rwandan News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Josse Nyetera, national counsellor at the
Psycho-social Centre, some mental disorders relate to the effects
of the 1994 genocide, when children witnessed their parents being
tortured and brutally killed.
</P>
<P>
"The Psycho-social Centre handles patients of epilepsy who
number to 68 each month, those with psychiatric trouble numbering
to 85 cases and 95 persons suffering from phychosomatic ailments",
said Nyetera.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 300 mental disorder patients are
handled in a month at the centre.
</P>
<P>
"Some mental illness are caused by the post traumatic disorder
syndrome and untreated trauma", Nyetera added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Prime Minister on Zimbabwean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said on Thursday that efforts are under way by regional
leaders to solve the current land crisis in Zimbabwe, but nothing
will be gained by making inflammatory public declarations.
</P>
<P>
"You don't use petrol to put out a fire", he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Mozambican government is in contact with the
main Zimbabwean opposition party, the Movement for Democratic
Change (MDC), Mocumbi said: "I don't want to make a public
statement about that", adding that "Mozambican diplomacy is quiet
diplomacy. That's to bring results."
</P>
<P>
As for the remarks critical of Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe made by former South African President Nelson Mandela on
Saturday, Mocumbi said he was sure that Mandela "is not inciting
the Zimbabwean people to overthrow the government".
</P>
<P>
Mocumbi denied that possible investment by Zimbabwean white
commercial farmers in Mozambique was directly linked to the
situation in their own country.
</P>
<P>
"We have always looked for partners who can transfer
technology, including in agriculture," he said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that as recently as Wednesday he met with potential
 investors from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in acquiring Zimbabwean know-how", said
Mocumbi. "But the matter should not be politicized".

Transair flight took place without any problems.

<HEADLINE> Lamy Hopes Beijing Trip to Conclude Deal with China on WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Pascal Lamy, European Union (EU)
commissioner for trade affairs, said Thursday that he hoped to
conclude a deal with China on its accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) during his trip to Beijing next week.
</P>
<P>
Lamy said before his trip to China for a new round of
negotiations that he could not come back to the European Council
or the European Parliament without any progress.
</P>
<P>
Lamy will depart for Beijing on Sunday, one day before the EU-
China talks start. An EU team is already in Beijing making
preparations.
</P>
<P>
"The EU believes that China is committed to joining the WTO,"
said Lamy, "and the Chinese government is running internal risks
to join the WTO. The EU, therefore, must give credit to it."
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that joining the global trade body is
like joining a club that plays games in accordance with specific
rules.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the upcoming United States Congress vote on
China's permanent normal trade relations will influence the
negotiations, Lamy said the vote is a matter of the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I am sure about is that a bilateral deal will
contribute toward the vote," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was optimistic about the Beijing trip, the
Frenchman said: "I don't think I'm extremely optimistic but I'm
realistic. Maybe we'll get there and maybe not."
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European bloc is asking China to open more of its
telecommunications market. "The EU wants its stake and share in
the market to increase substantially to around 50 percent," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Next week's talks in Beijing will be the fourth round this year
between the EU and China. The earlier rounds were held in January
and February.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Postponed Until May 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Lockerbie trial
was adjourned on Thursday till May 23 after the prosecution and
the defense counsel struck an agreement on certain evidence.
</P>
<P>
The three Scottish judges of the court agreed to adjourn the
six-day preliminary trial and jumped to the next stage of
proceedings with technical and forensic evidence.
</P>
<P>
It took the Scottish police more than two years to conclude
that the evidence found from around the crash site pointed to the
two Libyans who were accused of conspiracy to murder and breaching
the international aircraft safety act.
</P>
<P>
As the Scots law requires that the court establish the origins
of all incriminating evidence before it can be linked to the
accused, the prosecution and investigators have been trying to
identify dozens of bits of debris found by the police and
civilians after the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, being
tried under the Scottish law at a special Scottish court in the
Netherlands, were suspected in the bombing of the PanAm Flight 103
that killed 259 people on board and 11 others on the ground on
December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the two will be sentenced to life imprisonment
and serve their jail terms in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited trial is expected to last at least a year and
the court holds sessions almost daily except for a summer recess
between July 28 and August 22.

<HEADLINE> Martin Says Gong the Only Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- World champion Camilla Martin
said here on Thursday her only rival in the singles matches of the
Uber Cup is China's top player Gong Zhichao.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old world number two from Denmark said Gong would
be the one who could prevent her from making a clean sweep of her
first singles matches.
</P>
<P>
"The last time I met her was in the Grand Prix Finals in Brunei.
I lost," said Martin. "She (Gong) is a very good player. I think
the match against her will be 50-50."
</P>
<P>
Gong, ranked first in the world, had won the All-England and
the Japanese Open earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who admitted playing as first singles is a tough
responsibility, said winning the first point is important to boost
the morale of her teammates.
</P>
<P>
"Every match is difficult. I'll try to do my best. It's a
rough task to start first in the Uber Cup Finals, but I'll win all,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
The Denmark's top-seeded player said she would take her likely
opposition in the first singles with a good records against them
in recent meetings.
</P>
<P>
"I've never lost to Japan's first singles (Yasuko Mizui), but
lost twice to Indonesian Linya (Djaelawijaya). But I beat her
easily in the GP Finals in our latest meeting."
</P>
<P>
"Against South Korea (Kim Ji Hyun), not much problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
Martin went through her first singles match smoothly on
Thursday when she routed Malaysia's Ng Mee Fen 11-0, 11-4.
</P>
<P>
Denmark and Malaysia are in the same group with Indonesia and
Japan, with the other group including China, South Korea, Sweden
and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> No More Clowing Around for Ong  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Call him the clown prince of
the Malaysian Thomas Cup squad if you wish, but Ong Ewe Hock is
Malaysia's most improved shuttler in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
Ong, Malaysia's second singles player in the Thomas Cup Finals
here, had been through a slump, but coach Kwan Yoke Meng said the
veteran's enthusiasm and form is back to help Malaysia's cause.
</P>
<P>
"He is the most improved player and is capable of delivering
against any team in the competition," said Kwan at the Putra
stadium here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"He is not the same player he used to be and has been very
serious in training. I expect him to be a threat to all our
rivals."
</P>
<P>
Since losing to Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark in the third
round of the Japan Open last month, Ong had been putting extra
hours in training.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old has improved on his fitness and his strokes are
looking sharper.
</P>
<P>
"Thomas Cup was one of the reasons which helped me to buck up,"
Ong said. "I have been serious in training in the last two months.
"
</P>
<P>
"You can't afford to fool around in team events as it will
affect the whole squad. I am glad that I have recovered my form."
</P>
<P>
Having a fine Thomas Cup record, Ong is not concerned about the
reputation of some of his established opponents.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet top players like world number three Poul-
Erik Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark, Ji Xinpeng of China and Taufik
Hidayat of Indonesia should Malaysia go through to the final.
</P>
<P>
"It will not be right to say that I will beat all of them but
they need to be at their best to topple me," Ong said.
</P>
<P>
However, the only worry for Ong is that the tends to get
carried away and play to the gallery.
</P>
<P>
"I've always had that problem as I like to entertain the crowd
but this time I will be more focused," Ong pledged.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's computer systems were
scarcely affected by the recent computer virus "I Love You" thanks
to a security network established in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Shanghai Computer Virus Prevention Center said
only several dozen computers owned by individuals and overseas-
funded businesses in Shanghai were hit by the virus.
</P>
<P>
This is in contrast with reports that many computer systems
around the world were infected on May 4 as the virus, "ILOVEYOU"
in e-mail massages, overwhelmed networks and burrowed into
computer hard drives, destroying files containing valuable photos
and videos.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, which aims to become an international information
center in the coming century, has taken a series of measures to
increase computer system security in the past years.
</P>
<P>
It has formed an information security evaluation and
certification center to tighten security control on computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
About 10 to 15 percent of its computer network development
funds are being used for network security purposes.
</P>
<P>
To date 86 percent of Shanghai's information networks have had
security products installed.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- As China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) draws nearer, the country will introduce
more effective measures to further open its domestic markets to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made today by Shi Guangsheng, minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) in a keynote
speech at an 11th Annual Corporate Conference luncheon for the US'
s Asia Society in Asia.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the new century and with the prospect of China's
entry into WTO, Shi said, China will push ahead its opening-up
drive, initiated in the late 1970s, in a more active manner. The
move will create new opportunities for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
By joining the WTO, China will surely inject vitality into the
global economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral and multilateral talks on China's accession into WTO
has entered the final stage, the foreign trade minister said,
adding China's entry into the world trade body is just around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
"On accession into WTO, China will play a constructive role
together with other members of the world trade body in promoting
economic and trade cooperation, drafting multilateral trading
rules and advancing the establishment of a new international
economic order," said Shi.
</P>
<P>
In the next ten years, China will try hard to maintain a fast,
sustained economic growth while carrying out economic reforms and
promote science and technology.

research and technological development centers in China or invest
in high- and new-technological businesses.
</P>

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China is actively participating
in the world's new economy competition in an effort to globalize
its economy, said Shi Guangsheng, Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China closely follows the development of the "new economy" and
will seize opportunities and face challenges that may arise, he
said at the U.S. Asia Society's 11th Annual Corporate Conference.
</P>
<P>
China is capable of entering the "new economy" because the
country has the largest potential network market and its e-
commerce has developed rapidly in recent years, said John Wang,
chairman of the Beijing Everest E-Commerce and Network Service Co.
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the new economy, based on network and
technical creation, provides a rare opportunity for China to
restructure its economy, and will also serve as a major stimulus
for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The number of China's internet users exceeds 10 million, and
it is predicted that the figure will double in two years. By 2002,
China is expected to become the largest internet market in the
world, with new network and e-commerce companies emerging every
day.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, the country's top industrial and commercial
center, IT industry has grown 30 percent annually in recent years
and its output value is expected to surpass 100 billion yuan this
year.

Among the countries most seriously hit by the financial crisis,
the Republic of Korea has made the fastest recovery, with economic
growth exceeding 10 percent last year. ROK Minister of Finance and
Economy Lee Hun-Jai said in his speech that reasons accounting for
South Korea's economic recovery are timely readjustment of macro-
economic policies, the implementation of all-round reforms and the
improvement of social insurance system.
</P>
<P>
Participants pointed out that improving scientific and
technological competitiveness is an effective way to strengthen
economic competitiveness. Most Asian countries have begun to
increase input in science and technology, and are actively
training professionals for scientific and technological
development.
</P>
<P>
W.Wayne Booder, vice chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said
that Asian countries should seek more cooperation with
international conglomerates, practice fair and just tariff and
trade rules, provide a fair competition environment and raise
business efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 40 years, the collective gross domestic product
of Asian countries has risen from 10 percent of the global total
to a quarter of the total. In the past two years, Asian countries
again surprised the world by quickly shaking off the negative
consequences of the financial crisis. This indicates that Asia has
great potential in its economic development and is a powerful
competitor in the global economy.

SHANGHAI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the U.S. Asia Society
's 11th Annual Corporate Conference believe that Asia, recovering
from the Asian financial crisis, will become increasingly
competitive in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a round-table meeting on the topic of "Asia's
Competitiveness in Global Economy", Professor Justin Yifu Lin from
the Hong Kong Polytechnic University said that Asia managed to
maintain its competitiveness after being severely hit by the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"To improve competitiveness, it is imperative to pursue
industries that have advantages," he said. "For Asian countries,
labor-intensive industries are where the advantages reside."
</P>
<P>
A.B. Colayco, Jardine Matheson Country Chairman in the
Philippines, said that in addition to traditional industries, Asia
has also had fast development in the e-commerce sector. Within 10
to 20 years, the "new economy" will become the main force in the
world's economy.
</P>
<P>
Participants generally agreed that the recent financial crisis
hit some countries and regions especially hard because they failed
to adapt themselves to increasing economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries have made great efforts in economic
restructuring, improving their financial system and developing
science and education. These are all critical to Asia's
competitiveness.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China called for taking effective
measures to create a favorable environment for the healthy growth
of children, just weeks before the June 1 International Children's
Day.
</P>
<P>
A joint circular issue by the All-China Women's Federation, the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of
Communist Youth League of China, the Ministry of Education and
other departments urged that joint efforts be made to care for the
children, especially to promote their education.
</P>
<P>
This year's celebration activities should focus on facing
challenges in the new century with a nationwide education campaign
promoting patriotism, morality, discipline and law.
</P>
<P>
Education departments should guide students to take part in
more extracurricular activities and relieve their pressure at
school and home.
</P>
<P>
More suitable films and TV serials should be available for
children. Museums, technology exhibition halls and parks should
open to children at a discount and for longer time.
</P>
<P>
Supervision departments are asked to check public entertainment
facilities, children's food and toys to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
The "Youngsters Return Home Safely" Project launched in early
April by the Ministry of Public Security should be further carried
out nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Former Turkish PM Clearing his Name for Rejoining Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Motherland Party (ANAP) leader
Mesut Yilmaz, who was accused of abusing power during his tenure as
the prime minister of Turkey, is trying hard to clear his name for
rejoining the government, Turkish Daily News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who had been prime minister from June 1997 to November
1998, refrained from playing a role in the current cabinet last May
when his ANAP allied with the Democratic Left Party (DSP) and the
Nationalist Action Party (MHP) to establish the coalition
government, led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Yilmaz preferred to stay aside, waiting for the
outcome of the parliamentary investigation against him on charge of
abusing power during the privatization process of Turkbank and
other projects.
</P>
<P>
But Yilmaz lately changed his mind and wanted to seek a post
within the government that is most likely to be reshuffled
following Ahmet Sezer's election as the next president on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who is currently being interrogated by eight separate
parliamentary investigation commissions established to conduct
inquiries against him, claimed that all the allegations "are
politically motivated."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the eight commissions neither completed their
inquiries against Yilmaz nor submitted their motions for debate in
the parliament that is dominated by ruling deputies.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to ANAP, Yilmaz may be appointed
deputy prime minister as well as minister of state in charge of
European Union Affairs, replacing ANAP's Mehmet Irtemcelik who
resigned recently, protesting against the way of the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a source close to Ecevit said,"If Yilmaz insists on
taking Ismail Cem's post as foreign minister, Ecevit may accept
this to avoid a possible collapse within the government."
</P>
<P>
Cem decided at the last minute on Wednesday not to take part in
a ministerial meeting of the Western European Union (WEU) due to be
held in Portugal on May 15-16.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry gave no reasons for his sudden decision,
despite the fact that the issue of European security to be
discussed at the meeting is very important for Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister was reported to have preferred to stay in
Ankara in case there is a cabinet reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> Iran Favors Friendly Ties with Caspian Sea Neighbors: Khatami </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said on Thursday Iran is willing to keep friendly relations with
the Caspian Sea littoral states so that the countries can cooperate
in developing and utilizing the oil resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
Iran likes to extend hands of friendship to the Caspian Sea
countries so that in line with an equitable and just framework and
firm accords, the region will remain at the disposal of its real
owners, Khatami was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony of students at the Imam
Khomeini Naval Academy in Noshahr, Mazandaran Province, the
president said that the Caspian Sea belongs to all the five
littoral states, namely Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
No foreign country should be allowed to enter the region and
intervene in regional affairs, Khatami stressed, adding all the
Caspian Sea littoral states should be able to utilize its resources
equitably and make efforts to preserve its environment.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to cooperate with all the Caspian Sea littoral
states to preserve peace and security of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea is rich in oil resources, and Iran maintains
that littoral states should reach an appropriate legal regime
without foreign intervention so that regional countries can
cooperate in developing and utilizing the reserves.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Further Lowering of Inflation Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"By June or July, if prices remain stable, we might bring down
inflation target further," said Director General Felipe Medalla of
the National Economic and Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
He said in a radio interview that prices of basic commodities
have remained stable in the past months despite adjustments in the
world prices of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
In March, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (
OPEC)decided to increase their production to ease the pressure on
fuel prices worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Philippine President Joseph Estrada urged oil firms
to lower the prices of their products sooner than planned
following the OPEC decision.
</P>
<P>
These developments, along with the economy's strong
fundamentals,allowed the government to bring down its initial
inflation target of six to seven percent for 2000 to only five to
six percent, Medalla said.
</P>
<P>
"If the current trend continues, we may be able to bring this
down below five percent. We just hope there will be no more major
increases in the prices of crude oil in the world market or any
calamity that will adversely affect the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president said his administration's efforts to
open up the economy as well as its focus on food security through
agricultural modernization are now paying off in terms of low
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Predicts Drop in Unemployment, Growth in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on Thursday predicted that his country is heading for a big drop
in unemployment amid continued strong economic growth by 2002,
Deutsche Presse-Argentur (DPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt -- there is a powerful economic upswing
in Germany," Schroeder was quoted as saying in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the German economy is expected to grow by 2.8
percent this year and in 2001.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of Germany's jobless workers would fall to 3.
5 million by the next general election in 2002. The unemployment
rate dropped to 9.8 percent, or 3.9 million in number, in April,
compared to 10.6 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder last week mentioned wanting to get unemployment below
3.5 million but this marks the first time he has set a concrete
jobs target for his planned reelection bid.
</P>
<P>
The German leader has long told voters they should toss him out
of office if he failed to trim unemployment during his four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
Stepping up his almost daily campaign to defend the euro,
Schroeder told parliament that the economic fundamentals in
Germany and the 10 other nations comprising the single currency
bloc are sound.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that German inflation remained low despite the
fact the euro has lost some 24 percent of its value against the U.
S. dollar since being launched on January 1, 1999. German
inflation in April was 1.5 percent.

<P>
The euro was trading at 0.9060 dollars on Thursday, up from its
all-time low of 0.8853 dollars set on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder called for an end to what he termed "scare-mongering"
about the euro's value and stressed that it is important to remind
the German public that the weak euro had boosted exports which
were responsible for one-third of all German jobs.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's rosy views were rejected by the main opposition
Christian Democratic alliance (CDU/CSU), said the DPA.
</P>
<P>
CDU/CSU parliamentary leader Friedrich Merz said Germany's
unemployment decline was purely due to demographic factors and
that no new jobs were being created.
</P>
<P>
"Your whole hope is that old workers will become pensioners and
the young do not become workers," said Merz, adding that Schroeder
had failed to forge a modern economic policy which would allow
Germany to better compete with the United States.
</P>
<P>
CDU/CSU economic policy spokesman, Gunnar Uldall, said in a
Phoenix TV interview that 200,000 more people per year were
leaving the German workforce through retirement than the number of
young workers entering the employment pool.
</P>
<P>
Despite his criticism, Merz said the CDU/CSU is willing to work
with Schroeder's government in hammering out a tax reform
compromise. The CDU/CSU can block elements of tax policy through
its domination of parliament's upper chamber, the Bundesrat.

fertilizer worth some 60 million U.S. dollars provided by South
Korea, said South Korean National Red Cross on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the South Korean Red Cross through the inter-

The DPRK Red Cross Society said it hoped that the fertilizer
will be shipped to five DPRK ports -- Nampo, Haeju, Wonsan,
Hungnam and Chongjin.

Pyongyang will ensure the safety of all South Korean persons
and ships going to the DPRK for the delivery of the donation and
provide them with the necessary conveniences, said the letter.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Sierra Leone's fragile cease-fire ended Wednesday as
truckloads of heavily armed pro-government militia forces rushed
to fight rebels moving toward Freetown, the capital, jamming roads
already clogged with thousands of terrified refugees trying to
escape the fighting.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Coast Guard boarded a Russian-manned fishing ship
this week and is preparing to seize it in a stepped-up campaign
against the illegal use of drift nets on the high seas, a step
that environmentalists have long sought.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's marital problems exploded
Wednesday in a public exchange with his wife, Donna Hanover. The
mayor abruptly announced that he was seeking a separation from
Hanover, and Hanover, caught unaware, then said that the couple's
troubles began years ago because of a previous relationship
between the mayor and a member of his staff.
</P>
<P>
-- Russian President Vladimir Putin named as prime minister
Wednesday a chief foreign-debt negotiator and a liberal economics
expert. The long predicted move, some experts said, bodes well for
efforts to tame Russia's feral style of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Microsoft assailed the government's proposal to break
up the company, asking a federal judge to throw it out because it
reached far beyond the evidence in the antitrust trial and could
jeopardize the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine army Wednesday pulled back troops around
rebel camps to open the way for talks with Muslim separatists
holding 21 Western and Asian hostages. The rebels are expected to
present their demands this week.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China's Township Enterprises Expect A New Round of Booming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Ministry of
Agriculture said that it has become a necessity for China's
township enterprises to undergo a new round of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Wang Baoping, head of the department of industrial policy
guidance under the ministry, pointed out that the development
speed of township enterprises has slowed down in recent years due
to some internal problems and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the official also praised the important role
township enterprises have played in promoting the rapid
development of China's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Wang said at the ongoing China (Beijing) International High-
tech Industries Week 2000 that it is a must for rural enterprises
to undertake the adjustment of industrial structure because they
have many shortcomings such as irrational product mix, small scale
of production, out-of-date technologies, and backward management.
</P>
<P>
Experts have noted that the township enterprises scored rapid
development in the early years because they enjoyed a series of
advantages in terms of market, policy, management mechanism,
resources, and labor force.
</P>
<P>
However, they said, the medium and low-grade products turned
out by the rural enterprises have lost much of their original
market in recent years due to the weakening of these advantages.
Township enterprises must adjust their industrial structure to
find a way out, they said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the Chinese government expects to further increase
the competitiveness of township enterprises on both the domestic
and international markets through the adjustment of industrial
structure.
</P>
<P>
China's rural enterprises entered a period of rapid development
in the early 1980s, with businesses including agriculture,
industry, and services.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that through adjustment, a group of township
enterprise-owned high-tech production bases are expected to be
built in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Shanghai,
and Guangdong in China's coastal area. Township enterprises in
western China are expected to build their own pillar industries
based on their respective resource advantages.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's plan, township enterprise zones
will be formed in the future, and in these zones township
enterprises will have their own chain-like co-ordination in
production, supply, and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Wang said these zones are expected to produce some 80 percent of
the business income of township enterprises by the year 2015. (

<TEXT>
<P>
He said township enterprises will focus on the development of
high-tech, high value-added, name brand, and characteristic
products in the coming years. Such products will account for 45
percent by 2015, and the number of rural enterprises boasting an
annual export value of more than one million U.S. dollars will
reach 60,000.
</P>
<P>
Randall Worsley, a representative of the Pacific Venture
Capital Company of the U.S., said that many U.S. investors are
interested in China's small and medium-sized enterprises, and they
appreciate the flexible management mechanism of them, which mainly
manufacture products that sell well.
</P>
<P>
Worsley, who is attending the ongoing high-tech week, also
expressed his willingness to invest in China's township
enterprises which are engaged in high-tech development and
production, such as agricultural technology, software, and e-
information.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "China's township enterprises will
become part of the world economy and an international economic
force."
</P>
<P>
The township enterprises have become the principle part of
China's small and medium-sized enterprises. In 1999, the
industrial added value realized by township enterprises stood at 1.
737 trillion yuan (209.2 billion U.S. dollars), or 50 percent of
the country's total, and export value totaled 774.4 billion yuan (
93.3 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 40 percent of the
national total.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises have also become a leading driving force
behind China's rural economy. Statistics show that in 1999, China
had 20.71 million township enterprises employing more than 120
million rural workers. These enterprises had a combined added
value of over 2.48 trillion yuan (298.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has worked out a series of policies and
regulations, including the Law on Township Enterprises issued in
1997, to encourage and support the development of rural
enterprises. At the same time, concerned departments have launched
special information networks and websites to serve the township
enterprises in terms of policy, circulation, and e-commerce
information.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that China's township enterprises now face a
good opportunity for development, citing rural and agricultural
structural adjustment and the development of the country's western
region, the two key state strategies at present.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle Ensures Taiwan Compatriots' Fundamental Interests: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The May Issue of the "Cross-Straits
Relations" magazine publishes a signed article making it clear
that only if the two sides of the Taiwan Straits jointly adhere to
the One-China Principle, can cross-straits ties enjoy stability
and a peaceful future.
</P>
<P>
For decades, people in China's mainland and Taiwan have lived
under different political systems, and thus held different views
on some political issues, but it has never blocked Chinese
compatriots living on the two sides of the straits from sharing a
common goal of pursuing reunification and the One-China Principle.
</P>
<P>
The article accuses Lee Teng-hui for advocating "Taiwan
independence" and attempting to split the Chinese people living on
the two sides. Lee's activities are detrimental to the fundamental
interests of the Taiwan compatriots and may even destroy the
future of Taiwan, it says.
</P>
<P>
It also accuses some political figures in Taiwan for refusing
to recognize the fact that Taiwan is part of China, urging the new
leader of Taiwan to officially recognize the One-China Principle
and that Taiwan is part of China, so as to prevent "Taiwan
independence".
</P>
<P>
The article urges the new leader of Taiwan not to take the road
of Lee Teng-hui who has marred the cross-straits relations. If the
new leader recognizes the One-China Principle, the two sides can
restore mutual political trust and further strengthen cross-
straits economic cooperation, and finally end hostility through
negotiations, it says.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the mainland has adopted a practical
attitude toward the One-China Principle, but some people in Taiwan
are doing all they can to undermine the sincerity of the mainland
in realizing reunification.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Concern Over Trial of Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday once again rejected
concern expressed by the United States officials on the ongoing
trial of the 13 Iranian Jews on charges of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on Thursday
that the recent remarks of U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the issue
is a "blatant intervention in Iran's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Gore on Tuesday voiced concern over the trial and said that the
Iranian Jews were detained without a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities assured the international community that
due process would be served, but by denying access to international
observers and the press, the Iranian government has cast grave
doubts on the legitimacy of the proceedings and on the recent
statements of the accused, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Gore's remarks, Asefi said that Iran's judiciary would
handle the case with full independence and irrespective of others'
statements, and would treat the accused in full justice.
</P>
<P>
"Repeated and intervening statements of the U.S. officials is
surprising and indicates their ignorance of the process of
investigation of the suspects' case," he said, quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iran's judicial officials said three of the 13 Iranian Jews have
confessed to spying for Israel during the closed-door court
hearings at the Islamic revolutionary court in Shiraz, Fars
province, the center of the 25,000-strong Jewish community in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The trial has aroused concern in the West, and the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has warned the outcome could
have international repercussions.

<HEADLINE> New Steps Taken to Fund War Against Tamil Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Finance Gamini Peiris told the parliament
that the government planned to issue some 10 billion rupees (135
million U.S. dollars) worth of additional treasury bills this year.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said the government also planned to raise the national
security levy by one percentage point to 6.5 percent, fetching an
additional 2.5 billion rupees (33.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The government will raise the money ensuring there is no
impact on inflation," Peiris said, adding that the government
would ensure its budget deficit did not exceed eight percent of
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's deficit was 7.5 percent of GDP last year, lower
than the 9.2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Peiris said the government's decision last week to stop all non-
essential development activities would save it another 6 billion
rupees (81 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the government announced that it has raised the
taxes on cigarettes and liquor to bring in 1.5 billion rupees (20.
24 million dollars) for the war chest.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government was committed to a political
solution to the civil war which has plagued the country since 1983,
but it presently had little choice but to fight the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
Government troops, who have pledged never to give up Jaffna,
are engaged in fierce battles against the LTTE in northern Jaffna
peninsula where the rebels are trying to recapture their former
stronghold.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Higher Revenue in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it registered a revenue over-performance of 4.568
billion pesos(114.2 million U.S. dollars) for the first quarter of
2000 mainly due to the country's growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Leonor Briones said in a statement that the total
revenues of the national government for the quarter was 114.533
billion pesos (2.86 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
This amount consisted of collections by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, the Bureau of Customs, the Bureau of Treasury and other
government offices, said Briones.
</P>
<P>
Briones attributed the over-performance to the growing economy
of the country and the high efficiency in tax collection. She also
said there is a higher level of commitment among the tax
collectors now.
</P>
<P>
"But even though the national government cash operations have
come up with this over-performance, the country is not yet free
from debt,"she noted.
</P>
<P>
Briones said the Philippines has an accumulated debt of 1.7
trillion pesos (42.5 billion dollars) so far. She stressed that
they will first consider paying the interest on the domestic debt
with the available money now.
</P>
<P>
She said the Bureau of the Treasury is also planning to review
the borrowing program of the national government in June in order
to be sure of its efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Filipino Student May Accidentally Spread "Love Bug" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A Filipino computer student told
reporters Thursday that he may have accidentally released the "I
Love You" computer virus into cyberspace that caused massive
damage around the world.
</P>
<P>
Onel de Guzman, a dropout from AMA computer school, didn't say
directly whether he had written the computer virus. He only said "
it is possible" that he had released the bug.
</P>
<P>
Guzman's lawyer Rolando Quimbo said the young man "is not
really aware that the act imputed to him was done by him", adding
that no crime had been committed if no law had been violated.
</P>
<P>
The "Love Bug" began to sweep around the world since last
Thursday and destroyed e-mail programs of millions of computers.
Experts said damage from the bug and its variants has been
estimated at 7 billion U.S. dollars, and could reach 10 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
An official from the AMA computer school said Onel de Guzman
had excelled in his computer courses, but dropped out after his
thesis proposal was rejected as unethical.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the "Love Bug" was similar to Onel de Guzman's
thesis, called E-mail Passward Sender Trojan, which was designed
to obtain Windows passwords, and retrieve Internet accounts from
victims' computers.
</P>
<P>
Philippine police turned their investigation on the computer
school after receiving 10 coded names, embedded in the "I Love You
" virus,from U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agent
</P>
<P>
The police said Onel de Guzman's sister Irene de Guzman owned
the Manila apartment that was searched by Philippine police on
Monday as they tried to locate the computer that caused the havoc.
</P>
<P>
They seized a box with 17 items during the search but failed to

find the computer they believe had been used to originate the
virus.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Philippine authorities also detained Irene de Guzman
's boyfriend, Reomel Ramones, but later released him. Ramones is
expected to answer charges on May 10.

tourism with 50 percent of foreign tour groups cancelling trips to
the region, the party's tourism spokeswoman Janet Semple said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party believes that SADC should begin an
all-out initiative to reassure tourists that the region is safe,
secure and provides good value for money. Tourism is a vital part
of the region's lifeblood and simply can not be allowed to fall
apart because of the conflict in Zimbabwe," she said.
</P>
<P>
Semple said several tour operators have reported cancellations
by large international tour groups which always use South Africa
as a springboard for travelling to other countries in the SADC
region.
</P>
<P>
Political violence has escalated in Zimbabwe in the run-up to
parliamentary elections and black war veterans have invaded more
than 1000 white-owned farms to demand redistribution of land.

<HEADLINE> Information Crucial for Development of Western China: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Information should be given top
priority as the Chinese government develops the western part of
the country, said Wu Jiapei, an eminent economist and head
scientist at the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the world is now changing from an industrial era
to an information era. It is necessary for the impoverished
western part of China to become information competent.
</P>
<P>
Wu is one of pioneers of quantitative and information economics
in China and is considered as one of most influential experts in
the field. His research has guided important government policies.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by the World Bank, the gap between
developed countries and developing countries is essentially one
concerning information.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that local and central governments must work harder in
carrying out polices. He suggested that the government do
something developing and promoting the information industry in
China's western regions as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Wu expects that China's western regions will be able to catch
up with global information trends, and upgrade their information
industry to promote social and economic development.

BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Dalai Lama is a political figure in

<HEADLINE> Senior CPC Official Meets Indonesian Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, met here today with a delegation
of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (IDPS) headed by
its former General Secretary Alexander Litaay.
</P>
<P>
This is not only the first IDPS delegation to visit China, but
also the first delegation from any Indonesian party to visit China
in years.
</P>
<P>
Wei, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee, hailed the traditional friendship between the two
countries, adding that China and Indonesia have both contributed
to the unity of people in Asia and Africa and their struggle for
national independence and against imperialism and colonialism.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that bilateral relations have achieved overall
development in political, economic, military and cultural fields
since the two countries formally resumed diplomatic ties. He also
mentioned President Abdurrahman Wahid's successful visit to China
last year.
</P>
<P>
It is in the interests of both peoples and for the benefit of
peace and stability in the region and the world as a whole that
both countries further their friendship and relations of
cooperation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese government appreciates Indonesia's
correct position on the issues of Taiwan and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of party-to-party relations, Wei said that the CPC
hopes to carry out extensive and in-depth exchanges and
cooperation with the IDPS on the basis of principles including
independence, absolute equality, mutual respect, and non-
interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Further exchanges and cooperation between the two parties will
not only enhance understanding and friendship between both parties
and both peoples, but help promote the healthy development of
bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Litaay said that IDPS President Megawati Soekarno
Putri, also vice-president of Indonesia, actively promotes the
friendly exchanges with the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The development of party-to-party relations helps exchange
experience on how to run a country, and is conducive to the
progress of state-to-state ties, and the peace and stability of
the region and the world, he added.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here at the invitation of the CPC.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Refutes Pro-Falun Gong Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua today published an article
refuting a lengthy pro-Falun Gong thesis which was published in a
recent issue of a US-based Chinese-language newspaper, and signed
"Some Falun Gong practitioners from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences."
</P>
<P>
Wang Yusheng, author of the Xinhua article titled "It Is Not
Science But A Real Superstition," repudiated the pro-Falun Gong
thesis, which was titled "It Is Not Superstition But A Broad And
Intensive Science."
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out in his article that there are many mistakes in
the lengthy thesis, though it looks like an "academic paper." The
thesis was published by "stealing the name of scientists" to
fabricate a "scientific" basis for the cult, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang criticized the pro-Falun Gong thesis by using a large
number of scientific facts and theories of modern sciences.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the thesis denies astronomy by advocating Li Hongzhi,
the cult leader of Falun Gong, who boasts that he is the supreme
master of the entire cosmos.
</P>
<P>
The Xinhua article also refuted Li Hongzhi for his claim that
he is able to postpone the explosion of the Earth by 30 years. As
it takes billions of years for celestial bodies to develop, Li was
talking like an idiot, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article also refuted some ridiculous views held by Li
Hongzhi on the "cosmic explosion" and evolutionism.
</P>
<P>
The thesis described Falun Gong as "scientific" but it could
not give scientific reasons, according to Wang's article. He asked
that if all paralyzed patients could recover through practicing
Falun Gong, Li Hongzhi should have quit as a cult leader and
opened a hospital specialized in treating the paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 people have died practicing Falun Gong, which
indicates the enormous harm of the cult, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Wang criticized the thesis for its distortion of the
development of science in ancient China and its support of Li's
theory that people can become aware of the cosmos through
practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Cults are a new type of terrorism, and the most serious harm to
people's political and spiritual rights, and is the most serious
blasphemy to the civilization of mankind, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the mass media to make just decisions and never be
used as a mouthpiece for cults.

<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China encourages foreign
pharmaceutical companies to expand their business from

Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
"We support transnational corporations to set up R&AMP;D centers in
China, and develop new products together with domestic institutes
and hospitals," said Yu Mingde, director of Pharmaceutical
Department under the National Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign-funded research centers will be exempt
from import tariff and custom taxes. Facilities should be made in
China and the cost should be included in the total investment.
</P>
<P>
Business taxes will also be exempted if foreign companies
transferred technology to the Chinese side, the official said at
the Fourth Beijing Biotech and Pharmaceutical Industry Development
Forum.
</P>
<P>
Yu's department is responsible for macro adjustment and control
of China's giant pharmaceutical industry. Basic guidelines for
foreign investment in the sector includes developing new products,
new technology and exports.
</P>
<P>
He also encouraged overseas companies to start business in the
central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
"The success of Xi'an-Janssen Pharmaceutical Ltd. has proved
that foreign companies have enormous room to develop if they carry
out correct strategies," Yu said.

</P>
<P>
The United Nations held the conference, the largest of its kind,

Action were passed at that time to promote the development of
women throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
China, along with other countries, has been trying to put the

China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
She said at today's meeting that the Chinese government has
worked out the principles and guidelines for women's development

CAIRO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.

<P>
SANAA -- An official of the Yemeni central bank said the bank's
reserves of foreign currencies have increased by 33 percent since
the beginning of this year to reach more than 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is compared to 1.4 billion dollars at the end of last year
and 981 million dollars at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni official attributed the increase to the economic
reform programs launched in the country in 1995 under the
supervision of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The reforms included the cancellation of some subsidized
foodstuff, raising fuel prices and reducing public spending.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish government has issued a decree aimed at
supporting animal breeding over a five-year period from 2000 to
2004.

According to the decree published in Official Gazette Wednesday,
funds will be earmarked from budgetary allocations for animal
breeding and will be extended through Ziraat Bank, which will
receive a 1 percent service commission.
</P>
<P>
The practice is subject to Treasury and Ziraad Bank approval and
will be finalized in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Nigerian Communication Minister Alhaji Mohammed Arzika

</P>
<P>
Arzika, who was in Turkey for the World Radio-communication
Conference in Ankara, told Oksuz Wednesday that Nigeria welcomes
Turkish companies to join bids in telecommunication, transportation
projects and operation of ports and other facilities in his West
African country.

Oksuz said that Turkey can purchase oil and natural gas from
Nigeria and stressed that the trade volume between the two
countries should be increased.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices nose-dived to a new
low on Singapore Stock Market Thursday as a steep decline in the U.
S. equity market overnight took its toll on local chips broadly.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) plunged by 53.28 points
to close at 2,003.72, nearly falling through the 2,000-point level.
</P>
<P>
The total volume expanded to 507.13 million shares valued at
591.53 million Singapore dollars (342.74 million U.S. dollars).
Declining issues outstripped advancers by 267 to 62 with 210
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
CEI topped the volume list as it registered a turnover of 47.26
million units. Chew EuHock clinched the position as the second
most heavily traded stock with a turnover of 44.81 million units.
JurTech was next with 32.21 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
CenProp was the biggest gainer of the day, surging up 200 cents
to close at 14 Singapore dollars. Chew EuHock edged up 5 cents to
finish at 0.75 Singapore dollars. Eagle inched up 4 cents to end
at 0.395 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Blue chips of DBS, SIA 200 and SPH 100 led losers of the day,
diving 90 cents each to close at 20.2, 16.7 and 29.1 Singapore
dollars respectively. SIA sank 80 cents to finish at 16.7
Singapore dollars while PacCent shed 70 percent to end at 12.8
Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Feature: India Greets 1 Billionth Baby With Family Planning Message by Zhou Xiaozheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Photographers and TV cameramen
fought one another for a position near her, officials and doctors
shouted "order" to protect her, and ministers were trying to
present a bouquet to her ..., but she remained unmoved and was
just enjoying a sweet nap in her mother's arms.
</P>
<P>
This was the public debut of India's 1 billionth baby, born at
5:05 Thursday morning in New Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, the
country's largest public hospital, and officially anointed in the
afternoon by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the
U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
Weighing 3.1 kilograms at birth, the baby girl was given the
name Astha, which literally means hope and reliance in Hindi, by
her parents, Ashok and Anjana.
</P>
<P>
Ashok, around 30, was a clerk in a small car accessories shop
with a monthly income of some 2,100 rupees (48.8 U.S. dollars),
while Anjana, 24, wasn't working. Astha is the second child of the
couple, who have already a four-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
In a strict sense, Astha might not be eligible for the title of
India's Citizen One Billion, as it was projected by the Registrar
General of India in 1995 that the subcontinental country's
population would cross the 1 billion mark at 12:56 p.m. Thursday.
Both the Health and Family Welfare Ministry and the UNFPA
acknowledged, however, that the selection of the girl was just a
symbolic act.
</P>
<P>
"It was humanly impossible to pinpoint the exact 1 billionth
baby in such a vast country like India and the selection could
only be symbolic," said M. D. Ghosh, joint secretary of family
welfare. Every minute 52 babies are born in India.
</P>
<P>
While Astha is "very special and unique" as the Chosen One,
some 70,000 other babies born across India Thursday and every day
are also important, said Michael Vlassoff, UNFPA representative in
India, at a function hosted in the Outpatients Department of
Safdarjung Hospital Thursday afternoon to mark Baby One Billion.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the journalists who appeared to be overexcited at the
baby, officials present at the function, mostly from the Health
and Family Welfare Ministry, carried a solemn complexion and
rarely showed a smile.
</P>
<P>
"We are neither celebrating it nor condemning it (the birth of
the 1 billionth baby), we're just marking it," said M. D. Ghosh.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that India now supports 16 percent of the world
's population on only 2.4 percent of the global land area, and the
size of India's population keeps expanding by some 15.5 million
each year. Some demographers predicted that India would overtake
China to become the world's most populous country in the mid-21st
century with a population of some 1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
In a display of the central government's worry about the
population situation and its emphasis on curbing the population
growth, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also expected to
deliver a population message to the nation through TV and radio
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the function in the hospital Thursday afternoon, Minister of
State for Health and Family Welfare N. T. Shanmugham launched the
National Population Policy 2000 recently adopted by the Indian
cabinet on the website of his ministry and formally announced the
establishment of a National Population Commission here.
</P>
<P>
Headed by Vajpayee, the commission will be in charge of
reviewing the implementation of family welfare programs across the
country and coordinating various reproductive health programs.
</P>
<P>
The most delivered message of the day, however, was the "small
family norm" which the Indian government started to promote across
the country in the 1980s. While the norm suggests that each family
of the country have no more than two children, a 1993 official
survey found that the average number of children born to an Indian
family in urban and rural areas was 2.67 and 2.96 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"For us May 11 provides an opportunity which we shall use to
drive home the message of the small family norm. Every person
should know he or she has a choice available," A. R. Nanda,
secretary of family welfare, said here several days ago.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, officials from the ministry had spent several
weeks preparing for the Thursday hospital function, with most of
their efforts devoted to the search for the "most appropriate"
baby, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of the baby hunt, the
ministry had certain criteria for the "right one," who was
expected to be able to help the government convey its population
messages with the best results.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the basic condition of being born on May 11, the
ministry also preferred it to be the first or at least second
child born to a family of the lower income group, which was
believed to suffer most from the population problem yet also
contribute most to the population increase, said the official.
</P>
<P>
It was also the ministry's wish that the baby was female, which
would help beat the obsolete but persistent concept of sex
discrimination, the official added.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, "the day of the billion"
would also be marked with a series of other functions and seminars
in the Indian capital focusing on issues of population
stabilization, reproductive and child health, gender equity and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Even those ministries which seemed to have nothing to do with
population were engaged in Thursday's publicity campaign: The
Department of Posts issued a stamp and a first-day cover marking
the day, the Finance Ministry decided to mint new five-rupee coins
with a small family message, and the Ministry of Railways agreed
to print a short message on all tickets telling the people to keep
their families small.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for reflection. The situation is grim but if we
behave responsibly we can overcome. But if we delay, things can go
beyond control," A. R. Nanda was quoted as saying to the local
press earlier.
</P>
<P>
And some of those present at Thursday's function in Safdarjung
Hospital had already seen a sign of hope for India's population
prospects as the baby girl's father, in response to a reporter's
question, said: "We will have no more child."

<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An Abu Sayyaf commander Thursday
asked for 200 million pesos (5 million U.S. dollars) from the
Philippine government to effect the release of the 21 hostages
still in their hands.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf Commander Galip Andang said that there will be no
release of hostages unless the ransom of 200 million pesos is
produced by the government with the help of the mother countries
of the foreign hostages.

French Steponie Loisy is afflicted with urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>

a decision.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, three Germans, two French, two Finns, two
South Africans, one Lebanese and 11 Asians, were taken from a
Malaysian diving resort on April 23 and moved to the Philippine
island of Jolo.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Police Vow to Punish Trouble-Makers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The general commander of the
Mozambican police, Pascoal Ronda, said that all those involved in
the attack on the police station in Aube, in the northern province
of Nampula, on May 5, will be criminally charged, Thursday's
Noticias newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Ronda said that this is a crime that merits the full weight of
the law, according to which, "criminal acts should be repressed".
</P>
<P>
"When the electoral process ended, we urged people not to drag
others to the abyss, so as to prevent dangerous situations", he
said, adding that " our duty, as police officers, is to prevent
criminal acts, urge people to act with good sense and not tolerate
problems that endanger people's lives".
</P>
<P>
He said that public order has been restored in Aube, and urged
the residents to keep the law and not endanger order and security.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Renamo delegate in Aube, and the Angoche
District Renamo delegate, who are said to have led the attack on
the police station, are still at large and the police are looking
for them.
</P>
<P>
Those detained on the day of the raid have been transferred to
Angoche town.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nampula provincial police command, the raid
was preceded by political meetings addressed by the Renamo
district delegate, Alvaro Chale, with the participation of senior
Renamo members.
</P>
<P>
The source claimed that these meetings, which were not open to
the general public, were to prepare a program aimed at installing
parallel governments and seizing power in various parts of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the police actions concerning this situation, the
source said that "at this moment, we are strengthening operative
vigilance, not only in Aube or Morrumbala (a district where Renamo
has also stirred up civil disobedience), but in all parts of the
country, to fight any attempt to cause disorder".

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges Acceleration of Tourism Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

HEFEI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen has urged
local governments at all levels to speed up the pace of reforming
the country's fledgling tourism industry so as to promote Sino-
foreign exchanges and economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the call during his inspection tour of Anhui Province

He urged the creation of a sound environment for setting up
Sino-foreign joint venture travel services, and on-line bookings
for tourist accommodations via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Farmers should also be encouraged to enter the business by
turning their houses, farms, and orchards into tourism facilities,
or by manufacturing souvenirs, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Official Meets Iranian Ambassador over Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish Foreign Ministry
official has met with Iranian ambassador Hossein Lavasani here over
mounting allegations that Iran had been involved in a notorious
murder in Turkey years ago.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News reported Thursday that Undersecretary Faruk
Logoglu conveyed Turkey's concerns over the recent developments on
the case of Ugur Mumcu, a famous Turkish journalist who was killed
in a car bomb seven years ago, which caused Turkey-wide
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Both Iranian and Turkish diplomatic sources, however, stressed
that Lavasani was not summoned to the ministry, and that the
Wednesday meeting was a previously arranged one.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian diplomat, meanwhile, accused Israel of creating the
latest allegations against Iran, claiming that pro-Israeli circles
in Turkey were mobilized after 13 Iranian Jews confessed that they
had been spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that five of the Iranian Jews arrested one year
ago on charges of espionage for Israel have "confessed to their
crimes" although the Jewish state denied any links with them.
</P>
<P>
"Now that Iranian Jews have admitted their crimes, Israel is in
a very difficult situation," said the Iranian diplomat who was not
named, adding the allegations against Iran were "in a bid to
dynamite Turkish-Iranian relations."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli embassy in Ankara had stated that they have been
closely following developments in the Mumcu case, hoping to find a
clue to the killing of Israeli diplomat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Sadan, the Israeli diplomat, was also killed in a car bomb
in Ankara in March 1992, in the same way as Mumcu was murdered. The
case is still open.
</P>
<P>
A total of 121 people have been arrested so far during police
operations against a terrorist organization believed to be behind
the Mumcu murder.
</P>
<P>
The name of the group has appeared as "Tevhid" or "Selam" in the
press, and two Iranian diplomats have reportedly been among those
named as possibly being involved in the murder.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a suspect under interrogation claimed that Iranians had
planned and carried out the bombing while he had only watched out
for the police.
</P>
<P>
But deputy spokesman of Turkish Foreign Ministry, Sermet
Atacanli, said on Wednesday that as both the Interior Ministry and
security authorities were carrying out secret investigation, the
Foreign Ministry had not received any document or evidence for
taking any diplomatic action against Iran.

<HEADLINE> Israel Ready for Arms Control Talks With Egypt: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel is prepared to discuss with
Egypt the sensitive nuclear issue in a flexible move to defuse
mounting pressure, Ha'aretz newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Cairo on Monday, Israeli Foreign Ministry
deputy director-general Yoav Biran conveyed his country's readiness
to discuss the nuclear issue to the head of Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa's office, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
A planned meeting with Moussa on Monday, however, was cancelled
at the last minute, as Syrian President Hafez al-Assad arrived in
Egypt on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Israel, the only country in the Middle East that has not signed
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has been under great
pressure at the ongoing NPT review conference at the U.N.
headquarters in New York. Israel is not formally attending the
conference which is held from April 24 to May 19.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979 but to keep a "cold peace" with it thereafter, has focused
attention on the Jewish state and launched a campaign at the
conference to secure a special condemnation of it.
</P>
<P>
The NPT treaty "cannot have any credibility with the states of
the region as long as the state (of Israel) is exempt from its
provisions," Egypt argued.
</P>
<P>
A draft statement on the U.N. review of the NPT treaty has
reportedly singled out Israel as the only Middle East state that
has not signed the pact. Israel had wished that the conference
would conclude without issuing a final declaration.
</P>
<P>
Last week, seeing a possible U.S. move to prod his country for
not signing the NPT treaty, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy
sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
expressing deep concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the major patron of Israel in the world
political arena, has been pressuring Israel to start quiet arms
talks with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Hoping to defuse the issue, Israel has decided to show
flexibility, allowing arms talks to commence with Egypt while
maintaining its traditional guidelines of refusing to consider
disarmament before a stable peace is achieved in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Israel, estimated to have 200 to 300 nuclear warheads, the sixth
largest nuclear arsenal in the world, has said that the current
non-proliferation treaty is not the proper answer to the question
in the region, which it said was proved by the cases of Iran and
Iraq, its staunch foes.
</P>
<P>
In response to Israel's offer to hold talks on arms control,
Egyptian officials promised to pass on the message to the highest
levels of government. Moussa has also suggested that the two
nations start talks on a spectrum of issues, including economic,
security and diplomatic relations.

<HEADLINE> Rabin's Widow Suffers from Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Leah Rabin, widow of the
assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, is currently
undergoing medical tests in the United States and receiving
treatments for lung cancer, Israel Radio reported Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Rabin's family members, the report said the medical tour
was recommended by Leah's doctors in Israel, who had diagnosed her
illness as cancer.
</P>
<P>
Leah, 72, is expected to have a series of further tests in New
York to determine the treatment and will be back home by the end of
this week, according to her son-in-law Avi Pelosoff.
</P>
<P>
There is contradictory information about Leah's health
condition. The Washington Post daily reported on Wednesday that the
cancer is in an early stage, but an official in Washington said she
is apparently "very sick."
</P>
<P>
Pelosoff, however, said his mother-in-law is in high spirits,
functions totally independently, and is sure of overcoming the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Leah, according to Pelosoff, is determined to continue her work
to establish a research center for Israeli studies in the name of
her slain husband.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister from 1992 to 1995, was
murdered by a right-wing extremist in November 1995 because of his
dovish stands toward the peace process with the Palestinians, Syria
and other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
He also served an earlier term as prime minister in the 1970s,
but had to resign in 1977 after Leah's illegal foreign bank
accounts in the United States were disclosed as scandals by his
political enemies and Israeli media.

<HEADLINE> "Love Bug" Costs Israeli Companies 12 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel has been hard hid by the
computer virus known as "Love Bug" in the past week with the
estimated damages amounting to 50 million shekels (about 12.1
million U.S. dollars), a computer security supervising company
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The virus struck many Israeli companies connected to the
Internet and deleted important files on hard disks, according to a
newsletter issued by Insuretech, a company dealing with risk
management and Internet security.
</P>
<P>
Insuretech's report showed that the losses are mainly suffered
in the form of the working hours spent in finding and cleaning out
the virus and the working hours lost due to the virus. There is no
immediate report about the working hours needed for replacing
erased documents.
</P>
<P>
Ilanit Pesach, director-general of Insuretech, revealed that
Israeli companies spent tens of thousands of working hours over the
weekend in recovering from the virus.
</P>
<P>
The virus, which rapidly spread throughout Europe, Asia, and the
United States, was carried through e-mails titled "I Love You" or
with some variations
</P>
<P>
When opened, the virus will erase some files on the hard disk of
the victim's computer and access the address book, replicate
itself, and send copies to every addresses in the book.
</P>
<P>
Since last week, Israel had issued warnings to companies of the
country to minimize the spread of the virus, fearing the virus
might affect its hi-tech companies, a pillar industry in its
economy.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Worries, Hopes Mix Over India's Population Prospects  by Zhou Xiaozheng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- As India's population crossed the
1 billion mark on Thursday, officials and demographic experts here
were deeply worried by the mounting population pressure on the
environment and economy while also cherishing the hope that
intensified government efforts would help reverse the current
trends.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that India has witnessed a high population
growth throughout the past century, an embarrassing fact to this
subcontinental nation which led the world in endorsing the concept
of family planning and launched its family planning programs as
early as 1952.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 238 million in 1901, the Indian population
doubled in 60 years to 439 million by 1961 and doubled again in
the following 30 years to reach 846 million by 1991. Now it keeps
expanding at a rate of 15.5 million a year, which accounts for one-
fifth of the annual global population growth.
</P>
<P>
Although the Indian government has managed to sharply reduce
the country's birth rate to 26.4 per 1,000 in 1998 from 40.8 per 1,
000 in 1951, the country's population growth rate, which peaked at
2.22 percent between 1971 and 1981, has remained high at about 1.7
percent as against 1.58 percent in 1951.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Health and Family Welfare Ministry attributed
this mainly to the huge population base that was already in
existence, as well as the large size of the population in the
reproductive age-group, or those who have child-bearing
capabilities. The number of people in this age-group is expected
to further increase by 417.2 million between 1991 and 2016, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the officials also conceded that some other factors
had contributed to the country's high population growth, including
higher fertility due to failure in contraception, high wanted
fertility due to a high infant morality rate, and child and early
marriages which resulted in a reproductive pattern of "too early,
too frequent, too many."
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's statistics, only 44 percent of the
168 million eligible couples across India are currently
effectively protected by contraception services; the country's
infant mortality rate stands high in Asia at 72 per 1,000 births
despite a sharp decrease from 146 per 1,000 in 1951; over 50
percent of Indian girls marry below the age of 18, the minimum
legal age of marriage and around 33 percent births occur at
intervals of less than 24 months.
</P>
<P>
As India is now supporting 16 percent of the world's population
on just 2.4 percent of the global land area, the population
problem is looming as a major threat to the country's sustainable
development and a potential source of crisis in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Food, land, water, housing, education ... You will meet all
these problems with a large population," said K.V. Rao, chief
director of family welfare. "And another major problem to the
national economy is unemployment."
</P>
<P>
While the Indian government managed to offer some 106.5 million
more jobs to its people between 1983 and 1997, the country's
unemployed population surged to 7.5 million from 5.9 million in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
The population problem has also turned out to be a major
barrier to the government's ambitious goal of eliminating mass
poverty which has pestered the country for decades. Some 350
million Indians live below the poverty line, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
"One third of the Indian population were born below the poverty
line, and yet it was the lower income group of the population
which mainly contributed to the country's population growth due to
their lower education levels," said Rao.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a grim population situation and gripped by a sense
of urgency, the Indian government has shown a determination to
beef up its efforts in tackling the population problem by working
out a National Population Policy 2000, the first of its kind in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The policy, first drafted in 1997 on the 50th anniversary of
India's independence and redrafted in 1999, has recently been
approved by the Indian cabinet and placed before the Indian
Parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Highly optimistic about the approval of the document by the
parliament during its ongoing annual session, officials at the
Health and Family Welfare Ministry expressed high expectations on
what the document could do to change the current population growth
trends.
</P>
<P>
Under the policy, a National Population Commission headed by
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee will be formed to review the
implementation of the family welfare program in the country and
coordinate various reproductive health programs. Similar organs
will be established at the state level and headed by the chief
minister of the state.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the government also promises to give all
necessary financial support to relevant departments to meet the
needs for contraceptive services across the country, improve the
health infrastructure, especially that in the vast rural area, and
train more specialists and skilled personnel in health and family
planning work, so as to avoid unwanted pregnancies and sharply cut
down the infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the manpower training project alone would
cost the government some 23 billion rupees (535 million U.S.
dollars), while efforts to make up the inadequacy of the health
infrastructure would require billions of rupees more.
</P>
<P>
However, officials and experts here believe that compared with
government emphasis and guarantee of funding and resources, the
more important things to do are to enhance family planning
education and improve the people's population awareness, because
all family planning programs and initiatives in India are supposed
to be carried out on a completely voluntary basis.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian government believes there should be no coercion or
compulsion in the administration of the family planning program,"
claimed M. D. Ghosh, joint secretary of family welfare.
</P>
<P>
There are two major family planning concepts which the Indian
government has striven for decades to persuade its people to
accept: The idea that "all girls should not get married before 18
and have children before 20" and the so-called "small family norm"
which suggests that each family have no more than two children.
</P>
<P>
While some progress has been made in spreading these concepts
across the country, especially in states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra
Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh where the local governments attached
great importance to family planning, the overall situation remains
far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Despite a law specially enacted in 1974 to prohibit it, child
marriage is rampant in rural areas where around 74 percent of the
population live. A 1993 official survey found that the average
number of children born to an urban family and a rural one was 2.
67 and 2.96 respectively.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to promote delayed marriages and the small family
norm more rapidly and effectively, the National Population Policy
2000 provides a number of incentives including cash award and
health insurance for those who would accept the concepts.
</P>
<P>
As listed out in the document, a cash incentive of 500 rupees (
11.6 dollars) would be awarded to mothers who have their first
child after 19, but only for the birth of the first or second
child; and couples below the poverty line who agree to undergo
sterilization with no more than two living children, would also
become eligible, along with their children, to health insurance up
to 5,000 rupees (116.3 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The policy also tries to encourage Panchayats, the self-
governance body in Indian villages, to work hard in spreading the
small family norm, achieving reductions in infant mortality and
birth rates and promoting literacy at the grassroots level,
claiming that those with "exemplary performance" would be "
rewarded and honored."
</P>
<P>
Many officials and experts here saw a light of hope with the
introduction of the National Population Policy 2000 and predicted
that the document would help greatly ease the country's population
pressure.
</P>
<P>
One clear goal the policy sets for India's family planning
efforts is to bring down the national average level of total
fertility rate, or the number of children a woman bears in her
lifetime, to 2.1 by 2010 from the current level of 3.3.
</P>
<P>
If this goal is achieved, India's population growth rate might
be cut to some 1.1 to 1.2 percent by 2010, and the population then
would be 1.107 billion, officials predicted.
</P>
<P>
A major newspaper in Delhi also forecast on Wednesday that with
the policy at work, India's population by 2045 could be kept at 1.
3 billion instead of the earlier projected figure of 1.5 billion,
which would prevent India from overtaking China to become the
world's most populous country as predicted by many demographers.
</P>
<P>
Cautious officials at the Health and Family Welfare Ministry
avoided direct comment on this bold prediction, but they hinted
that they might share the newspaper's view.
</P>
<P>
"With this policy and a serious and consistent implementation
of it, we do hope to increase the decline of our population growth,
" M. D. Ghosh stressed.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Help Indonesia in Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- World Bank Country Director in
Indonesia Mark Baird said here Thursday that in the next few years
the bank's programs in the country will be focused on poverty
reduction efforts.
</P>
<P>
"In subsequent years, as the economy recovers and the fiscal
position improves, our general budget support will be phased out.
Instead, we will shift back toward financing development programs
focused on poverty reduction," Baird said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that three main aspects play an important role in any
poverty reduction strategy, namely economic recovery and sustained
growth, equal opportunity and access for the poor and good
governance and anti-corruption efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Worldwide experience teaches us that sustained growth is
essential for sustained poverty reduction," Baird said.
</P>
<P>
"Even with stronger growth, there is no guarantee that the poor
will be able to take full advantage of the new opportunities for
employment and income generation. They need access to basic
education and health services, as well as basic infrastructure
such as water, sanitation and roads," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the poor need to be empowered and given a voice"so
that they can have a say in their own development programs."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has been active in Indonesia since 1967 and has
financed 25 billion U.S. dollars worth of development projects and
programs in all sectors of the economy.

NEW DELHI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Forty Pakistani fishermen, aboard
three fishing boats, were arrested by Indian coast guards from
Indian territorial waters off the Gulf of Kutch, coast guards said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The coast guards kept vigil following complaints by Indian
fishermen about being beaten and looting of fish by Pakistani
fishermen, who they alleged intruded into Indian waters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During their patrol, the coast guards intercepted the three
Pakistani boats. The 40 Pakistani fishermen, along with their
boats, were brought to Okha port in West India Thursday for
interrogation, according to the Press Trust of India.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Indonesia to Reform Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needs a fundamental
reform in its civil service to back its efforts for curbing
rampant corruption, collusion and nepotistic practices in the
country, the World Bank said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference on "Grand Strategy for Indonesia's
Economic Recovery," World Bank Country Director in Indonesia Mark
Baird said,"Although there are no hard numbers, it is widely
accepted that corruption, collusion and nepotism became rampant
during the latter years of Soeharto's regime. This seriously
undermined the effectiveness of the government's development
programs."
</P>
<P>
"The new government is committed to fighting corruption. But
progress has been painfully slow," he said. "It is widely
recognized that the judicial reform is at the heart of any
governance agenda. This is essential to restore confidence in the
courts, so that contracts can be enforced and those involved in
corruption can be held responsible.There is also need for
fundamental reforms in the civil service."
</P>
<P>
He added that higher salaries for civil servants alone will not
reduce corruption without accountability.
</P>
<P>
The government of Indonesia in the current fiscal year managed
to increase salaries of civil servants and military officers as
well, in its bid to reduce corruption practices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, commenting on the government plans to impose a
decentralization program under which local governments will have
more authorities, Baird said the program needs to be managed
carefully.
</P>
<P>
"The decentralization program needs to be managed carefully and
local governments need to gear up quickly to handle their new
responsibilities -- not doing so will increase the risk that the
quality of service delivery will actually decline," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The procurement system and financial management need to be
strengthened at all levels of governments," Baird said, noting
that not all of these activities require lending from the bank.
</P>
<P>
Baird pointed out that the best way to control corruption is to
ensure broader participation in project designs, implementation
and monitoring.

<HEADLINE> Prince Ranariddh Pledges Unity of 2 Main Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh pledged Thursday that his party,
FUNCINPEC, and the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), the two ruling
parties in the country, will unite and cooperate with each other.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability is the cornerstone of economic development,
"the prince emphasized at the two-day Cambodia Investment 2000
Conference, adding, "Both parties recognize the importance of
national reconciliation and pledge to work closely together to
improve the living standard of our long-suffering people."
</P>
<P>
More than 220 investors and interested parties are attending
the conference co-sponsored by the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council and
Dataconsult. Participants include international powerhouses like
Citibank, Lockheed Martin, Chevron and Caltex.
</P>
<P>
Investors will hear from the government about the business
climate in Cambodia and take a look around to make preliminary
assessments of the business potential here.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the participants on the political and economic
situation in the country,Ranariddh said, "In my capacity as
president of FUNCINPEC party, I can assure you that our party's
political platform calls for a strong and lasting cooperation with
the CPP to provide political stability for long-term growth and
sustainable socioeconomic development."
</P>
<P>
The CPP and FUNCINPEC party formed the second coalition
government on November 1998 with CPP leader Hun Sen as the sole
prime minister of the new government. The two parties' first
attempt at a coalition government effectively ended in July 1997
when factional fighting erupted.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh said, "We learned from our recent past mistake
that exchanging gunshots in the street of Phnom Penh caused so
much pain and more suffering for our people and set the economic
development backward for so many years. Thirty years of hardship
for our people is enough. We cannot afford to inflict more
hardship on them."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prince appealed to investors to seriously
consider Cambodia as a place to do business.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Cambodia to hold such an important
investment conference and this indicates that foreign investors,
especially U.S. investors, are giving the country another look
since 1997.

<HEADLINE> UN Force Get Prepared to Defense S.Leonean Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations peacekeeping force
has been strengthening its positions around Sierra Leone's capital
Freetown to repel possible attempts by the country's rebels to
take the city, reports reaching here from Freetown said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that it is not going to come to a pitched battle, but
in effect we are preparing for one," said the UN spokesman Fred
Eckhard Thursday at UN headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The UN also quickened its steps to ship more reinforcement to
the west African nation.
</P>
<P>
Canada Wednesday announced that it would help the UN to
transport more than 1,000 soldiers from India and Bangladesh to
Freetown within the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Russia have said they would help with
transport and fly in supplies and some extra Jordanian troops,
possibly by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcements are part of an effort to bring the intended
11,000- strong UN force up to full strength. Currently there are
about 8,700 UN troops in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Though British Defense Ministry Wednesday rejected to involve
its troops in a combat role, the 700 British paratroops, arrived
earlier this week to evacuate British nationals had been seen
active in manning roadblocks at key junctions in the outskirts of
the city.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and other west African states say they are willing to
take part in a UN force if asked.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sierra Leone Wednesday announced that the
pro- government troops have been successful in pushing the rebels
back in some areas.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges All Sierra Leone Parties to Keep Promises on Child Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's Fund (
UNICEF) has called on all parties in Sierra Leone to keep their
promises of not recruiting child soldiers, according to a UNICEF
press release made available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned right now about the threat to children,"
said Joanna Van Gerpen, head of UNICEF's office in Sierra Leone. "
The very high level of instability could lead us back into the
vicious cycle where children are used as tools of war. This war is
the business of adults -- children shouldn't be forced to pay the
price."
</P>
<P>
She said that the current crisis in the country could result in
the renewed recruitment of child soldiers, a practice that most
military leaders have repeatedly disavowed in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that during Sierra Leone's nine-year civil war,

<HEADLINE> OECD Expects U.S. Economic Growth Rate to Be 4.5 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Thursday that the
economic growth rate in the United States is expected to attain 4.
5 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2001, higher than its
previous forecasts.
</P>
<P>
In a report published on Thursday, the OECD revised its
previous predictions that the growth rate in the U.S. would be 3.1
percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The OECD also suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve raise
again its interest rates in order to seek a sustained -- and more
moderate at the same time -- growth.
</P>
<P>
The organization said that after taking into account the rise
of the price of energy, inflation is low in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It also said that demand in the U.S. continues to grow faster
than supply, resulting in a high tension in the labor market, an
expanding trade deficit, and higher underlying inflation risks.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product growth rate of the U.S. stood at 4.2
percent in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Internet Refrigerator: Electrical Appliance of the Future? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An Internet refrigerator attracted
great attention from visitors to the Third Beijing International
High-Tech Week which opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new product was developed by Ericsson and Electrolux, the
two leading companies in telecoms and electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
"We make it possible to browse stores for the best prices
through a screen on the refrigerator," an Ericsson employee told
Xinhua today at an exhibition organized as part of the Beijing
High-Tech Week.
</P>
<P>
"We enable our consumers to write a shopping list on the
refrigerator screen, and with a button, to order the purchase
directly from the shop by a simple click."
</P>
<P>
She also said that in the future, the company's researchers
will be able to control the contents of the fridge with bar codes.
"For example, when you take out butter, this will be detected by
the fridge and you will be reminded to add butter to your shopping
list."
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that the new refrigerator represents part
of the future of electrical appliances, which eventually will be
able to connect with the Internet and make logging on in the
kitchen at home a reality.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Court Overrules Early Release of Murderer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's High Court of Justice
ruled Thursday morning that a controversial Jewish murderer, who
was sentenced to life imprisonment after slaying a Palestinian,
should not be granted early release after serving only seven years.
</P>
<P>
The initial order of early release was issued by the Prison
Parole Board in March on account of the criminal's alleged "
contrition and his good behavior in prison," which angered the
Palestinians and prompted liberal Israeli Knesset (parliament)
member Zahava Galon to file an appeal against the planned release.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's ruling, all seven members of the High Court panel
voted to uphold the petition from Galon and overturned the parole
board's decision to set the murderer free, sources in the court
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons for the verdict is that Israel's General
Security Service believed Yoram Shkolnik, the murderer, is still
posing a danger to the public, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Shkolnik was convicted of murder and sentenced for life after he
shot dead an Arab man, who was lying face down on the ground at
that time, in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
His sentence was commuted to 15 years by President Ezer Weizman
in 1997, and then reduced again by the president in 1999 to 11
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the early release order of Shkolnik by the parole board
finally irritated the Arab community and human rights groups in
Israel, who satirized that the life of an Arab is worth very
little, especially if the one who takes it is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the petition from Galon, who got support from
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Attorney Edna Arbel,
the court decided last month to put off the controversial release,
which was originally due to happen on April 3, until the final
ruling.

TEHRAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Foreign Ministry official
on Thursday rejected the Kuwaiti claim that Iran had carried out
drilling operations in Kuwaiti territorial waters in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed surprise over a report that Kuwaiti Oil
Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah has sent a letter to his
Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar Zanganeh urging Iran to stop
drilling in the Dorra gas field in Kuwaiti territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
The Dorra field is located in a sector of northern Gulf waters
where the demarcation has yet to be done.
</P>
<P>
Iran is ready to hold talks to determine borders with Kuwait,
the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"We had informed the Kuwaiti officials of the issue two years
ago but received no response yet," he said, quoted by the official
IRNA news agency.
</P>
<P>
He called on Kuwaiti officials to expedite efforts to answer
Iran's appeal for defining border lines.

He said that consolidation of relations with neighboring
countries is a priority of Iran's foreign policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government commended
anew Thursday the military for continuing to do a good job in the
southern island of Mindanao, where fighting recently erupted in
isolated areas between government troops and rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Rolando Zamora said the military, assisted
by the Philippine National Police, has been doing its best in
protecting the people and maintaining peace and order in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"It is so easy to be an armchair general and tell the military
on what it must do or must not do when you don't have to weigh
your options given your limitations," Zamora said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
But he assured the public that the police and military are
taking the criticisms "in the right spirit" and are working to
improve on their weak points.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 soldiers have been killed and hundreds more
wounded as a result of military operations foiling attacks by the
separatist rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front on the civilians in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In Sulu Province, the government continues to negotiate for the
safe release of the 21 hostages held captive by Abu Sayyaf
extremists since April 23, with the military cordoning off the
area where they are being held to prevent the kidnappers from
escaping.
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, Zamora said, the hostage takers have sought a
24-hour extension to decide whether to allow the release of an
ailing German hostage, Renate Wallert.
</P>
<P>
He said this was the message the group relayed to President
Joseph Estrada through Robert Aventajado, chairman of the
presidential committee on flagship programs and projects.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said medicines and other supplies have
reached the hostages and the government is hopeful that they can
be administered to them immediately.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund (
IMF)has expressed its satisfaction over Thailand's progress in
reviving its crisis-stricken economy, the official Thai News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in its latest report on the final review of the
Thai economy that impressive recovery has been observed in
Thailand over the past two years, after the country was hard hit
by its worst-ever economic turmoil in 50 years in mid-1997,
according to Thai News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also said the objective of the assistance program to
Thailand has been well-met, as the recovering process in the Thai
economy is progressing with continued reform efforts to address
weaknesses in the country's key institutions.
</P>
<P>
The IMF indicated that the economic growth rate in Thailand
this year is likely to exceed 4 percent, with low-level inflation,
expanding exports and a healthy balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based institution suggested, however, that Thai
government should control and tackle budget deficits to check the
growth of public debts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Standard and Poor, a leading U.S. rating agency, has
suggested that Thailand should speed up its pace to address the
problem of non-performance loans in the banking sector to help
strengthen its economic recovering process.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Investment Conference Held in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A two-day Cambodia Investment
2000 Conference kicked off here Thursday in an effort to asses the
country's investment situation.
</P>
<P>
More than 220 investors and interested parties are attending
the conference co-sponsored by the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council and
Dataconsult. Participants include international powerhouses like
Citibank, lockheed Martin, Chevron and Caltex.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Cambodia to hold such an important
investment conference and this indicates that foreign investors,
especially U.S. investors, are giving the country another look
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
It would not have been possible one or two years ago for such a
meeting to take place, due to political instability in the country
and the Asian economic crisis, according to some participants. Now,
the time is right for investors to return, starting with the
conference, they said.
</P>
<P>
National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh briefed
the participants on the country's political and economic situation.
He also assured them that the unity and strong and lasting
cooperation between the two ruling parties will ensure political
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen and other top-level government officials
and business experts will also address the conference about the
country's business sectors.
</P>
<P>
Investors will hear from the government about the business
climate in Cambodia and take a look around to make preliminary
assessments of the business potential here.

<HEADLINE> First Woman Aspirant Joins Zanzibar Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar Minister for Finance
Amina Salum Ali has become the first woman in history to run for
the president of the Indian Ocean islands, the Guardian newspaper
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Amina, 44, on Wednesday picked the presidential nomination
forms at the ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) sub-head office at
Kisiwandui, Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
She told reporters that in case she was elected president of
Zanzibar, her first major task would be to revive the economy,
which is in shambles after donor countries suspended aid after the
1995 elections.
</P>
<P>
So far, three other aspirants have picked the nomination forms
to vie for the CCM candidate for Zanzibar Presidency.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Deputy Minister for Finance Abdisalaam Issa
Khatibu, Communication and Transport Minister Amani Abeid Karume,
and Member of Parliament Ahmed Hassan Diria.
</P>
<P>
Though it joined with mainland Tanganyika to form the United
Republic of Tanzania in 1964, Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous state
with its own government and parliament.
</P>
<P>
Presidential, parliamentary and civic elections in Tanzania as
well as in Zanzibar are scheduled for October 29 at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects Council of Europe Demand for Truce in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia rejected on Thursday a demand
by the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe for a unilateral
ceasefire in Chechnya, according to reports from Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
By rejecting the demand, Russia risks a suspension of its
membership in the pan-European organization.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in Strasbourg that it
is not reasonable to establish a unilateral ceasefire in Chechnya,
where Russian troops have been fighting separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov is in the eastern French city to attend a meeting of the
Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which serves as
the executive organ of the council.
</P>
<P>
He described some demands by the Parliamentary Assembly of the
Council of Europe as "reasonable," and some "unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
"As for all which have to do with humanitarian problems (in
Chechnya), Russia has already taken the measures and is ready to
do more," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited as an example Russia's acceptance of three officials
sent by the Council of Europe to work in a bureau of human rights
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Parliamentary Assembly suggested a suspension of Russia's
membership in the Council of Europe last month for "human rights
violations" in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Ministers of the Council is meeting to study
the resolution by the assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is to hold two world record
breaking attempts in extreme sports in summer 2000, the Cyprus
Mail newspaper reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China Tops World in Production of VCD Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua)-- China has become the world's biggest
producer of VCD players and the largest potential market for the
product, according to today's China Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
China's VCD player output rose to 20 million from 20,000 six
years. The annual output of DVD players increased from 50,000
three years ago to over two million now, the newspaper quoted
statistics released by the China Electronics Audio and Visual
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, 70 million VCD players and one million DVD
players were sold in China, and Chinese-made VCD and DVD players
have grabbed the lion's share of the market.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China exported 5.17 million VCD players and exports
of DVD players surpassed domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that sales of DVD players in China would
triple that of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- It was claimed that an organization in connection with Iran's
Revolutionary Guard Corps has played an important role in political
killings, including the murder of famous journalist Ugur Mumcu in
1993, in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Some suspects in the Mumcu assassination case confessed in their
testimonies that the Iranians they worked with were the agents of "
the Warriors of Jerusalem," a secret organization reportedly
founded in 1987 upon the call of late Iranian supreme leader Imam
Khomeini to export Islamic revolution to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- It was found out that the traditionalist wing of the pro-
Islamic opposition Virtue Party had changed the statute of party to
hinder some representatives of the party's moderate wing from being
elected.
</P>
<P>
The two factions have been struggling for the control of the
party before the general congress of the party to be held next
week.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- John Wolf, advisor to the United States president and
secretary of state on Caspian energy, said Wednesday that the Baku-
Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline will definitely be built and ready for
service by the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
Wolf made the remark at a three-day conference organized by the
Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Istanbul.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority officials admitted Wednesday
that it was very unlikely that Israel and the Palestinians can
resolve the issues of Jerusalem and refugees by the September
deadline for a final peace deal, but the Palestinians also refuse
to sign an agreement that does not include these two issues.
</P>
<P>
"If we find a beginning for solving these issues by then ... we
will be able to agree on a new timetable for their implementation,"
a Palestinian official said, adding that a final peace deal must at
least include the principles on which these issued will be solved.
</P>
<P>
Following the inconclusive round of peace talks last week and
the lackluster summit Sunday night between Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, negotiations will
resume Thursday in an unspecified location near Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the steering committee for interim issues will meet
again. On Monday, U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is expected to
return and join the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is prepared to conduct talks with Egypt about arms
control, in which the two countries will present their differing
views.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will try to set an agenda for multilateral
talks on arms control and regional security, which have been frozen
for the past five years due to Egyptian demands, and Israeli
refusal, to talk about Israel's nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been pressuring Israel to start quiet arms
talks with Egypt, and an international conference in Moscow last
February called on both sides to agree on an agenda for
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- In an Israeli-Palestinian framework draft obtained by
Ma'ariv, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to hand over about 66
percent of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to Palestinians' full
control, with another 14 percent to be transferred in a few years.
Israel will annex less than 20 percent West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the Jordan Valley is earmarked as the
region to be transferred in a later stage, and Israel will keep a
narrow strip along the river as security zone.
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish settlements will remain in the Palestinian areas
after Israel troops pullback, and some Palestinians will also live
in the areas to be annexed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman collapsed Wednesday afternoon
at an Independence Day reception for the diplomatic corps at his
office. The incident occurred after the president gave his speech
and spoke with the press.
</P>
<P>
However, his doctor said the president is "fine, fantastic."
Reports said Weizman had suffered from dehydration and high blood
pressure. He attended the Israel Prize ceremony several hours
later.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, at a reception for current and past
generals, the president hinted that this might be his last
Independence Day as president, saying: "Next year perhaps I will
come as a guest."

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel at Odds Over Alleged Armenian Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government instructed cabinet
members not to attend Israeli embassy's national day reception here
Wednesday night to show its displeasure with Israel's position
regarding the alleged Armenian genocide.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News on Thursday quoted informed sources as saying
that Ankara is still unsatisfied with Israel's explanation that
there was no policy change on the Israeli side over the alleged
genocide.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 85th anniversary of the so-called
Armenian genocide on April 24, Armenians worldwide, in cities such
as Moscow, Tehran, Brussels and Athens, staged anti-Turkish
demonstrations in front of Turkish embassies.
</P>
<P>
Armenians say that 1.5 million of their people were massacred
between 1915 and 1923 as part of a genocidal campaign aimed to
force out eastern Turkey's Armenian population during the late
years of the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
Turkey says that there was no such systematic slaughter and that
many Armenians fled the country of their own volition during war
and civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
In a radio broadcast, Israeli Education Minister Yossi Sarid
proposed including accounts of this incident in the Israeli high
school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin said the
incident in the Ottoman Empire involving Armenians could be called
nothing but "genocide."
</P>
<P>
The United States President Bill Clinton also made a written
statement to mark the occasion, recalling the "deportations and
massacres of approximately 1.5 million Armenians in the final years
of the Ottoman Empire." But Clinton deliberately avoided using the
word "genocide" in his statement.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was angered by the Israeli ministers' statements,
wondering whether this signaled an official policy shift over the
sensitive Armenian issue.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, Israeli embassy here contended that the two
ministers' remarks were their personal views and in no way
represent the government position.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Israeli Embassy's statement fell short of
satisfying Turkey and that Ankara expects a "satisfactory"
statement to be made by Israeli government on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Overshadowed by the so-called Armenian genocide issue though,
observers here believe, the governments of Turkey and Israel could
hardly afford to let the issue undermine their overall relations,
military ties in particular.

<HEADLINE> Israel OKs Bypass Construction on Palestinian Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security establishment has
authorized the construction of a bypass road leading to two Jewish
settlements in the West Bank at the expense of Palestinian land,
reported a local daily Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian land in the area of the villages of Za'atra and Beit
Sahour will have to be appropriated for the road leading to the
settlements of Tekoa and Nokdim, southeast of Bethlehem, reported
Ha'aretz.
</P>
<P>
The road, named highway 356, was endorsed following repeated
postponements by the committee in charge of planning and
construction in Israel's Civil Administration on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tekoa and Nokdim are almost the last two settlements in the West
Bank whose residents currently have to travel through Palestinian
villages to gain access to their homes. The new road will give
residents direct access to Jerusalem through the neighborhood of
Har Homa, another new settlement Israel decided to build in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Har Homa is located between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. The
Palestinian side pointed out that Har Homa is the West Bank
territory and strongly opposed Israel's decision to build thousands
of new housing units there. This issue had halted the Palestinian-
Israeli talks for one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that another bypass road in the advanced planning
stage is the Lahav-Eshkolot road in the southern Mount Hebron area,
which is also dependent on the appropriation of Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
The construction of bypass roads drew criticism not only from
the Palestinian side, but from inside Israel as well.
</P>
<P>
Mussi Raz, a senior member of the leftist Meretz party,
lambasted the decision, saying "supporters of peace are sick of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's hypocrisy and his breaking of promises,
especially the promise to suspend all construction of houses and
bypass roads in the territories."
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have expressed vehement opposition to the bypass
construction. Among them is Salah Tamari, a senior Palestinian
National Authority official, whose family has a lot of land in the
area of the future bypass.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's largest political
party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), Thursday
confirmed at its general assembly Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
as the party's president for the 2000-2003 term, indicating that
he will continue leading the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here by UMNO Election Committee Chairman
Kamarul Ariffin at the venue of the assembly.
</P>
<P>
UMNO is the backbone of the ruling 14-party Barisal Nasional (
National Front) and its president, by Malaysian political
practices,is the person for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who was first elected UMNO president in 1981, was
nominated by 164 of the 165 UMNO divisions throughout Malaysia for
the post of party president last month.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's retaining of the top party post means that he has
enough time to decide when he will pass the power to his successor.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who became the country's prime minister on July 16,
1981, is the longest serving prime minister in the country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Save Industries Threatened by Smuggled Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government will
take measures to rescue local industries threatened by cheap
smuggled imports.
</P>
<P>
The intervention comes as dumped goods such as dry cell
batteries, mild steel, jute bags, shoes, crown corks, galvanized
corrugated iron sheets and textiles, continue to flood the local
market, threatening to drive industries out of business, the
Guardian newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to chief executives of the country's largest trading
companies on Wednesday, the Minister for Industry and Commerce
Iddi Simba said the government could no longer sit back and
witness industries being driven out of business by cheap imports.
</P>
<P>
If the situation is allowed to continue, warned the minister,
several major enterprises will be forced to go into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, General Tire (East Africa) Ltd., has
already suspended production citing cheap tire imports, while low
quality imported dry battery cells threaten to drive the Dar es
Salaam-based Matsushita Electric Co. (East Africa) factory out of
business.
</P>
<P>
Imported goods should pay taxes and dumping should be
forbidden, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, Simba explained, it is not the intention of the
government to over-protect local industries at the expense of
efficiency and the welfare of the consumer.
</P>
<P>
"It is the level playing field we should all seek and maintain.
It is the need to adhere to business ethics and the rule of law,"
he was quoted as saying.

<P>
NAIOROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan National Assembly has
passed a motion to give lawmakers guns and bodyguards for
protection at a cost of 25 million shillings (about 338,000 U.S.
dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The demand for guns followed the shooting of two members of

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the government was strongly opposed to the motion,
saying that insecurity was a problem to all Kenyans and not only
to lawmakers.

<P>
"All Kenyans should be treated equally and they should be
protected," said Minister of State Marsden Madoka when addressing
the parliament on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Voter Registration Starts for Kenyan General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The voter registration for Kenya's
2002 general election began on Thursday throughout the east
African country ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, Chairman of the Electoral
Commission Samuel Kivuitu asked Kenyans to turn out in large
numbers, adding that the registration period ends on June 9.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million people out of a population of 28 million in
the country are expected to register and another nine million
people will renew their registration in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Members of opposition parties have slammed the exercise, saying
that it took place earlier than the scheduled timetable.
</P>
<P>
Kivuitu dismissed the criticism by claiming that the commission
had to use 20 million shillings (about 270,000 U.S. dollars) for
voter registration before the next budget starting from July 1.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds would damage the electoral body's capacity to
carry out a free, fair and well-organized elections, Kivuitu
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We had asked for 60 million shillings (about 810,000 U.S.
dollars) from the Treasury Ministry for this voter registration
exercise but we got a paltry 20 million shillings (around 270,000
dollars)," said Kivuitu.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the commission would not be able to extend the
registration period beyond June 9 due to inadequate funds.

<HEADLINE> Intel to Replace Circuit Boards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., the world's
largest maker of microprocessors, said it will replace up to 1
million circuit boards that could cause computers to
intermittently freeze or reboot.
</P>
<P>
Intel said in a press release issued Wednesday that it plans to
reserve for the cost associated with the replacement program when
it determines what the cost will be. Depending on how many circuit
boards are replaced, the amount of this reserve could be "material,
" the release said.
</P>
<P>
"When a cost reaches a few hundred million dollars, then we
consider it to be material," said Intel spokesman Michael Sullivan.
"At this point, it's too early to know whether it will be material.
"
</P>
<P>
The problem relates to certain motherboards Intel manufactured
after November 1999. Motherboards are printed circuit boards that
hold a computer's central processing unit, RAM chips, and
expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
Intel made a chipset called the "820" that can be used with two
types of computer memory -- a higher performance type called R-
DRAM and an older, slower type called S-DRAM. The company made a
component called a "memory translator hub" that enables the 820
chipset to be used with S-DRAM. Intel said in its release that
some of those memory translator hubs give off electrical noise
that can cause a computer to freeze or reboot.
</P>
<P>
Intel said it does not know which PC makers used the
motherboards with the potentially defective memory translator hubs
because some of its products are sold through intermediaries,
rather than directly to PC equipment makers.
</P>
<P>
"Fewer than one million units were shipped to end customers.
Not all seem to have this issue, but some do," Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
Intel said that people who bought a PC made after November 1999
should check with the manufacturer to determine if it contains the
memory translator hub used with the 820 chipset and S-DRAM.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Intel placed a utility on its Web site that can
determine whether a user's machine has the potentially defective
component. That utility can be downloaded at www.intel.com/support/
mth.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Hewlett-Packard said only one product of one
line, from HP's high-end business workstations, is impacted by
Intel's defective motherboards. HP is putting a hold on shipments
of all HP Kayak XM600 S-DRAM models.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Dell said the defective component
does not affect any of the company's products.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Relations With Japan: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan said here Thursday that the Chinese government
attaches great importance to Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral ties between the two countries have in general
maintained a smooth development in recent years, Tang said during
a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
The two countries specified the general direction and
priorities for bilateral cooperation during Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in 1998 and former Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit to China last year, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Tang expressed the belief that bilateral friendly and
cooperative relations would be further solidified and enhanced as
long as the two sides strictly abide by the principles set forth
in the "Sino-Japanese Joint Statement," "China-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty" and "Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration," and
based on the long-term strategy oriented toward the 21st century
and actively seek and expand common benefits.
</P>
<P>
To handle historical issues with a correct attitude is an
important political foundation for the development of Sino-
Japanese relations, Tang stressed.
</P>
<P>
"While not forgetting history, we should have our eyes more on
the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the question of Taiwan is an internal affair of
China, Tang expounded China's principle stance on the Taiwan issue
following the change of political situation inside the Taiwan
island.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Japanese ties will see long-term, healthy and stable
development so long as historical issues and issues related to the
question of Taiwan are handled properly, Tang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Japan-China relationship is one of the most important bilateral
relationship for both countries, Mori said, adding that bilateral
ties have maintained a smooth development momentum.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will continue to devote to the
development of bilateral friendly and cooperative relations on the
basis of the three political documents formulated by the two
countries, Mori said.
</P>
<P>
Mori, who took office after his predecessor Keizo Obuchi
suffered a stroke in early April, said he will honor the various
consensus reached by the former Japanese prime minister and the
Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's stance revealed so far on the Taiwan
issue will not be changed, Mori added.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived here Wednesday for a four-day official visit,
also met separately with leaders of Japan's six ruling and
opposition parties, which include the Liberal Democratic Party,
New Komeito party, New Conservative Party, Democratic Party of
Japan, Japan Communist Party and Social Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Tang and the Japanese party leaders
exchanged views on how to properly handle the Taiwan issue,
eliminate disturbances from Japan's right-wing forces and maintain
the healthy and stable development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The party leaders said that promoting friendship between Japan
and China is a concerted view of every party, adding that they are
willing to make unremitting efforts for the enhancement of
bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal won the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award, but
Lakers point guard Kobe Bryant won Game Two against the Phoenix
Suns Wednesday night in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
Bryant's fallaway jumper with 2.6 seconds remaining lifted the
Lakers to a thrilling 97-96 victory over the Suns, giving them a 2-
0 lead in their Western Conference semi-final series.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, who accepted his trophy before Wednesday night's game,
had 38 points, 20 rebounds and four blocked shots. In the final
seconds, he blocked a runner by Hardaway in the lane to set the
stage for Bryant, who took Jason Kidd one-on-one, and won.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Bryant, limited to 34 minutes by foul problems,
finished with 15 points, and Glen Rice added 13 for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
Robinson led the Suns with a career playoff high 30 points, and
Hardaway, who missed a desperation shot as time expired, had 27
points and eight assists. Jason Kidd, shrugging off a sore left
ankle, played 43 minutes and had 13 points, eight rebounds and six
assists.
</P>
<P>
The best-of-seven series shifts to Phoenix for Game 3 on Friday
night and Game 4 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Only seven teams in NBA history have rallied from a 2-0 deficit
to win a series, and considering the Lakers are 6-0 against
Phoenix this season and 18-3 in the last 21 games between the
teams, the Suns' chances wouldn't appear very good.

<HEADLINE> Expert: China's Software Industry Has Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's software industry has the
potential strength to meet the challenges that will arise from
foreign software companies after China joins the World Trade
Organization, if it brings its strong points into full play.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenjing, board chairman and president of UF Software Corp.
Ltd., China's biggest financial and business management software
provider, made the remark in an interview today.
</P>
<P>
At a forum held at the ongoing Beijing High-Tech Week, the
engineer-turned entrepreneur said it will not be easy for China to
catch up with foreign software providers in system-operating
software, since they already dominate the world market.
</P>
<P>
But China has advantages for developing applications software,
he said, citing his UF Software and its financial applications
which are very popular in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that timely industrialization is also important for
China's software industry, adding that "there is a sea of
difference between a 20-staff company and a 2,000-staff company."
</P>
<P>
But good management and strict control over quality and product
costs are always keys for success, he added, citing American's top
software providers ORACLE and CISCO as examples.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a legendary figure in China's software sector, set up his
UF in 1988 with 50,000 yuan (about 6,000 U.S. dollars) borrowed
from friends. His company soon emerged as the country's biggest
software provider, with a market share first in China for 10
consecutive years. Last year this market share amounted to 40
percent, with sales surpassing 300 million yuan (36 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said young Chinese software developers should have a
persevering spirit in their independent career pursuits, and
warned them not to blindly follow fashion.
</P>
<P>
Other experts attending Wednesday's forum agreed that the
development of financial and educational software that caters to
China's needs will enable the country's software companies to grab
and expand their market shares, and meet the challenges posed by
their foreign counterparts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The China National Star Petroleum
Company (CNSPC) is planning to verify 200 billion cubic meters of
natural gas in the Tarim Basin in west China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region during the next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
According to CNSPC's gas development plan, the company expects

an annual gas production capacity of 5.4 billion cubic meters by
the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
And by the end of 2002, the volume of verified natural gas
would increase to 146.5 billion cubic meters in Tarim, with annual
gas production capacity hitting 5.85 billion cubic meters, a

</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin is China's largest oil and gas bearing basin
with total oil and gas resources equivalent to 20.6 billion tons
of oil, including 9.29 trillion cubic meters of gas resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the country's energy plan of transporting gas from
west to east, the Tarim gas field will begin sending gas in the

In line with the country's gas development plan, the gas
produced in western China will be piped to the economically
developed Yangtze River Delta area around Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to invest more than 55 billion yuan to build
a 4,200-km-long gas pipeline which will run through 10 provinces,

CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Australia dipped
slightly to 6.8 percent in April, as 37,400 new jobs were created,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
That brought the number of new jobs created so far this year to
96,000, although most of them have been taken up by new job
seekers with 80,000 joining the labor force in just four months.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said most of the new jobs created in April were part-
time, with 12,500 full-time jobs and 24,900 part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment is still above the decade-low of 6.7 percent
achieved in February this year, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The strong job growth was good news for the embattled
Australian dollar which soared by nearly half a U.S. cent in just
15 minutes on news of the figures, which contradict evidence that
the economy is slowing.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Another four people in Australia
were Thursday confirmed with legionnaires' disease sourced to the
Melbourne Aquarium, bringing the number of such cases to 91.
</P>
<P>
So far the aquarium outbreak has claimed two lives while 19
people are still in hospital, six of them in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Legionnaires' disease is an acute respiratory infection caused
by bacteria that may contaminate water or soil.
</P>
<P>
A 77-year-old man died Wednesday night following complications
from the disease but he had not been confirmed as a victim of the
aquarium outbreak, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they were unable to speak to the man and his
relatives had not been sure whether he visited the aquarium during
the April 11-25 danger period.
</P>
<P>
Federal Finance Minister John Fahey is among those diagnosed
with the illness and is recovering at home after visiting the
aquarium for a Liberal Party function last month.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak is the largest in Australia, although the worst
was in 1987 when there were fewer cases but 10 people died.

Ugandan members of Parliament to the Rwandan capital Kigali to
discuss possibilities of normalizing relations between the two

<P>
But Rwandan Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs Seth Kamanzi was quoted as saying that the trip had "not
been okayed".
</P>

they wanted to come to Kigali" in the letters from Uganda.

Elly Karuhanga, chairman of the Ugandan parliamentary committee

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will import more electricity
from neighboring Uganda due to a serious power deficit, according
to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times Thursday quoted Kenyan Minister for Energy
Francis Masakhalia as saying that the hydro-power generating
sector faced a major set-back caused by persistent drought in most
areas of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Masakhalia said that the power from Uganda will make up 30
percent of the total domestic supply in Kenya, up from 10 percent
currently.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that a low water level at dams had crippled
the capacity of generating power by 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Limited power capacity had forced the government to undertake
rationing system which affected the economy greatly, Masakhalia
said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has adopted power rationing system since last September,
which has hampered the industry and brought inconvenience to
residents' daily lives.

LUSAKA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) is considering establishment of a special
fund for small and medium-sized enterprises, Zambia Daily Mail

</P>
<P>
The establishment of the fund is expected to cushion the severe

He said that the matter of creating a financial framework to
provide funds to those enterprises is receiving serious
consideration from the authority.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the FTA competition may create winners and
losers, but in the case of these enterprises, we really need them
because they're the back bone of any successful economy in the
world," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos in U.S. Evacuated for Raging Wildfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A raging wildfire Wednesday
drove all 11,000 residents from the town of Los Alamos in New
Mexico and briefly set fire to a building inside the biggest U.S.
nuclear weapons laboratory, where high explosives and plutonium
are bunkered in disaster-proof shelters, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
The on-going fire also forced authorities to ask residents in
parts of Espanola, about 16 kilometers from Los Alamos, to leave
their homes, Mayor Richard Lucero said.
</P>
<P>
Homes in western and northern parts of the city began burning
in late afternoon. The extent of the damage was not immediately
known, according to local officials who estimated 4,500 acres had
burned by Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which started when a fire deliberately set by the U.S.
National Park Service ran out of control, was sending embers into
the grounds of the laboratory, where the world's first atomic bomb
was built in 1945, but officials said they were being extinguished
quickly. A weapons research building briefly caught fire,
sustaining minor damage, a spokesman for the laboratory said.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear lab keeps plutonium and high explosives on its area
of 43 square miles, but officials said they were safely stored in
steel and concrete bunkers and the nuclear material was far away
from the fire.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Bill Clinton declared the city a disaster
area, giving the Federal Emergency Management Agency discretion to
use whatever resources necessary to handle the emergency.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo, Nikkei Closes Below 17,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Thursday, hit by weakness in high-priced information and
technology issues, with the benchmark Nikkei index closing below
17,000 for the first time in seven and a half months.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange marked its second largest one-

<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all

shares from Wednesday's 554.23 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries was the day's volume
leader.

decline in the technology-heavy NASDAQ composite index in New York,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses also saw large declines, while real estate
firms, wholesalers and chemical firms were included in losers.
</P>

Investors' cautious stance ahead of Friday's special quotation
settlement of May options was another factor leading Tokyo share
prices lower, traders said.

<P>
Meanwhile, electric power and gas firms, nonlife insurers and
rubber makers drew buying.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far outpaced

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 of China's 668 cities
are facing a water shortage, and of the 400, more than 100 are
seriously threatened by the water shortage.
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly half of China's rivers and over 90 percent
of its urban water resources have been polluted to some extent,
said Zhou Wenzhi, vice-minister of Water Resources, at an
international seminar on the guarantee of water resources for
sustainable development in the 21st century, which closed here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities have a total annual water shortage of six
billion cubic meters, the vice-minister said, adding that China's
per capita water resource is only less than one fourth of the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
Water resources are no longer a cheap resource that was once
believed to be "inexhaustible," said Zhou, who called for a
harmonious relationship between human beings and nature.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the concept of "water saving" should be widely
introduced and management and protection of precious water
resources must be given greater importance.
</P>
<P>
China should also strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the
rest of the world, and learn from those countries which have been
successful in saving water resources, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Aventis to Produce Liver Medicine in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A joint venture with Aventis, a
world leader in pharmaceuticals, will produce the Aventis liver
medicine formula called Essentiale in China beginning next year to
replace expensive imported products.
</P>
<P>
Many millions of sufferers of chronic liver illnesses will be
able to spend less on the medicine when production begins.
Essentiale has occupied more than 30 percent of the market since
its entry into China in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The medicine, whose major component is lecithin extracted from
soy beans, can be used to restore damaged liver cells, and has
been proved effective in the rehabilitation of chronic liver
disease, fatty liver, alcohol-related liver disorders, and liver
injury, according to doctor Xu Daozhen of the Beijing Ditan
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 30 million to 50 million liver patients
in China every year, and about 300,000 of them die each year. The
country also has 120 million carriers of hepatitis B virus, one
fourth of whom may eventually develop chronic liver disease.
</P>
<P>
Scientists now are adopting a therapy combining Essentiale and
Interferon-a to treat chronic liver disease.
</P>
<P>
The new capsules and injection will be produced by a Beijing
joint venture, one of two plants opened by Aventis in China.
</P>
<P>
Aventis was started by two of the world's largest international
chemical companies, Rhone-Poulenc of France, and Hoechst
Aktiengesellschaft of Germany, whose health-related unit Aventis
Pharma now has China headquarters in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> DPRK to Join Regional Security Forum: Thai FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) has decided to join the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), a
multilateral body concerned with regional security, the Nation
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan was quoted as saying that
the DPRK's Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun had sent him a formal
application, saying that Pyongyang wanted to join the ARF and
would abide by its objectives and principles. Surin circulated the
letter to all ARF member countries on May 8 for approval.
</P>
<P>
"At present, every member welcomes (DPRK's letter of
application). It is good news for the evolution of security in
Asia-Pacific," Surin was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be discussed here next week when senior
officials of ARF member countries meet and determine the steps
ahead of announcing the DPRK's membership.
</P>
<P>
Surin said this will mean that the DPRK will become an ARF
member at the forum's meeting here in July. The meeting is held
back-to-back with the annual ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's move to join the ARF was another building block in
international efforts to restore peace on the Korean peninsula,
Surin said.
</P>
<P>
It demonstrated Pyongyang's will to maintain cordial relations
with other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1994 in Bangkok, the ARF comprises the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other Asian and Pacific rim
nations, including the United States, China, Japan, Canada, Russia,
Papua New Guinea, Mongolia and India.

<HEADLINE> American Consumers Urged to Watch Water Infrastructure Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. nongovernmental
organization Wednesday urged American consumers to support efforts
to finance their country's water infrastructure crisis.
</P>
<P>
The American Water Works Association (AWWA) made its
recommendation during the ongoing national discussion of
challenges facing drinking water providers being held as part of
the celebration of National Drinking Water Week.
</P>
<P>
"The water infrastructure crisis is largely a product of
history," AWWA said. According to the group which leads efforts to
advance the science, technology and consumer awareness related to
drinking water, much of the United States' current water
infrastructure was built in the immediate aftermath of World War
II and is now over 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
While regular utility maintenance has kept the infrastructure
performing well, the group said, normal wear and tear has begun to
take its toll nationwide. As the old pipe continues to degrade
utilities in many areas will have to begin focusing on replacing
old pipe rather than trying to continually repair it, which
requires substantial investment.
</P>
<P>
AWWA estimates that improving the drinking and wastewater
infrastructure nationwide could cost up to 1 trillion U.S. dollars
over the next 20 years. Infrastructure investment by utilities is
falling 23 billion dollars short annually due to expensive
treatment and technology upgrades needed to comply with increasing
federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
Water infrastructure in the United States is four times as
large of the country's interstate highway system, according to
AWWA, but because it lies mostly underground, its degradation has
been invisible to consumers and the government. "Without a
comprehensive solution to this crisis, consumers will witness its
seriousness firsthand as their water rates climb higher," the
group said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Labor Ministers' Meeting Opens in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The 14th ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Labor Ministers' Meeting (ALMM) opened
Thursday in Manila with the aim to strengthen economic, social and
cultural cooperation among its 10 member states.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said he hoped the meeting will further strengthen ASEAN
unity and cooperation, "particularly in the fields of labor,
employment, industrial relations, and human resource development."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the employment sector was the first to suffer when
the Asian financial crisis struck the region in 1997 and he hoped
the ministers can design "an appropriate labor and employment
policy that supports both growth with employment, as well as
employment with social equity."
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN member states must look both inward at their
own strengths and outward to respond to the call of global
governance through more constructive terms of engagement not only
among member states but also with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Labor ministers from Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam attended the opening ceremony of the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said the ASEAN
labor ministers will discuss a five-year program of action in
formulating and strengthening policies for social protection,
employment, income generation and promotion of social cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma said he hoped the ASEAN member states would help each
other in recovering from the financial crisis and in strengthening
or setting up institutions that would respond more effective and
decisively to a similar crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is one of the five founding members of ASEAN,
an economic common market that was formed on August 8, 1967. The
first ALMM was held in Jakarta in 1975 while the ongoing 14th ALMM
is the fourth hosted by the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Partnership for Peace to Benefit Croatia's Foreign Policy: Mesic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Stipe Mesic said
Wednesday that Croatia's entry into NATO's Partnership for Peace (
PfP) program is a major step taken by the country in realizing the
strategic target of its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement shortly after NATO accepted
Croatia as its 27th PfP country early Wednesday, noting that more
measures are needed to realize the strategic target in Croatia's
foreign policy, according to Croatian TV and radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Croatia is still to sign the official Partnership for Peace
document in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The former Yugoslav republic was admitted PfP entry for its "
increasing democratization," according to NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and Macedonia, also former Yugoslav republics, are
already members of the Partnership for Peace program of the
western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The other PfP member states are Albania, Armenia, Austria,
Azerbaijan, Belarussia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Finland, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzastan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Moldova,
Romania, Russia Slovakia, Sweden, Turkemenistan, Ukraine and
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government applied for PfP membership in February.
</P>
<P>
Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan also told the press
Wednesday that the admittance was very important for Croatia,
saying that the move indicates "NATO has spotted the progress made
by the new Croatian government in carrying out its policies."
</P>
<P>
The PfP is a brainchild of the 16-member NATO, which set up the
PfP in 1994 to help foster relations with its former Warsaw Pact
adversaries and other neutral nations.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urged to Patent Their Inventions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists should make
better use of patents to protect their inventions worldwide,
according to today's Guangming Daily, a national newspaper
targeted at intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Scientists in China turn out over 30,000 items of scientific
achievements at the state-level each year, but they only apply
patent for some 10,000 of them.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that China has given away free to
other parts of the world more than 110,000 items of inventions
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The losses of high technologies due to lack of patent
protection have been enormous, the newspaper said, urging Chinese
inventors to be fully aware of the patent laws of China and other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
It is universally accepted that inventions are protected only
when they have applied for and been granted patents in a given
jurisdiction. They are not protected in other jurisdictions unless
they have applied for and been granted patents there.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, China had received over 115,900 patent
applications from domestic inventors, while only 3,000 Chinese
inventions applied for patent protection in other parts of the
world, the paper said.

</P>
<P>
IA suspended all its flights to Nepal after its passenger plane
was hijacked during a flight from Kathmandu to New Delhi on

<P>
NANJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought affecting some 1.3
million hectares of crops in east China's Jiangsu Province, one of
the country's economic powerhouses, has been eased thanks to cloud
seeding efforts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said today the cloud seeding operations have
brought about 10 to 20 mm of rainfall to 23 counties in the
northern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
Drought began to loom in Jiangsu late last year. Since February
this year the province has had only one-third as much
precipitation as in the same period of normal years.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of rainfall, water levels in major lakes and
reservoirs in northern Jiangsu have declined to a record low.
</P>
<P>
Measures have also been taken to pump water from the Yangtze
River to the drought-stricken areas over the past months.

<HEADLINE> Largest Rare Stone Trade Center Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's largest rare stone trade
center has formed in Linqu, a mountainous county in east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Various rare stones both from China and foreign countries are
traded in the 40,000-sq-m center.
</P>
<P>
Last year total turnover of the trade center reached 250
million yuan (about 30.12 million U.S. dollars), ranking first in
all rare stone trade centers in the country.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Chinese have been keen on collecting
rare natural stones in recent years as living standards improved
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Rare stone markets have already been set up in Guangdong, Henan
and Liaoning provinces as well as in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
A rare stone exhibition held in the city of Luoyang in Henan
this year attracted more than 100,000 visitors and some 300 stone-
collectors from 28 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities throughout China.

<HEADLINE> New Economy Era Requires Quality College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- China's renowned economist Li
Yining has called on college students today to be ready to accept
new ideas, be creative and cooperative and good at management and
market expansion in the "new economy" era.
</P>
<P>
All college students are supposed to be quick at accepting
changes and be aware that they should make greater contributions
to the country's reform.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, principal and professor of Institute of Business
Administration of Beijing University, said that China's reform has
taken on a whole new range of meanings today.
</P>
<P>
Reform does not only happen to the enterprises running at a
loss, but more to the ones running perfectly well, as changes will
enable the rising companies to better achieve their long-term
interests and bigger economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Also, a broad range of knowledge is a requirement for today's
college students. Those with abundant knowledge in specific fields
but not much in other fields will not do well in the new era.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, all the students will have to learn ABCs in such
fields to make substantial achievements in their careers, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that team-work is becoming more and more important
for the survival and development of enterprises today, especially
in the high-tech field.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that Beijing University is striving to
nurture its students this way.

<HEADLINE> Genome Project Enters Final Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Human Genome Project (HGP)
international consortium announced on Tuesday the official launch
of the final phase of the human genome sequencing project, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project is to decipher the DNA code that makes
up the human body.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of HGP began in the United States in 1990 and
will finish by mid-June and produce a working draft -- 90 per cent
of human genome with an accuracy of 99.9 per cent.
</P>
<P>
HGP international consortium announced early this week that
international collaboration is now being directed to the second
phase to sequence the remaining DNA, fill the gaps in the sequence
and increase the overall sequence accuracy to 99.99 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The totality of all the DNA present in human cells is expected
in year 2003, to make what the consortium described as a "gold-
standard reference" for the identification of hereditary diseases.
</P>
<P>
China joined the project last July, becoming the sixth HGP
partner along with the United States, Britain, Japan, France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
By last month, China has deciphered the chromosomes that make
the human forearms, accounting for one per cent of the total HGP,
according to the Bio-engineering Development Center under the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, through the study of human genetics,
scientists can develop some new better therapies to treat breast
cancer, hereditary deafness, stroke, diabetes and other diseases.

<HEADLINE> N.Zealand Urged to Establish Ties With DPR Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Associate Foreign
Affairs Minister Matt Robson was Thursday quoted as saying New
Zealand should follow Australia's example and establish diplomatic
ties with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Australia restored diplomatic relations with the
DPRK after Italy resumed links with it in January.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted Robson as saying Wednesday that he would
suggest to Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister Phil Goff that New
Zealand follow suit.
</P>
<P>
"I think we should normalize relations as much as possible so
that we can have an influence on what will inevitably be changes
both in North Korea and eventually in South Korea as well," the
Wellington-based newspaper quoted Robson as saying.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, he continued, should do it because it would
contribute to world stability by ending the isolation of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for Goff said there are no plans to change New
Zealand's policy on the DPRK. The Dominion quoted the spokesman as
saying Australia was "re-establishing diplomatic ties with North
Korea, whereas New Zealand has never had them. There are no
immediate plans to follow the Australians, but we are watching it
quite closely."

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Rejects Aboriginal Reconciliation Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Thursday that he had rejected aspects of a historic
declaration of reconciliation between black and white Australia.
</P>
<P>
"Although there was significant agreement between the
government and the Council (for Aboriginal Reconciliation), in
several areas it has not been possible for the government to give
its full support to the document finally adopted by the council,"
Howard said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The areas of difference relate to customary law, the general
application of the laws of Australia to all citizens, self-
determination and a national apology as distinct from an
expression of sorrow and sincere regret," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard supported a parliamentary motion in August last year,
drafted with the help of Aboriginal Australian Democrats Senator
Aden Ridgeway, which expressed deep and sincere regret for
indigenous suffering without mentioning the word "sorry."
</P>
<P>
The council's document, shown to Howard last Friday, contains a
more direct apology than was contained in two earlier drafts.
</P>
<P>
"As we walk the journey of healing, one part of the nation
apologizes and expresses its sorrow and sincere regret for the
injustices of the past, so the other part accepts the apologies
and forgives," the document said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Howard also rejects the document's reference
to "recognize continuing customary laws, beliefs and tradition."
</P>
<P>
And he objects to a reference to indigenous people's right to
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
In a suggested alternative document, Howard calls for all
Australians to enjoy equal rights and to live under the same laws.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the government also had reservations about the
council's four national strategies to advance reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Philip Ruddock, minister assisting the prime minister for
reconciliation, said the reservations focused on the strategy to
promote recognition of indigenous rights over and above those
enjoyed by other Australians.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the objections have dashed hopes of the
parliament enshrining the Australian Declaration Towards
Reconciliation in law and making it a centerpiece on the centenary
of federation celebrations in January next year.
</P>
<P>
However, Howard and his government members will attend the
Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation's document launch at the
Sydney Opera House on May 27.

reserves fell by 3.5 million U.S. dollars to 18.26 billion dollars

<HEADLINE> North China to Return Farmland to Forests, Grassland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, May 11 (Xinhua) -- North China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region is to return 120,000 hectares of low-yield
farmland in 11 counties and banners along the Yellow River to
forest and pasture this year.
</P>
<P>
The central government will allocate more than 200 million yuan
(some 24 million U.S. dollars) to support the work, according to
regional government officials.
</P>
<P>
This is part of Inner Mongolia's efforts to implement the
central government's strategy to develop the vast underdeveloped
western region of the country. Improving the deteriorating
ecological system along the Yellow River is a priority of the
strategy.
</P>
<P>
The 11 counties and banners in Inner Mongolia will join another
160 in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province to
pioneer the ecological project for experiences for overall
environmental improvements in the entire upper and middle reaches
of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has listed seven autonomous regions and
provinces in the west for a huge project to plant trees and grass
in the upper and middle reaches of the river, the second longest
of the country known as part of the origin of the Chinese nation
and culture.
</P>
<P>
To implement the plan, the central government will allocate
over 4.7 billion yuan (about 564 million U.S. dollars) in ten
years for Inner Mongolia to return 800,000 hectares of low-yield
farmland to woods and grass and plant trees in 2.5 million
hectares, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments at various levels are working hard
to take care of farmers who give up their land for the
afforestation endeavor. According to the officials, the farmers
are satisfied with the government compensation of 1,500 kilos of
grain for each hectare of land, an amount they have never imagined
the poor land can yield.
</P>
<P>
Besides, local herdsmen will own the forest and grassland they
build. This policy is design to encourage more local people to
turn to forestry and animal husbandry for better profits.
</P>
<P>
The 29 Inner Mongolia counties and banners along the Yellow
River have long suffered water and soil erosion, contributing more
than 180 million tons of sand and mud to the river each year.

<HEADLINE> Roma Club Gets Bourse Listing OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 10 (Xinhua) -- AS Roma chairman Franco Sensi Thursday
brandished to fans the approval from Milan bourse watchdog Consob
of a bourse listing later this month, making it the second Italian
club to go public after city rival Lazio.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great day for Roma...a great success for the club
which is joining the bourse with massive financial assets that no
other club can boast," said Sensi.
</P>
<P>
The Roman club, which is fifth in Serie A with one game to go
and still has an outside chance of a place in next year's Champion
's League, already had small shareholders making up 15 percent of
its capital.
</P>
<P>
"In the future there will be more and more of them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The flotation will start on May 23, Sensi said, after an
official presentation on May 17 in Milan.
</P>
<P>
Many Serie A clubs including Inter, Milan, Parma, and (just
relegated to Serie B) Torino, have announced plans to follow in
Lazio's footsteps, but Roma has been the first to make the move.
</P>
<P>
Roma, which last won the championship in 1983 and boasts stars
like Italy's Francesco Totti and Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata, is two
points behind fourth-placed Inter and Parma. If it fails to rise
above one of them it will play in the UEFA Cup next year.

TIANJIN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- A dog who gave birth to puppies not
so long ago, looked after a baby tiger cub deserted by its mother.
</P>
<P>
The dog fed the cub every four hours and the baby tiger cub
grew from 1.5 kg to 2.2 kg in just three days.
</P>
<P>
This tiger refused to feed her own baby cubs last month. One of
them died on April 15. To save the other, the Tianjin Public
Security Bureau found a dog to care for the tiger cub.
</P>
<P>
Zookeepers said that they prepared high-protein food such as
chicken and fish soup. This tiger gave birth to another two babies
three days later. On this occasion, she readily looked after her
offspring.
</P>
<P>
The tiger was flown from Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province in
northwest China in 1998. She gave birth to three baby tiger cubs
last year. Only two of them survived.

<P>
WUHAN, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province has
been hit by severe drought, with more than one million hectares of
crops affected.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the worst-hit area is the
northwestern part of the province, where there has been only 70 mm
of rainfall since January.
</P>
<P>
The flow of water has stopped in many local rivers, more than
100,000 ponds have dried up, and there is less water in 1,000
major reservoirs in the province.
</P>
<P>
In the valley of the Hanjiang River, the largest tributary of

<HEADLINE> China's "Silicon Valley" Attracts High-Tech Firms with Preferential Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will simplified procedures
and lower the "threshold" for high-tech enterprises that hope to
set foot in the capital city's Zhongguancun Science and Technology
Park, known as China's "silicon valley."
</P>
<P>
Vice-Mayor Liu Zhihua said here Wednesday that registered
capital for setting up high-tech companies in the park will be as
low as 30,000 yuan, much lower than the 100,000 yuan to 500,000
yuan stipulated previously.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more overseas companies to set up high-tech
enterprises in the park, a series of preferential policies has
been mapped out, allowing overseas companies to register as home
enterprises even if their investment is below 25 percent of the
total registered capital of the enterprise. This is in sharp
contrast to the original policy that overseas enterprises are not
permitted to register if their investment is below that figure.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun has 66,000 enterprises. More than 1,000 involve
overseas investment.

"The problem in this case is strictly of agricultural
protectionism, and we are going to treat it in this way. We cannot
continue protecting inefficient production," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica started this week to demand zero percent of decay in
Nicaraguan agricultural products, mainly onions, that will enter
that country.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua applied immediately a similar treatment to Costa
Rican truck garden products and fruits, in response to the
measures taken by its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
According to Caldera, Nicaragua is much more efficient than
Costa Rica in the production of onions.
</P>
<P>
Caldera will meet Friday with his Costa Rican counterpart
Tomas Duenas in San Jose, Costa Rica, to try to find a solution to
the export of Nicaraguan onions.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges All Parties Not to Recruit Child Soldiers in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Sierra Leone has said that the
current crisis in the West African country could result in the
renewed recruitment of child soldiers, a practice that most
military leaders have repeatedly disavowed in the last two years,
the UNICEF said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We're very concerned right now about the threat to children,"
said Joanna Van Gerpen, the head of the UNICEF's office in Sierra
Leone, in the nation's capital Freetown Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The very high level of instability could lead us back into the
vicious cycle where children are used as tools of war," she said.
"This war is the business of adults -- children shouldn't be
forced to pay the price."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Sierra Leone Army, the paramilitary Civil
Defense Force, and the Armed Forces Ruling Council agreed to
disavow the practice of recruiting children as soldiers, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, although some members of the rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) have expressed support for the ban on child
soldiers, Foday Sankoh, the RUF leader, has not yet gone on record
as making this commitment, she said, adding that in Makeni, a town
in central Sierra Leone, RUF commanders had re-mobilized at least
40 former child soldiers and had attempted to re-enlist more.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF estimates that during Sierra Leone's nine-year civil
war, some 5,000 children -- mostly boys -- were used as combatants.
Thousands of other boys and girls were abducted and forced to
become wood gatherers, cooks, sex slaves or porters for the
military.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,700 former child combatants had been "demobilized"
since the signing of the Lome peace accord in July last year and
the commencement of the disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration program, she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF provides almost 2 million U.S. dollars each year in
financial and technical support to interim care centers where
former child soldiers are offered counseling, education,
recreation, and skills training opportunities while their families
are traced.
</P>
<P>
"The lives of hundreds of thousands of children have been
affected through constant displacement, disruption of their
schooling, exposure to traumatic events, loss of family members,
abduction and conscription into the fighting forces and continuous
violations of their basic human rights," she said. "Children in
this country have suffered enough."

MOSCOW, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions the Czech

<HEADLINE> CEPAL To Hold 2nd Regional Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Ricardo Lagos
and Jose Antonio Ocampo of the Economic Commission for Latin
American and the Caribbean (CEPAL) will open on May 15 the Social
Development Summit Follow-Up Second Regional Conference in this
capital.
</P>
<P>
A CEPAL communique published Thursday says that the meeting
will last until May 17 and will be held at the CEPAL installations
in Santiago, and will be attended by the representatives of some
Latin American countries and pertinent international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The advance in compliance with the plan of action of the Social
Development Summit held in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1995, when more
than 160 countries agreed on a plan to rescue the peoples from the
scourges of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, will be
reviewed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Jose Antonio Ocampo will present during the meeting the
document "The gap of fairness: a second evaluation," in which the
CEPAL makes an analysis of the situation in Latin America and the
Caribbean concerning the surmounting of poverty, the creation of
productive jobs, and the social integration, in the more extensive
context of the economic transformations and the reforms in the
social policy.
</P>
<P>
The CEPAL communique says that former Chilean President
Patricio Aylwin and the representatives of Chile, Mexico, Costa
Rica, and Jamaica, among other Latin American countries, as well
as those of some international and regional organizations, will
also speak at the meeting or will present their papers on the
corresponding topics.

<HEADLINE> Russia Concerned at Poor Security Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia said here Thursday
that all minorities ethnic groups are living in poor security
situation in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, and the U.N. Interim
Administration Mission (UNMIK) has to honor relevant Security
Council resolutions by fully respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Lavrov, the Russian permanent representative to the
United Nations, told an open Security Council meeting that "With
regard to the security situation in Kosovo, all the minority
representatives had stated that they felt unsafe."
</P>
<P>
"They also lack the freedom of movement, faced discrimination
in the job market and in access to health care," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorist acts continued, churches were being bombed and
killings carried out" in Kosovo, and the Security Council "must be
cautious about" UNMIK's statistics reflecting a falling crime rate
in the province.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council met in the open session to
discuss a report by the Security Mission which paid a visit to the
Serbian province. Lavrov was with the Mission to visit Kosovo on
April 28-29.
</P>
<P>
The eight-member mission was in Kosovo to see how the Security
Council resolution 1244 was implemented since the deployment of
UNMIK and the international peacekeeping force (KFOR) in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
"Since the deployment of UNMIK, 900 persons had been abducted,
" he said. "Arson, which numbered 10 instances per day also
attested to the fact that it was not a simple crime, but one
directed at an intimidation with clear political overtones."
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that UNMIK and KFOR could not guarantee the
universal security provided for in resolution 1244," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dominica Eliminates Voting Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dominican Republic Central
Electoral Board (JCE) announced Thursday that it will abstain
during the upcoming presidential elections from barring those who
have problems with the photographs in their identity cards from
casting their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Reports received in the Cuban capital said that this resolution
voids a previous one that impeded some 35,000 persons who had
different photographs in the voting roster and in the identity
card to cast their vote.
</P>
<P>
Now those 35,000 Dominicans will be able to vote if the
president, the secretary, and the second councilman of the
respective electoral colleges unanimously ratify their identity,
which eliminates the procedure of presenting another document to
demonstrate their identity.
</P>
<P>
Dominican President Leonel Hernandez said the JCE decision was
a wise one because it will permit electors to exert their right
without more difficulties in the elections to be held on May 16.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the candidates prepare the final actions of their
campaigns in Santo Domingo, where 32 percent of the little more
than four million electors of the country are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
Some polls show that opposition candidate Hipolito Mejia of the
Dominican Revolutionary Party is the favorite to win the elections,
followed by Danilo Medina of the ruling Dominican Liberation Party.
</P>
<P>
Those soundings of public opinion show that none of the
hopefuls will obtain 50 percent of the votes plus one, needed to
be elected president, so a second round of voting is expected on
June 30.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Thursday decided to hold a late evening debate on the hostage
crisis in Sierra Leone at the request of the African group of
states, diplomatic sources said here.
</P>
<P>
The debate will start at 8:00 p.m. EST, and Bernard Miyet, the
U.N. peacekeeping chief who just visited Sierra Leone, would not
be present at the open meeting, Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman,
announced.
</P>
<P>
Instead, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will attend the
Council meeting and make a statement, he said. But he did not
disclose the details of the statement.
</P>
<P>
A large number of countries were likely to attend the debate,
but no substantive decisions were expected, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was set for the late evening simply because the
morning and afternoon schedule was full. The Security Council met
in the morning on Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, and will meet in
the afternoon on the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the
conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Affordable AIDS Care Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discussions follow the call by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan to the private sector to respond to the AIDS crisis in
Africa where an estimated 23 million people are infected with HIV,
the virus causing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The companies involved in the dialogue are Boehringer Ingelheim,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo Wellcome, Merck &AMP; Co., Inc., and F.
Hoffmann-La Roche, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
On the U.N. side, the World Health Organization (WHO), the
World Bank, the U.N. Children's Fund and the U.N. Population Fund
are participants, he added. The announcement was made in Geneva
where the WHO is based.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. AIDS program official called the action something long
hoped for as it is the first time the companies are collectively
willing to discuss a truly significant decline in drug prices.
</P>
<P>
However, it could take time to make the new proposals
implemented, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The cost to quell the virus could fall to a perhaps 150-200 U.S.
dollars a month per patient from the current level of 800-1,000
dollars. But per capita income in Africa is less than 50 dollars a
month.
</P>
<P>
In addition to affordable drugs, health systems, delivery
capabilities and follow-up activities need to be improved to fight
AIDS successfully in the continent, Annan said Thursday in
response to the announcement.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Receives 75 Million Dollars in Credits From World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
two credits totaling 75 U.S. million dollars to assist Nigeria in
providing universal quality basic education and strengthening
economic management.
</P>
<P>
The 55-million-dollar Second Primary Education Project will
assist one of the top priorities of the government, which is to
improve the education system and provide universal basic education
for all.
</P>
<P>
The project will focus on training teachers and school managers
in approximately 1,000 schools throughout Nigeria, improve
physical learning conditions in 1,000 focus schools and 900 self-
help schools.
</P>
<P>
The total number of primary school age children in Nigeria is
about 19.5 million. Of this number, 15.7 million or 81 percent are
enrolled in 41,531 schools. The remaining 3.8 million are out of
schools.
</P>
<P>
The 20-million-dollar Economic Management Capacity Building
Project will support the federal government of Nigeria in
strengthening economic governance. The project will set the
foundation to build reforms in the civil service, legal, judicial,
procurement and tax policy areas, and in fiscal decentralization.
</P>
<P>
The two credits will be provided by the International
Development Association, the World Bank's concessional lending arm,
on standard terms of 35 years maturity, including 10 years grace.

<HEADLINE> Pound Hits Four-Year Low Vs U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Sterling dropped to its lowest level
against the U.S. dollar in four years Thursday, to below 1.50 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The pound also fell against the euro, one of which is now worth
60.86p -- the lowest level for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, sterling was scaling record highs against the
euro, but its strength has been a burden on manufacturers and was
cited by the Bank of England as a reason to refrain from raising
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Weakness of the euro has been causing the most problems in the
UK," said Steve Barrow, currency strategist at Bear Stearns in
London, noting that the U.S. had suffered much less damage from
the euro's protracted slide.
</P>
<P>
The pound's effect on manufacturing in the UK has been brought
into focus by BMW's recent sell-off of car maker Rover and Ford's
decision to slash jobs at its Dagenham plant, near London.
</P>
<P>
Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England, said
earlier this week that the strength of sterling against the euro
was "unsustainable."
</P>
<P>
"There could be a sharp correction at some point, but no one
has any idea about the extent or magnitude," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said King's comments may have helped to weaken the
pound, but they also served to boost the ailing euro, which
continues to languish near its all-time lows of last week.
</P>
<P>
But any recent upturns in the currency have usually been short-
lived, and Thursday was no exception, they added.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Bounce Back Strongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks bounced back
strongly Thursday as a slowing retail sales report raised hopes
that the tightening monetary policy by the Federal Reserve was
succeeding in slowing the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
178.19 at 10,545.97, rebounding from its losses of 235.85 points
in total Wednesday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was also up 114.85
at 3,499.58. The composite lost 432.09 points in the previous
three sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 24.76 at 1,407.81.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied as the Commerce Department reported that
retail sales unexpectedly fell 0.2 percent in April. Economists
had expected an increase of 0.4 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
The report eased fears of higher interest rates. But analysts
believed it will not make the Federal Reserve less aggressive in
raising rates.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist of Merrill Lynch, said in a
weekly survey that the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten by
50 basic points at the policymaking meeting on May 16. The central
bankers have raised rates five times since June in a pre-emptive
move to ward off inflation in the hot economy.
</P>
<P>
Intel, Texas Instruments and Micron Technology on the tech
sector were up. And on the industrial sector, rate-sensitive
stocks such as J.P. Morgan and Citigroup also rose.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.53 at 636.89 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 13.40 at 926.10. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 15.11 at 489.39.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a better than 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,028 up, 938 down and
443 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 947.40 million shares from 972.32
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> France Questions U.S. Plan to Deploy NMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The U.S. are the ones who can take the decisions that they
believe are appropriate in the context of their national security.
That is obvious," Vedrine told reporters after meeting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
But France does have questions, he added. "We do have a number
of questions to raise about the issue what you call here threats...
we would like the issues we raise to be taken into account in the
who decision-making process."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is due to decide whether the United
States should deploy a NMD system against threats from the so-
called "rogue" states. Such a project was opposed by Russia as
well as by some European allies of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Washington is persuading Moscow to change the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) Treaty signed in 1972 in order to clear the way for
NMD deployment. But Moscow rejected any changes to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that "what we are asking is that the consequences
and the effect on the global strategic situation and other
disarmament agreements be taken into account."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the president has not made a decision on NMD,
Albright noted that the United States is eager to brief and
consult with the European allies on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The president will be making a decision based on four criteria,
which are the level of the threat, the cost of the system, the
feasibility of the system, and its effect on general arms control
environment," she added.

<HEADLINE> Queen Opens Tate Modern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II
Thursday officially opened the Tate Modern -- the British art
gallery destined to become an international landmark.
</P>
<P>
The queen visited London's River Thames bankside for the
ceremony -- where she viewed exhibits and met artists, staff and
benefactors.
</P>
<P>
Hailed by critics as "A Cathedral of Cool," the 134 million
pound (205 million U.S. dollar) Tate Modern puts London at a
stroke alongside Paris and New York as a leading modern art
capital.
</P>
<P>
About 600 paintings and sculptures, from Matisse to Mondrian,
are housed in this museum which was transformed from a former
power station.
</P>
<P>
The original power station was built by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott,
architect of Liverpool's soaring Anglican Cathedral and designer
of Britain's distinctive red telephone box.
</P>
<P>
It has been transformed into a grandiose and sweeping art
gallery by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron.
</P>
<P>
Tate Modern will soon be linked across the River Thames near St
Paul's Cathedral by a new Millennium Bridge. The museum is
expected to attract two million visitors a year.
