TRACK TO INTRODUCE PRACTICE SESSIONS

<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ It's expensive to book track time at
Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Many teams hook up with other teams for midweek test sessions.
That generally leaves low-budget teams on the outside looking
in.However, the speedway and Legends Cars of California might have
found a way for those drivers to get non-race-day track time. On
Tuesday, the track and the Upland-based racing car company will
sponsor the first of six practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's twofold,'' track general manager Bob DeFazio said. ``It's
cost-effective for those who can't afford to test here and it's a
chance for someone who thinks they might want to go racing to give
it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the series that race at Irwindale, the Legends class
might be the best for rookie drivers; nearly everything on the car
is spec and competition on the third-mile oval is close, with
rookies frequently near or in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legend cars give the average guy a chance to drive a real race
car in competition and stay on a reasonable budget,'' competition
director Chris Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice session is from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., but nonracers
will have an opportunity to drive in an introductory program that
includes multiple laps between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. The cost for the
practice sessions, or introductory class, is $50. Pit passes are
$10.
</P>
<P>
   The other Legend Tuesdays are Sept. 5 and 26, Oct. 3 and 24 and
Nov. 11.
</P>
<P>
   __ Long season: Baseball has its dog days of summer and so do
speedways.
</P>
<P>
   Money, vacations and broken cars have an effect on car counts.
But Morgan says he's pleased with this year's fields. Saturday
night had 92 cars entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up 20 percent,'' Morgan said. ``Last year, we had 17 or
18 Super Late Models at this point and (on Saturday), we have 27.
If they weren't running Super Late Models at Cajon and Mesa Marin
(Speedways), we'd easily have more than 30 cars.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Acronym confusion: So, what is it, CMC or CMC?
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, Canyon Country's Tommy Fry had won two
consecutive Super Late Model races at Irwindale for CMC. Car owner
Ed Doyle owns Chatsworth Machine Company and Competition Machining
Center, both separate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created unnecessary confusion,'' Doyle admitted.
</P>
<P>
   So from now on, Doyle, who won the SLM title with Rod Johnson as
his driver, will be racing for Chatsworth Machine Company.

Bull riders pay tribute to Bodacious' past
<TEXT>
<P>
   By SCOTT KAISER
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Bull-riding competitions are pretty much worthless
without good bulls, and there was none better than Bodacious.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of Bodacious, who died May 16 of kidney failure, is
such that a tribute in his honor was part of Saturday's Justin Bull
Riding Championship at Compaq Center. The six men _ out of 135
career riders _ who lasted eight seconds on the 1,800-pound
crossbreed Charbray bull were in attendance for a video tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's most dangerous bull'' was not only notorious for
his assaults on bull riders but became a multimedia star as well.
Bodacious is the only bull to have an agent and his own line of
merchandise, and a feature video of his exploits became a
bestseller. He was inducted into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the baddest bull there has ever been,'' said Tuff
Hedeman, president of Professional Bull Riders Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman is one of the six who earned points on Bodacious, but he
also needed reconstructive surgery after getting his face smashed
by the bull in 1995. Hedeman drew Bodacious again at an event later
that year and refused to ride him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart would drop when you saw your name next to his,''
said Montana's Clint Branger, who scored a remarkable 92 on
Bodacious in 1995. ``He weighed close to 2,000 pounds but moved
like a linebacker in the NFL. He was so big and athletic, and to be
able to jump and drop and still have all that power with it, he was
just incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something for me to say that I rode that bull. I didn't
sleep for two nights after I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious, originally called J31, came to prominence in the
early 1990s as champion bull riders were routinely thrown to the
ground, many seriously injured. In addition to his distinctive
coloring that earned him the nickname ``Yellow Whale,'' Bodacious
made unique moves that never before had been seen and left riders
defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1994 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, Bodacious used his
patented head-snapping move that resulted in life-threatening
injuries to Terry Don West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end (of his career), he had a deal where he set you
up and smacked you,'' Branger said. ``He got smart and had a move
where he would rear up and throw the rider over the front and then
smack him with his head, and it would mutilate them. If they hadn't
retired him, he eventually would have killed somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bodacious injured Scott Breding in late 1995, owners Sammy
and Carolyn Andrews retired the bull ``in the interest of cowboy
safety.'' Since Bodacious' death, his legacy has been kept alive by
Buckers Inc. through its distribution of Bodacious' semen as part
of a move to breed better bucking stock.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious' tradition was held up in Saturday's opening round as
only 18 of 46 riders completed their rides. Justin McBride, who
turns 21 on Monday, stole the show by posting the night's best
score of 90 on Lisa's Pet and then earned an additional $30,000 by
riding Rampage for 8.7 seconds in the Mossy Oak Shootout. McBride
was the first man in a year to complete a ride on the bull
considered today's Bodacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Rampage) is the baddest bull going (right now), but that's
the kind of challenge I crave,'' said McBride, who picked up
$15,000 earlier this season in another shootout. ``If you want to
try and be the best at what you're doing, you have to match
yourself against the best.''
</P>
<P>
   The 46 competitors have a second ride today beginning at 2 p.m.,
and then the top 15 _ based on the average of the first two rounds
_ get another ride as they vie for a first-prize purse of $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was great, but it's over now,'' McBride said. ``I have
to get after them again (today).''

E.Y. IS NOT OK WITH JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Chicago Cubs are coming to Dodger Stadium for
the first time this season Monday, but it's best to hold off on any
plans for that lovefest between Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson and ex-Dodger Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers traded Young to the Cubs during the offseason along
with right-hander Ismael Valdes, recently reborn a Dodger. Don't
look for Young to don Dodger Blue again, though, not as long as
Johnson is around and Young keeps firing verbal shots.
</P>
<P>
   Young was at it again, this time down in San Diego, where the
Cubs played a three-game series against the Padres. Young told the
Chicago Sun- Times he and Johnson did not speak when the teams
first met this season in Wrigley, only exchanged glares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make a move to apologize,'' Young said. ``If
he wants to make amends or something like that, I have no problem
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson maintains he liked Young and had no problems with him,
but Young said too many times the manager's private comments
criticizing his defense at second and leadoff ability have come
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done it before with me last season in front of the
team,'' Young said. ``But what ticks me off about the latest
episode is that he was continually bad-mouthing me after the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once the trade was done, there should have been no
more talk about it by him. So it was time for me to come out with
my side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said part of his problem with the Dodgers was the L.A.
media tended to side with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were pro-Davey, so they had to write positive about
him,'' he said. ``Some would write the facts and those were the
guys who were pro- E.Y.''
</P>
<P>
   __ And now, leading off: Young is batting .300 for Chicago and
giving the Cubs the kind of leadoff hitter the Dodgers were so
desperate for this season that last week they traded for another
ex- Dodger, Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, who spent part of three seasons with the Dodgers after
coming up through their organization, on Friday made his first
start at Chavez Ravine as a Dodger since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you come to a new team, you have butterflies,''
Goodwin said. ``I can't tell you if I had any more because it was
coming back here. I didn't lose my lunch, so I guess it wasn't too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a platoon, sort of: Alex Cora has essentially taken over
the starting shortstop job from Kevin Elster. Or at least he's
being given the chance at it.
</P>
<P>
   Cora has started the past four games at short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a platoon,'' Johnson said. ``Left-handers are
off for Cora right now. I'm trying to get him comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: F.P. Santangelo served the third day of his
five-game suspension for his involvement in the incident with fans
at Wrigley Field back in May. . . . Right-hander Kevin Brown's
sacrifice bunt Friday night was his 11th of the season, tying him
with Atlanta's Kevin Millwood for the second most in the majors. .
. . The Dodgers' annual Hollywood Stars game, which once boasted
A-list stars like Frank Sinatra, Kirk Douglas and Dean Martin,
featured a mostly B lineup Saturday that included Carlos Alazarqui,
that noted voice of the Taco Bell Dog.

   MISSION -A veteran copper miner and his family told federal
regulators for months about unsafe conditions at an underground
mine near Tucson, but the complaints were ignored and the miner
died in a rock-fall this year. An (beginitalic)Arizona Republic
(enditalic)investigation, based on interviews with miners, union
officials, regulators and documents obtained through state and
federal public records requests, found that federal inspectors
repeatedly failed to follow up on complaints of dangerous
conditions at Asarco Inc.'s Mission Mine. Story will move in the
``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   POWER -It was supposed to deliver lower electric rates and a
stable source of power. But for Californians, electricity
deregulation has brought soaring power bills and rolling blackouts.
It's a situation not unlike Arizona's, where, due to unprecedented
growth and limited resources, utilities such as Arizona Public
Service Co. and Salt River Project must now increasingly import
electricity to meet demand. Story will move in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   GOP -For all that went right for the Republicans last week,
history says it's too early to take comfort in polls, which now
give Texas Gov. George W. Bush a double-digit lead over the
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Al
Gore. Story will move in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   SEDONA -Five months after calling a halt to his presidential
campaign against a backdrop of Sedona's Red Rocks, John McCain may
be showing the spectacular scenery to the man who beat him. Story
will move in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   MONTINI-COL -I try to picture the moment when the man gave the
woman his telephone number. Maybe it was at a bar and the light
wasn't good. Or maybe he was behind her in line at a coffee shop
and scribbled it on a napkin. Whatever happened, when she finally
got up the nerve to call him, she reached the wrong answering
machine. Mine. By E.J. MONTINI. Column will move in the ``K''
category.
</P>
<P>
   ROBB {ndash} COLUMN (Philadelphia) --Is it possible that George
W. Bush, allegedly an underachiever most of his adult life, will
become the most transforming president since Franklin Delano
Roosevelt? That's the ambition he set forth, in the images and
messages carefully projected during the meticulously choreographed
convention, and in his acceptance speech. By ROBERT ROBB. Column
will move on the ``K'' wire.
</P>
<P>
   WILLEY {ndash} COLUMN (Philadelphia) - For sheer
``pleasantness,'' last week's Republican National Convention in
Philadelphia was more enjoyable than others in recent memory. It
was very politically correct. It was also very politically dull. By
KEVEN ANN WILLEY. Column will move on the ``K'' wire.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA REPUBLIC {ndash} EDITORIAL (Philadelphia) -The last time
there was an open seat for the presidency was 1988. Michael Dukakis
emerged from the Democratic National Convention with a 17-point
lead, yet failed to wrest the office away from the Republican
standard-bearer that year, a vice president named, ironically
enough, George Bush. Twelve years later and it's an open seat
again. George W. Bush just emerged from the Republican National
Convention here with a lead, at least in some polls on Friday,
approaching 19 percentage points over the Democratic
standard-bearer, a vice president named Al Gore. Is that where the
analogy ends? ARIZONA REPUBLIC. Editorial will move on the ``K''
wire.

SOLID ATTACK PROVES POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution finally have assembled a team
that can match the Columbus Crew's athleticism and speed. But even
the Revolution's second-half improvement in Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's game
was not enough as they played to a 1-1 tie with the Crew and remain
in ninth place, 1 point behind Dallas, in the race for the final
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes of regulation, the Revolution forced their
opponents back and kept them off balance with their aggression and
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Crew scored the first goal, on an impressive free kick
by Robert Warzycha that goalkeeper Juergen Sommer had no chance to
stop in the 85th minute. A first-half header by the Crew's Brian
McBride was nullified on a questionable offside call.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution pressure paid off. They were denied a penalty
kick when Johnny Torres went down in the goal area in the 80th
minute, then tied the score when Wolde Harris finished a William
Sunsing cross in the 88th.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Sunsing and Torres, who replaced an effective
but tiring Jose Luis Morales, added dynamism to the Revolution's
attack.
</P>
<P>
   New England concluded the match with eight players age 24 or
younger. The Revolution played with the defensive-minded midfield
of Joe Franchino, John Harkes, and Carlos Parra, with Imad Baba and
Jamar Beasley on the wings. Sunsing replaced Baba in the 60th
minute and ignited the attack, nearly providing a dramatic clincher
when his 91st-minute drive from 35 yards bounced off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's three-man defense _ Rusty Pierce, Mauricio
Wright, and Brian Dunseth _ displayed cohesion and an
uncompromising attitude. They were also fortunate that McBride's
first-half goal was disallowed and a Dunseth handball was ruled
outside the penalty area by referee Noel Kenny in the 56th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first goal was not offside and Noel probably knows he
didn't have a good game,'' Columbus coach Tom Fitzgerald said.
``But everyone is human.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo was less understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would say this,'' Clavijo said. ``But my
enjoyment for the game is going away. It's frustrating because it
was not Columbus that stopped us from getting another 2 points. It
is tough to fight against a pretty good team and fight against
other forces, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I talked about the referee it cost me $2,000.
But if you look at it, we could have had an extra 2 points against
Miami, too. It's very hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Torres appeared to have drawn a penalty in the final
minute of a 1-1 tie against Miami April 29. But the referee _ Kenny
_ denied the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two players together holding each other and both went
down,'' Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Torres disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He apologized to me before this game for the last (non-call)
and I said, `Don't worry about it, but don't let it happen again,'
'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution expected to capitalize on playing seven of their
final nine games at home. But this was their first home point since
a 3-0 win over San Jose June 10. The Revolution, who visit the
MetroStars next week, have 33 points in 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   At least this was one of the few times the Revolution appeared
capable of imposing their game on Columbus. They have only two
3-point victories in 19 games, 8 points of a possible 57, and a
33-15 goal deficit against the Crew since 1996.

Alou deserves better treatment
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If you went by looks alone, Moises Alou would be the
anti-Lima _ a slow, solemn drumbeat of a man compared to Jose
Lima's bouncy Latin beat.
</P>
<P>
   He is dour in a world of pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   But if you went by looks alone _ and haven't most Astros fans
and wannabe experts when it comes to Mo Baseball? _ Alou would be
in New York today. Or Boston. Or anywhere but here, where style
sometimes seems to matter more than production and the world seems
to revolve around slidesteps and retractable roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Lima started the year 1-13 but received rousing ovations. The
Astros dropped 10 games, 15 games, 20 games out of first place in a
season that once held so much promise, but the company line
continued to be, ``Isn't it just great to be playing outdoors?''
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Mo was perceived as less.
</P>
<P>
   For all his long, loping strides in the outfield and flyballs
bouncing in front of him, Alou was looked at like some kind of
Derek Bell without the lime-green alligator loafers.
</P>
<P>
   For all his stone-faced stares, slow walks to the dugout and
noticeable absences from playoff games gone by, Mo was traded by
Monday morning executives more often than Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when all you do is produce without flash. Such is
life when you wear your emotions in your heart, not your sleeve and
loyalty becomes a four-letter word.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to give the man a break. And his due.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to become the scapegoat when this Astros season was
blown to smithereens, but how it became Alou might be the saddest
twist to a season so sad Enron Field should be draped in black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it hurt to hear all the things fans have said about
me,'' Alou said. ``People think I'm lazy or I don't care. I could
have easily left this team.''
</P>
<P>
   At least twice, Alou was offered the opportunity to accept a
trade to a contending team this year, guaranteeing himself a chance
to perhaps win another World Series ring to match the one he earned
with the Marlins. But both times when the trade was offered, Alou
showed something that beloved former Astros like Darryl Kile and
Mike Hampton did not.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the boos and catcalls only continued, confounding those who
know what ticks in Alou's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation last year in the playoffs (against Atlanta) when
he wasn't with the team really affected how people look at him,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``It was vastly overplayed. But
ever since, some people look at him and they might see something
that's not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an air of royalty about him. He maintains a quiet
demeanor, sort of like an inner competitiveness. That can be a good
thing in baseball. That type of a personality can keep you in good
stead in this game for a long time. But it also can be
misinterpreted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Alou's explanation of his playoff absence last year can be
interpreted like some kind of aloofness, or cockiness: ``Being a
player of my caliber, to sit and watch knowing that if I was out
there I probably could have done better than the guys in the
outfield, I didn't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a blunt, biting explanation. But is it wrong? With a pair
of doubles in Saturday night's 10-9 loss to the Expos, Alou raised
his batting average to .353, with 17 home runs and 61 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of Richard Hidalgo, Jeff Bagwell or Scott
Elarton being the team Most Valuable Player this season, has anyone
mentioned Alou?
</P>
<P>
   It must be the staid demeanor. It must be the scary stare and
the seriousness of his style.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people that are afraid to come up to me and
ask me a question or say hello,'' Alou said. ``I'm not a Mr. Smiley
Guy. People feel like I'm angry, but I'm not. That's one thing I'd
like to change about myself. If I'm at a restaurant or out
somewhere, people avoid me. They don't approach me. I hear people
saying, `Hey, why don't you smile?'''
</P>
<P>
   But it's time to give the man a break. Some people show a lot of
flash and little production. Mo Baseball only keeps producing _ and
wanting to play in Houston, which, strangely, few have appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have easily gone somewhere else this year and I could
have gone (after) '98, also,'' Alou said. ``I don't always know
what the fans are thinking. In this game, there's not a lot of
loyalty. I told myself, `I can take this (trade) and go win right
now.' But my No. 1 concern is to be happy. I want to feel that
happiness and peace about where I am. Right now, I like the
players, the coaches, the bat boys, everybody.''

<P>
   It's time for fans and would-be critics to quit trying to say
goodbye to Mo and start saying hello.

JUDAH TKO'S MILLETT

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ Terronn Millett's championship reign went
into permanent recess Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Millett had once been the International Boxing Federation junior
welterweight champion but was declared champion in recess after he
broke his left hand in his first defense and was unavailable to
defend against No. 1 challenger Zab Judah last December.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the IBF allowed Judah to fight Jan Bergman for the
vacated title and then named him interim champion, with Millett
still in recess until he entered the ring Saturday &UR;  &LR; night with his
entourage carrying the belt he felt was still his because no one
had beaten it out of his hands.
</P>
<P>
   He felt that way until 2:47 of the fourth round when the last of
his three trips to the canvas at the Uncasville Pavilion at the
Mohegan Sun Casino set off the sound of bells in his head that
signaled recess was over and now permanent for Millett.
</P>
<P>
   Two solid left hands sent Millett reeling sideways before he
finally fell to the floor. He got up quickly but just as quickly
went down again from another left from Judah, and this time he was
wobbling badly when he rose to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me with a nice shot,'' Millett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take my hat off to him. He's quick and he's got a lot of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Michael Ortega watched Millett closely for several
seconds before asking him to walk forward. When he did and his
equilibrium was clearly still off, Ortega wasted no time in
signaling that the fight was over.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome had been clear long before Ortega's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Judah (24-0, 18 KO's) opened fast and his speed advantage was
obvious from the outset, but just as he seemed to have Millett in
trouble, the 32-year-old former champion nailed him with a body
shot that sent Judah to the floor. Judah seemed stunned at this
occurrence and could think of only one response.
</P>
<P>
   He got up and went after Millett.
</P>
<P>
   Twice he nailed Millett with solid right hands that seemed to
stun the champion from recess almost into a lunch break, but they
did not put him into permanent recess until midway through the
second round, when a sudden Judah left caught Millett right on the
chin again and floored him.
</P>
<P>
   He was up quickly, but it was too quick for his own good as
Judah strafed him with several more bombs.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Millett had no real answer for Judah's hand speed, and
his eyes began to blink noticeably in the third round as Judah
started to pepper him with his right jab and a long left behind it.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Judah began to taunt Millett, moving his body
from side to side, shaking his shoulders and dangling his tongue
out at him as his mentor, Pernell Whitaker, so often had done to
his many victims.
</P>
<P>
   One round later, the taunting stopped and the tattooing began
anew, but this time it didn't last long before the bell tolled for
Millett.
</P>
<P>
   When it did, recess was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the king,'' Judah said. ``If anybody wants to be IBF
champion they have to beat Zab Judah. What I learned tonight is I'm
the real champion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the semi-main event, Juan Lazcano (24-2-1) won a split
decision from former World Boxing Council super featherweight
champion Jesse James Leija.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William Hutt had Leija (40-5-2, 16 KO's) winning, 96-94,
while Fred Ucci had the same score in the opposite direction.
Stephen Weisfield had Lazcano winning seven of the last eight
rounds in the 10-round bout for a 97-93 advantage that gave Lazcano
his close victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it all,'' Leija said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the underdog coming in. I can't do anything about the
judges.''

DODGERS MISS CHANCES, FALL IN 10TH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Milwaukee Brewers can't seem to figure out
their designated role in this weekend's little get together with
the Los Angeles Dodgers, but major-leaguers tend to have this
aversion to being labeled a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers need to get some momentum going, need some
comparatively easy wins, but the Brewers keep playing them tough
and messing up their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the Brewers played them tough enough for a 4-2
victory in 10 innings, when light-hitting catcher Henry Blanco hit
a two-run homer off Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodger Stadium crowd of 42,580 saw the Dodgers fail to pick up
a game on both the Giants and Diamondbacks in the NL West. L.A.
remains 2 games behind division leader San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters (4-2) and Juan Acevedo (2-4) reversed roles from Friday
night's game, this time Acevedo picking up the win and Fetters the
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson normally doesn't pitch Fetters on
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to the time of year, I don't consider anybody
unavailable,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters started the 10th getting two quick outs, before Jose
Hernandez looped a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco, batting .222, then jumped on Fetters' first pitch for
his sixth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Both starting pitchers _ the Dodgers' Chan Ho Park and the
Brewers' Jeff D'Amico _ were long gone by the time the game broke
into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, the 6-foot-7 right-hander who missed all of the 1998
season following shoulder surgery, was an odd puzzle for the
Dodgers throughout most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   A big man who doesn't try to overpower hitters, he kept the
Dodgers off-balance with slow curves and change-ups.
</P>
<P>
   When he did start Gary Sheffield with a fastball in the fourth
inning, however, he regretted it in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield originally came up with the Brewers _ the only team in
the majors he hadn't homered against.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield jumped on D'Amico's fastball and delivered it several
rows into the left-field pavilion. It was his 35th home run of the
season, giving him back the major-league lead.
</P>
<P>
   That tied the score at 1-1, the Brewers having taken the early
lead when former USC Trojan Geoff Jenkins homered off Chan Ho Park
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' 20th home run of the season was a line shot to right
that almost left the park before the sound of the hit could be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   After Sheffield tied the game up in the fourth, Jenkins put the
Brewers back on top with a second solo home run off Park in the
sixth, this time going to left. It was his first multihomer game of
the season, and the second of his career.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, the NL Pitcher of the Month in July when he went 5-0
with a 0.76 ERA in six starts, was making the 2-1 lead hold up
through six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked him,'' Johnson said. ``He's never been real
consistent in the past, but he's locating now and that's why he's
been winning.''
</P>
<P>
   He located one a tad poorly against Shawn Green in the seventh.
Green powered his 19th home run of the season to center and the
game was again tied, this time at 2-2 on four solo home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Park left for a pinch hitter after six innings. He allowed the
two runs on six hits, walked three (one intentionally) and struck
out eight.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, who hasn't lost since June 5, also left without a
decision. He went eight innings, allowing his two runs on five
hits. He walked one and struck out a career high eight.

<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Did Jerry Toliver's chance at upending John
Force's Funny Car reign end Saturday when he failed to qualify for
today's Fram Autolite Nationals?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, says nine-time NHRA champion Force, who could
take a sizable advantage in the points race if he is able to win
today's national event at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``One race doesn't mean anything,'' said Force, who could take
over the points lead by winning a first-round matchup against
veteran Tommy Johnson Jr. ``Does Toliver not qualifying help us?
Does it motivate us? Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't do anything exciting here but qualify. Toliver
didn't qualify, so that makes us feel like we did something. But we
have to take our runs now and try to win a drag race.''
</P>
<P>
   Toliver doesn't seem to be too concerned either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't qualify,'' said Toliver, who could go no quicker
then 5.316 before being bumped out of the 16-car field by Dale
Creasy Jr. ``We still have nine events to go (after Sunday) and
have plenty of time left to make up any ground we lose (today).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early in the third quarter and we have to go into the
next race (in two weeks at Brainerd, Minn.) and continue on. We're
staying focused on the grand prize and we're not about to let one
race prevent us from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Force will give it a good try today. The Bell Gardens native is
not the No. 1 qualifier, but he's been the most consistent here,
qualifying second with a 5.005 and backing it up Saturday with a
pair of 5.02s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got a shot at winning this race,'' Force said.
``The car's been really consistent. But what we need to do is just
focus first round. Whit Bazemore was No. 1 qualifier at Seattle,
then smokes the tires first round. So we need to really focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore could challenge Force after his Friday pass of 4.955
held up, earning him his third consecutive pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great run (Friday),'' said Bazemore, who faces
Creasy in the first round. ``We have a tough competitor in Dale
Creasy Jr., and as we showed last week in Seattle, every round is a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Today should also be a challenge in Top Fuel, where Gary Scelzi
leads a host of drivers who made two solid passes over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This racetrack isn't going to hold much,'' said Scelzi, who
qualified No. 1 for the seventh time this season with a solid 4.634
at 310.98 mph. ``It's pretty iffy. I believe you're going to have
to run low (4.70s) to get to the end of this deal. It's going to be
a crew chief and driver's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Which could play into the hands of Doug Kalitta, who ran a 4.657
Saturday to place second in qualifying. La Habra native Bob
Vandergriff Jr. remained third with a 4.666. Vandergriff faces Gary
Clapshaw in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Amato nearly suffered the same fate at Toliver. But the
five-time Top Fuel champion, who was unqualified after three
rounds, made the 16-car field with a steady 4.753 pass in
Saturday's final session.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not very strong, but it got us in the show,'' said
Amato, who faces Tony Schumacher in today's first round.

DODGERS LOSE IN 10th 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Milwaukee Brewers can't seem to figure out
their designated role in this weekend's little get-together with
the Los Aneles Dodgers, but major-leaguers tend to have this
aversion to being labeled a pushover.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers need to get some momentum going, need some
comparatively easy wins, but the Brewers keep playing them tough
and messing up their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night the Brewers played them tough enough to come away
with a 4-2 victory in 10 innings, when light-hitting catcher Henry
Blanco hit a two-run homer off reliever Mike Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   A Dodger Stadium crowd of 42,580 saw the Dodgers miss an
opportunity to pick up ground on the Giants and Diamondbacks in the
NL West. They both lost, but the Dodgers remain 2 back of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Brewers, who entered the game 20-34 on the
road, 45-64 overall and 14 games back in the NL Central. And
wouldn't play the patsy.
</P>
<P>
   Not with Geoff Jenkins hitting a pair of solo home runs off Chan
Ho Park, who otherwise pitched a strong six innings. And certainly
not with baseball's unexpected pitching sensation, Jeff D'Amico,
holding the Dodgers to a pair of solo home runs from Gary Sheffield
(his major-league leading 35th) and Shawn Green (his 19th) in his
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a good, young team,'' Green said. ``They're
obviously building for next year when they get their new stadium.
They're just out playing, having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, at the Dodgers' expense Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters and Juan Acevedo reversed roles from Friday night's
game, this time Acevedo (2-4) picking up the late win and Fetters
(4-2) the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson normally doesn't pitch Fetters on
consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting to the time of year, I don't consider anybody
unavailable,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fetters started the 10th well enough, before Jose Hernandez
looped a single to right for his third hit.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco, who also threw out three would-be base stealers, took
his .222 batting average to the plate and jumped on Fetters' first
pitch for his sixth home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Park and D'Amico were long gone by the time the Dodgers entered
their 10th extra-inning game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, the 6-foot-7 right-hander who missed all of the 1998
season following shoulder surgery, was an odd puzzle for the
Dodgers throughout the night. A big man who doesn't try to
overpower hitters, he kept the Dodgers off-balance with slow curves
and change-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize that's the best pitcher in the National
League over the last month,'' Eric Karros said. ``It's not about
how hard you throw, it's about mixing it up and keeping hitters
guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   When D'Amico did start Sheffield off with a fastball in the
fourth inning, however, he regretted it in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield originally came up with the Brewers _ the only team in
the majors of the 29 he had faced that he hadn't homered against.
Until Saturday, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield jumped on D'Amico's fastball and delivered it several
rows into the left-field pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins had given the Brewers a 1-0 lead in the first when he
homered to right off Park. After Sheffield tied it, Jenkins gave
Milwaukee the lead back with his second solo shot _ this one to
left in the sixth _ his 21st of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically out of the pennant race at this point, so
we're playing the spoiler role,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico made one more poor pitch, when Green tied the game with
his solo home run the seventh.

 &HT;    Beyond speeches and balloons
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Those who thought this year's Republican
convention would be the same ol', same ol' were proven wrong from
opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the demographic makeup of the delegates,
they rocked to African and Latino rhythms and listened to the
nephew of the candidate address them in two languages _ the English
of his father and the Spanish of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   They might not have liked everything they heard, but this
convention had a different tone to it. The event that signaled the
change in tone was the impassioned speech Colin Powell delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf
War, dropped a rhetorical bomb on the delegates by telling them
some things they probably didn't want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must understand, my friends, the cynicism that exists in
the black community. The kind of cynicism that is created when, for
example, some in our party miss no opportunity to roundly and
loudly condemn affirmative action that helped a few thousand black
kids get an education, but you hardly hear a whimper from them over
affirmative action for lobbyists who load our federal tax codes
with preferences for special interests,'' Powell said to applause.
``It doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable performance considering that Powell was
booed at the 1996 GOP convention when he marshalled the same
defense of affirmative action. It was a testament, perhaps, of a
realization that politics is ultimately about numbers and where
those numbers are now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's declaration to the convention was a challenge, not only
to the GOP delegates assembled in Philadelphia, but also to
Democrats and other political parties who will only survive if they
reach beyond their traditional constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the party's presidential nominee, won
unprecedented support from African American and Hispanic
constituencies in his home state by ignoring ethnic and racial
political boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Though skeptics will argue that's all symbolic, the fact remains
that the only minority statewide candidates on the Texas ballot
this year were Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Guess Democrats couldn't find anyone qualified.
</P>
<P>
   When they meet later this month, Democrats will be challenged to
put on their version of outreach and they are going to have to go
some to match the show in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just politics. Who gets elected and appointed to
whatever directly benefits a very few in the political class. To
get to the issues that effect people, neither party has much room
to brag.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear politicians in either party talking much about
diabetes _ just to cite one example. This killer, however, touches
15 million lives in the United States _ 5 million of whom don't
even know they have it, according to National Institute of Health
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   There are 789,000 new cases of diabetes reported every year. In
1998, the last year for which statistics are available, the price
tag for diabetes was $98 billion _ $44 million in direct costs of
treatment and the balance in indirect costs that include lost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes hits women more often than men, but hits especially
hard in minority communities. According to the health institute,
one in 10 Mexican Americans are diabetics as are one in 10 non
Hispanic blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Complications from diabetes are ugly as well as deadly. Diabetes
can lead to strokes, blindness, kidney failure, heart attack and
loss of limbs. A high profile example was the legendary songtress
Ella Fitzgerald, who lost both her legs and then her life to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who want to talk about compassion can include some
words about funding for research, about access to information and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one way of connecting with real concerns of real
people and a good way of letting folks know that politics can be
more than speeches and balloons.

 &HT;    The handwriting may be on the wall, but can you read it?
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Did anyone else find it ironic that when
President Clinton signed the electronic signature bill into law, he
used a felt-tipped pen? I, for one, am concerned about signatures
with the power to purchase stock and sell houses floating out in
space _ cyber or otherwise. I am in the minority _ the same
minority that prefers receiving canceled checks, not photocopies in
a bank statement.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting develops fine motor skills. Research at the
University of Washington reveals that the creative process is
enhanced by the mechanical process of handwriting. But alas! Forces
such as the keyboard, the pager and the telephone are conspiring to
make communicating by picking up a pen a less-attractive option.
</P>
<P>
   As a big fan of personal correspondence, this disturbs me. I
like the sensual feel of stationery (Cranes to Pineider) and pens
(fountain to felt) as well as the slower pace of handwriting a
letter. And, yes, I am a lousy typist.
</P>
<P>
   But just knowing how to write is not enough _ it must be
legible, too. Take the misread draft on a Canadian bank account
this May resulting in an $8,000 error, or worse, the doctor whose
poor penmanship cost a patient his life.
</P>
<P>
   Hark back to those tedious exercises on the tri-ruled paper in
third grade. Remember that the girls were always better at this
than the boys? Only an Einstein, pupils were told, could get by
with poor penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the big deal about handwriting in the electronic age?
Can it reveal personality traits? Zero in on the composer of the
JonBenet ransom note? Did you realize some companies use
handwriting analysis as part of the hiring process?
</P>
<P>
   If you love putting pen to paper, then this edition of the Greig
Files will validate the importance of continuing to write by hand.
If you rely on your spell-checker and a keyboard, then this edition
will teach you much about the art of handwriting _ from scratch, so
to speak.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE DID WRITING BEGIN?
</P>
<P>
   The journey from lines in the sand to shorthand and e-mail is a
long one.
</P>
<P>
   Sumerian tribes employed pictograms (about 3500 B.C.), stylized
repof actions, called ideograms (sleep, for example, was
represented by a drawing of a prone person). A little like charades
on paper. Abstract symbols representing sounds rather than objects
or actions enhanced written communication. This writing, known as
cuneiform (Latin, meaning ``wedge''), was written with a
wedge-shaped stylus or pen on clay tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Egyptians (about 3100 B.C.) developed
hieroglyphic writing to annotate religious scenes adorning tombs
and chapels. The Chinese developed pictorial script. The
Phoenicians (2000 B.C.) created symbols with phonetic values.
Voila, the alphabet. This greatly simplified writing.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know more about the history of scribble? Pick up a copy
of ``Panati's Browser's Book of Beginnings'' by Charles Panati.
</P>
<P>
   IS BAD PENMANSHIP A STATUS SYMBOL?
</P>
<P>
   The ability to write legibly has gone in and out of fashion.
Royalty at one time disdained writing. Who needs to write when you
have serfs as scribes and pedestrian merchants to keep track of
wheat bushels and cattle herds? Later, only the educated could read
and write. Clergy devoted lifetimes to copying and embellishing the
Scriptures, priding themselves on perfection. Copies of the Torah
must be error-free.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, penmanship classes were all the rage. Good
handwriting was a sign of breeding and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Penmanship is still part of the grade-school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   WHO NEEDS GOOD HANDWRITING?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone does.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the electronic age, handwriting is appropriate for a
variety of situations. Thank-you notes (yes, many people still pen
them) as well as correspondence of an intimate nature such as
condolence notes, and oh, yes, love letters. Remember Ronald
Reagan's touching letter sharing his Alzheimer's diagnosis with the
nation? Would it have been as heart-wresting if it had been a typed
letter?
</P>
<P>
   Also, handwritten annotated drafts of literary works are much
more interesting than typed drafts.
</P>
<P>
   IS YOUR LIFE AN OPEN BOOK?
</P>
<P>
   To a graphologist, it may be.
</P>
<P>
   A graphologist studies the characteristics of handwriting and
deduces personality traits from the sample. A parlor game? Maybe,
but not to graphologist Sandra Lynn of Personality Profiles Plus.
Individuals and couples seek out Lynn's services to learn more
about themselves and compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting changes with age, but some parts (how letters
connect, certain flourishes) are steadfast. Somewhere in their
early 20s, an individual sets a handwriting style, breaking away
from the rigors of penmanship lessons, notes Lynn. By this time, a
signature style is also developed.
</P>
<P>
   Does your signature differ significantly from your other
handwriting? Then you tend to have a public self and a private
self. And those of you with squiggles for a signature? Lynn says
either the writer signs things too many times in a day and doesn't
have time to make each one legible or cares little whether anyone
else can read the script.
</P>
<P>
   A forward slant of handwriting, for example, indicates a more
expressive, emotional person than one whose writing slants to the
left. Where a ``t'' is crossed indicates goal setting (High ``t''
cross, higher goals).
</P>
<P>
   WHAT IS A FORENSIC DOCUMENT EXAMINER?
</P>
<P>
   A certified professional who studies physical evidence,
including handwriting. Forensic document examiners do not determine
personality traits from handwriting; graphologists do. A
graphologist is to a forensic document examiner as astrologers are
to astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Stobaugh, supervisor of the forensic document section of
the DPS Crime Lab, often compares questionable handwriting to known
handwriting samples. A trained forensic examiner can eliminate
someone as the writer of a signature or determine, for example,
that a questioned suicide note was not written by the suicide
victim.
</P>
<P>
   These examiners employ ink analysis, paper scrutiny, envelope
matching, photocopier identification, wear characteristics, image
restoration, obliteration restoration, latent writing impressions
and even inspecting a document in identifying a writer.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S UP, DOC?
</P>
<P>
   Classes in penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Although the American Medical Association adopted guidelines in
1994 recommending physicians type or print prescriptions to avoid
error, many have failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce the annual 98,000 deaths caused by errors
include improving written communications. So doctors in hospitals
such as Cedars-Sinai Medical Center are flocking to classes that
begin with first-grade directions such as ``thou shalt not pinch''
the pen. Saving lives may be the result of these classes, but at
the very least, physicians will receive fewer late-night telephone
calls from pharmacists who cannot read their scrawls.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HANDLES 30,000 LETTERS AN HOUR?
</P>
<P>
   The United States Postal Service MLOCRs. That is the trade
moniker for Multiline Optical Character Readers. In Austin, there
are five of these electronic marvels as well as several Remote
Computer Readers. Automation equipment can process letters at a
cost of $5.20 per thousand. Manually sorted letters cost about
$57.64 per thousand to process. There's a saving!
</P>
<P>
   If these machines cannot decipher your hand, then the letter is
sent to a remote encoding center in Beaumont to be keyed by hand
(not the most direct route across Texas).
</P>
<P>
   These machines are more sophisticated than ever, notes USPS
spokeswoman Barbara Pokorny, but the letter carrier who slips the
mail into the box needs to be able to read your writing. And, no,
putting only the ZIP code plus will not guarantee delivery. The
traditional name and address is still needed. WOULDN'T YOU REALLY
RATHER HAVE A BUTTON GWINETT?
</P>
<P>
   Sure would, because this signer of the Declaration of
Independence died soon after the historic signing. His handwriting
fetches more than $100,000, an exorbitant amount compared with the
$2,000 that John Hancock's brings. Autographs and handwritten
manuscripts are popular and sometimes big-ticket collector items,
according to Sara Willen, senior appraiser of manuscripts at
California's Superior Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Men are more likely to collect handwritten documents than women.
They have the money and the ego, proclaims Willen. So what types of
items does Willen think will rise in value in the near future?
World War I letters and historic signatures as the 100-year
anniversary approaches.
</P>
<P>
   DOES GOOD PENMANSHIP PAY?
</P>
<P>
   It can.
</P>
<P>
   Just win the annual National Handwriting Contest sponsored by
Zaner-Bloser, publisher of handwriting texts. Winners (one for each
grade one through six) are awarded a U.S. Savings Bond, and the
grand champion prize is valued at more than $1,000. The 2000
national winner was Michigan fourth-grader Lauren Spaans, whose
cursive is impeccable. (Imagine the pressure on her mom when a note
to the teacher must be penned!) Schools wishing to participate in
the 2001 contest should call Zaner-Bloser at (800) 924-9233 or
visit www.zaner-bloser.com.
</P>
<P>
   WILL THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMP OVER THE LAZY DOG?
</P>
<P>
   He could during your next job interview.
</P>
<P>
   Handwriting analysis has been used in the interviewing process.
And it is legal to do so, concludes Chris Knepp, an attorney
board-certified in labor and employment law, ``as long as it does
not screen out people based on protected characteristics.'' An
employer who uses handwriting analysis to uniformly exclude a
certain group could be the subject of a lawsuit. Some jobs, of
course, demand legible handwriting _ teachers come to mind. In
these cases, a handwriting test could be every bit as important as
a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T BEAR TO WRITE THANK-YOU NOTES BY HAND?
</P>
<P>
   Go electronic and please the recipient at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up a copy of vLetter Pro for $149.95. Complete a
handwriting sample form, send it to the company, and within a
couple of weeks you are set (rush available). Install the program
on your computer. You type; it writes. In connective cursive yet!
The program also e-mails missives in your ``hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Signatures are included. Best customers? People doing holiday
mailings and writing thank-you notes, cartoonists and artists
wanting to save manual skills for work, as well as businesses
hoping to personalize correspondence. And, oh, yes, a man from
Texas, George W. Bush.
</P>

<P>
   TAKE TWO (OR IS THAT 200?) ASPIRINS AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING
</P>
<P>
   Simple advice _ if legible.
</P>
<P>
   Just this year, an Odessa jury awarded a widow $450,000 after it
decided that her husband's death was the result of poor penmanship
on the part of Dr. Ramachandra Kolluru and the poor interpretation
of his prescription by the pharmacist. Within 24 hours of taking
the wrong dose of the wrong medication, Ramon Vasquez suffered a
heart attack. He died two weeks later of congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   WRITE OR WRONG: THE COST OF POOR PENMANSHIP
</P>
<P>
   Poor handwriting costs American business and taxpayers $200
million annually _ through illegible purchase orders, phone
messages, meeting minutes, application forms and correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 percent of hospital medicine orders are returned by
pharmacists as illegible.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion to hand-held computers in Dade County, Fla., to
issue parking tickets collected an estimated $2 million in fines
annually previously lost because of poor penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   WRITE RIGHT: CONSUMER TIPS FROM DPS CRIME LAB
</P>
<P>
   Your signature should be legible to an uninterested party (i.e.
Not your wife or boss).
</P>
<P>
   Your signature should not be so simplistic that it can be easily
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   Destroy all credit card carbons.
</P>
<P>
   Shred personal documents or at least tear them into bits and mix
with wet, nasty garbage before disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Use a permanent marker when signing checks to foil check
washers.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful when mailing documents and bills. Use the post
office.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain pen signatures are more difficult to forge as they
impart shading in a signature.
</P>
<P>
   Practice good penmanship. A scrawl is easier to simulate than
clean handwriting.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   What type of menage does this trois make? A left-handed one.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 7-12 percent of the United States population
prefers the left hand to the right. Others among the southpaw ranks
include Babe Ruth, Robert Redford and Oprah Winfrey. More men tend
to be lefties than women; more young people than old. Unfortunately
it is a right-handed world. For more on the trends and tribulations
of left handedness, subscribe to ``Left Hander's Newsletter'' by

   INFOMERCIAL-CONVENTION _ ATLANTA _ They tried. Eager to come
across as ``Republican Party Animals,'' in author P.J. O'Rourke's

Federation star The Rock, a rollicking black gospel choir, ``NYPD
Blue's'' Rick Schroder, Comedy Central star Ben Stein playing ``Win
Ben Stein's Money'' with Miss America, and R&AMP;B crooner Brian
McKnight singing ``My body's callin' out your name'' while

   COTTON-GIN _ SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Amid the tangled, junglelike growth
along the lower Savannah River, a pile of crumbling bricks is all
that remains of the old plantation house where a young tutor
invented a machine that abruptly changed the course of the South _
and ultimately the entire nation. It was here, at Mulberry Grove
Plantation, eight miles upstream from downtown Savannah, that Eli
Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793. The simple machine, which
efficiently separated cotton fibers from seeds, ushered in the era
of King Cotton and, according to some historians, gave rise to
America's Industrial Revolution. (Seabrook, Atlanta

   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Every week I get two or three calls
from folks trying to save trees in their neighborhoods, even though
10 metro counties and several cities now have tree ordinances
requiring developers to submit tree plans for approval. Atlanta's
law requires ``no net loss of trees.'' That means when trees are
removed, they must be replaced by other trees that total the same
number of diameter inches. So if we've made progress with tree
protection ordinances, why the continuing outcry? It's simple:
People want to save old trees _ the native oaks, maples, hickories
and magnolias that set our city apart from others. But most tree
ordinances don't help with that. They allow ornamental trees to
replace the magnificent white oaks that have been around since the

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Those who thought this year's

does the deliveries voluntarily, even though it's not part of his

Atlanta. If Kinsey's approach to his job is unusual, so is ProCare.

upstairs to avoid drawing the ire of non-smokers. (Hendricks,

 &HT;    To preserve old trees, laws need to get a handle on the ax
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Every week I get two or three calls from folks trying
to save trees in their neighborhoods, even though 10 metro counties
and several cities now have tree ordinances requiring developers to
submit tree plans for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's law requires ``no net loss of trees.'' That means when
trees are removed, they must be replaced by other trees that total
the same number of diameter inches. A tree 12 inches in diameter,
for example, can be replaced by three trees that are four inches in
diameter.
</P>
<P>
   So if we've made progress with tree protection ordinances, why
the continuing outcry?
</P>
<P>
   It's simple: People want to save old trees _ the native oaks,
maples, hickories and magnolias that set our city apart from
others. But most tree ordinances don't help with that. They allow
ornamental trees to replace the magnificent white oaks that have
been around since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a Civil War-era oak is the reason DeKalb County enacted
the only ordinance in the region that's effective in protecting
existing trees. Three years ago, the county's second-oldest tree
was cut down in the night (as if nobody would notice) to make room
for a Wal-Mart parking lot. That spurred a group of DeKalb tree
lovers to push for a law _ as Kathryn Kolb, a leader of the group
put it _ ``against killing such a healthy, living piece of
history.'' Now, even private homeowners can't cut an old or
significant tree on their own property without permission from the
county arborist.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent calls from community activists in intown
neighborhoods illustrate why every local government should have a
similar law.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Coffin and her neighbors are trying to save some old
red oaks on property the state Department of Transportation just
sold across the street from the new Freedom Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park's John Lewis Plaza is supposed to be a statement
about history and green space, so why clear-cut across the street
from it?'' said Coffin, who has devoted the last decade of her life
to neighborhood trees. But the city caved in to a condo developer
who didn't want to save the oaks on the 4.4 acres _ even though the
city had an obligation to listen to neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 lawsuit settlement over a proposed freeway, Atlanta
neighborhoods entered into an agreement with the city and the state
DOT that gave residents a voice in how the DOT-owned property would
be used. The condo site is included in the property covered by the
settlement, so the neighbors _ who aren't fighting the condo
project, just trying to save a few trees _ went back to court.
Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Long hasn't ruled yet on their
injunction request.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Harvey, an artist who's lived in the city for 18 years,
has been fighting the DOT on a similar issue. DOT could have
preserved a forested dry creek which filters stormwater running
into Lullwater Creek when it sold lots in her neighborhood. But the
agency went for the money instead.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and her husband, Bruce, a high-profile defense attorney,
find special solace in the old trees around them. She derives
textures and colors for her paintings from leaves and bark. ``And I
love that Bruce always reaches out to touch the bark of certain
trees when we walk in the neighborhood,'' Paige said.
</P>
<P>
   Some good things are happening to save trees, although progress
is slow. Atlanta hired four new arborists this summer to handle
citizen demands. Starting next week, developers are required to
post maps of their tree plans on the property for 15 days and mark
the trees to be cut with bright paint. Citizens can appeal to the
tree commission if they think the tree ordinance isn't being
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   But only two things will save old trees: first, a commitment to
tree preservation from the top _ the mayor or the chairman of a
county commission. And second, a law like DeKalb's that won't let
developers be so shortsighted about our signature asset.

 &HT;    Birthplace of the Cotton Gin
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAVANNAH, Ga. _ Amid the tangled, junglelike growth along the
lower Savannah River, a pile of crumbling bricks is all that
remains of the old plantation house where a young tutor invented a
machine that abruptly changed the course of the South _ and
ultimately the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, at Mulberry Grove Plantation, eight miles upstream
from downtown Savannah, that Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in
1793. The simple machine, which efficiently separated cotton fibers
from seeds, ushered in the era of King Cotton and, according to
some historians, gave rise to America's Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the South's frenzy to feed textile mills up North and
overseas with cotton gave rise to a great expansion of slavery,
ultimately engulfing the nation in four years of bloody civil war.
Intensive cotton farming changed the South's landscape forever,
eroding the rich topsoil and leaving behind a red clay the color of
baked sweet potato.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the place that birthed this great upheaval is off-limits
to the public. Although 150 acres of Mulberry Grove are listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, the property sits behind
locked gates. Big black-and-white signs warn that trespassers will
be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings are posted by the property's owner, the Georgia
State Ports Authority, a quasi-governmental board of nine people
appointed by the governor to oversee the operations of the
state-owned docks at Savannah and Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The ports authority bought the property to expand operations at
Savannah's port, but that project has been on hold for 15 years
while the property has remained vacant. Historic preservationists
are appalled that a place so pivotal to Amercian history has
virtually been forgotten. Now, a major push is afoot to preserve
Mulberry Grove and perhaps eventually restore the old plantation
house.
</P>
<P>
   The ports authority has said it would consider giving up some or
all of Mulberry Grove, but it wants something in return: A swath of
land in the neighboring wildlife refuge to help with improvements
to the port. That's an unacceptable tradeoff, say wildlife
officials, who continue to negotiate. It is a delicate process,
trying to preserve an important piece of the past while also
accommodating the needs of Savannah's port, a powerful economic
engine for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Port officials say they must expand the facility to keep it
competitive. That's why, in 1985, the ports authority purchased
Mulberry Grove and other adjacent property _ about 2,200 acres
altogether _ for potential expansion of the port. A year later, the
authority announced that it intended to pave over hundreds of acres
of the property by the mid-1990s for new berthing space for
ocean-going ships. Ports authority officials now say the expansion
probably won't take place until later this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But another group _ the private, nonprofit Mulberry Grove
Foundation _ is determined that the expansion will never happen.
Instead, the group wants the former plantation to be preserved
forever as a historic park, telling the story of the cotton gin and
its massive impact on America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most historic places in the country, and it
amazes me that it has been so neglected,'' says foundation board
member Mark Yeager, a Decatur, Ga., architect.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Waters of Pooler, a retired Marine colonel who is the
foundation's chief executive officer, has accompanied several
visitors to Mulberry Grove over the years. ``They often tell me
they are awed to stand in the place where the event that changed
America occurred,'' Waters says.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's 12-member board also includes John Berendt, the
author of ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' and Augusta
resident Barry Whitney, fifth cousin of Eli Whitney four times
removed.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old group envisions a public place where visitors
stroll along trails with interpretive exhibits at key locations:
where slave cabins once stood, at the piles of brick that are the
only visible reminder of the plantation house where Whitney worked
on his invention and at the site where Whitney and his business
partner built the first ``ginning house'' in America.
</P>
<P>
   Waters says the foundation has shelved for now even more
ambitious plans for Mulberry Grove _ rebuilding the old plantation
house, recontructing a slave cabin or two and perhaps rebuilding
the old ginning house. The cost of that project is an estimated $5
million, a sum the foundation says is far out of reach right now.
</P>
<P>
   But implementing even the scaled-back preservation plans will
require getting the Mulberry Grove property from the ports
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is placing its hopes in the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, which manages the 27,000-acre Savannah National
Wildlife Refuge adjacent to the authority's docks at Savannah and
across the river from Mulberry Grove. The wildlife service is
authorized by Congress to expand the refuge by more than 14,000
acres if the land can be acquired from willing sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife service's expansion plans include the ports
authority's 2,200 acres that encompass Mulberry Grove. Wildlife
service officials say that if the agency acquires the property, it
would be willing to sign a long-term lease with the foundation to
establish the historic park. The agency also would support the
establishment of a museum on the property to help tell the story of
the cotton gin and the reign of King Cotton and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah refuge manager Sam Drake and ports authority officials
have discussed the federal agency's acquiring the property from the
authority, but so far no agreement is near.
</P>
<P>
   The ports authority has said it would be willing to consider
swapping all or most of its 2,200 acres in exchange for about 500
acres of the refuge directly across the river from the state docks,
where the authority wants to dump spoil from dredging the shipping
channel.
</P>
<P>
   But the wildlife service says the spoil would smother a huge
swath of the refuge's freshwater marshes, which teem with wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney, a Yale University graduate, didn't come to Savannah
with intentions of inventing a machine that would change the South.
He came to Georgia to tutor the children of a Savannah River
plantation owner near Mulberry Grove.
</P>
<P>
   When that job fell through, Mulberry Grove's mistress, Caty
Greene, who had become acquainted with Whitney, offered him a job
teaching her children. She was the widow of Revolutionary War hero
Gen. Nathanael Greene, whom George Washington placed in charge of
the Continental Army in the South.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Mulberry Grove, a rice plantation, was
confiscated by the government from its former owner because of his
loyalty to the British Crown during the war. The plantation,
including slaves, then was given to Gen. Greene by an appreciative
state of Georgia for his role in the Revolution. The general died
of a sunstroke in 1786.
</P>
<P>
   When Whitney arrived at the plantation some six years later, he
quickly impressed Caty Greene with his talent for fixing gadgets.
He perfected a frame for her embroidery and repaired her watch.
This delighted her, and she urged him to put his mind to inventing
the greatly needed cotton machine.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for a year on the project in an upstairs room of the
plantation house.
</P>
<P>
   Whitney became partners with Phineas Miller, Mulberry Grove's
overseer whom Caty later married. They formed the Miller and
Whitney Co. to market the cotton gin.
</P>
<P>
   The two business partners had to fight constantly to sustain
their patent, eventually becoming involved in 60 costly, drawn-out
lawsuits. Athough history credits Whitney as the inventor of the
cotton gin, neither he nor Miller derived any great financial
return from the machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Mulberry Grove Foundation's effort is only the latest of
several attempts to preserve the former plantation.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, for instance, the National Park Service
studied the possibility of making Mulberry Grove a national park
because of its historical importance.
</P>
<P>
   The plan never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable for current discussions on the property,
but Waters, the foundation's CEO, says this time there will be no
backing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of if we are going to preserve Mulberry
Grove, it's a question of when,'' he says. ``Mulberry Grove's place
in history is immense, and we can't give it up.''

 &HT;    CVS offshoot ProCare doesn't fit ordinary drugstore mold
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wil Kinsey delivers more than prescriptions to
patients infected with the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey, who is African-American, delivers prayers, praise and
positive messages. For that, Kinsey has earned the name, ``Black
Moses.'' He does the deliveries voluntarily, even though it's not
part of his job description as billing specialist at the ProCare
Pharmacy in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   If Kinsey's approach to his job is unusual, so is ProCare. It's
operated by CVS, the Woonsocket, R.I.-based conglomerate with 4,100
stores nationwide. But ProCare is not your typical chain drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   CVS started ProCare as a separate unit whose stores specialize
in high-priced drugs such as those needed by AIDS, hepatitis C,
cancer, multiple sclerosis, and bone marrow and organ transplant
patients. ProCare coordinates with Emory University Hospital to
stock prescription medicines needed by patients coming out of the
transplant unit.
</P>
<P>
   ProCare pharmacies carry drug quantities typically not stocked
by CVS stores. Sick people who need the drugs often must get them
through special order or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very different from the drugstore model,'' said Marie
Griffin, editor of Drug Store News, an industry publicatias a small
selection of supplies found in any drugstore. The local ProCare is
a gallery of sorts, with greeting cards and paintings by local
artists on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ProCare aims to serve consumers with chronic conditions in need
of complex and expensive drug therapies. Stores are staffed with
specialists who have in-depth knowledge of care programs and drug
interactions with other medicines and herbal remedies. They also
help figure out insurance coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``People spend a few thousand a month,'' Doxtater said.
``Transplant patients max out quickly. In a normal retail setting,
the pharmacists are not as concerned with that. We work with the
available benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   CVS expects strong growth and a healthy payoff from the ProCare
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This niche is growing faster than the overall pharmacy market
is,''said ProCare President Dennis Burton. ``The market is $14
billion nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The specialty pharmacy category, as it's called, accounts for
nearly 11 percent of prescription drug sales nationwide. Burton
predicts the market will blossom into a $20 billion market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you end up at ProCare, something's gone wrong with your
health,'' said Mark Miller, analyst with William Blair &AMP; Co. in
Chicago. ``They have pursued an integrated health care strategy
much more aggressively than their chief competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst David Magee, with Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta, said
both Walgreen's and Eckerd aren't as aggressive in this sector.
</P>
<P>
   Eckerd, for instance, is ``dealing with operation issues that
prevent them from having a real aggressive effort in the near
term,'' Magee said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ryan, chief executive officer of CVS, expects ProCare's
yearly revenue to be $2 billion to $3 billion in the next four
years from a total of 125 locations. That would equate to one-sixth
of CVS' 1999 sales of $18.1 billion. The company has 30 sites now
with plans for another 20 by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Some customers each) spend from $10,000 to $20,000 a year on
prescriptions,'' said Ryan during an earnings-related conference
call with analysts last week. ``ProCare sales are from $4 million
to $6 million a store.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, of Drug Store News, calls the sector the ``holy grail''
of the industry. Managed care companies are motivated to work with
ProCare because it saves them money to deal with one entity rather
than dozens of mail-order and independents, she said. Also, the
type of service at ProCare may encourage patients to stay on their
drug programs, reducing hospital costs.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta probably will get an ``additional two to three
ProCare locations,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   The company could gain another location through an acquisition.
ProCare plans to buy Stadtlanders, a mail-order pharmacy, for $124
million. When the transaction closes this fall, ProCare will gain
several mail-order distribution centers and a database of 50,000
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Stadtlanders has a metro Atlanta site, but it's unclear if that
location would be converted to a storefront.
</P>
<P>
   ProCare has expanded mostly by buying existing drugstores. An
example was its purchase last November of Atlanta Pharmacy, where
Doxtater was an owner. Doxtater stayed on as a pharmacist for
ProCare. Kinsey, the bookkeeper, continued to make volunteer
deliveries to patients who were unable to pick up their
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsey himself is infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a survivor,'' said Kinsey, who has had the virus for 15
years. ``But I get out, and I forget that I'm HIV positive. I just
bought a house.''

 &HT;    Networks shy away from `infomercial' conventions
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They tried.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to come across as ``Republican Party Animals,'' in author
P.J. O'Rourke's phrase, the just-completed GOP convention offered
World Wrestling Federation star The Rock, a rollicking black gospel
choir, ``NYPD Blue's'' Rick Schroder, Comedy Central star Ben Stein
playing ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' with Miss America, and R&AMP;B
crooner Brian McKnight singing ``My body's callin' out your name''
while MTV-style dancers practiced pelvic thrusts behind him.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually none of that made it onto TV, except for C-SPAN.
The broadcast networks had cut convention coverage to its lowest
amount since they started in the convention business in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is just following the audience. The parties need to make
things more interesting, less boring,'' Linda Schrenko, Georgia
state superintendent of schools, said last week on the floor of the
GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday night saw a surge of viewers watching George
W. Bush's acceptance speech, overall Nielsen ratings for the
convention were down last week, as expected. One example: On
Tuesday night, 10 million viewers watched ``Dateline NBC's'' report
on the ``Jerry Springer murder case.'' When NBC switched to Sen.
John McCain's convention speech at 10:30 p.m., more than half the
audience clicked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings are not great, and it's hardly surprising, because
we have been telling people for days and days and days this is
boring, it's pre-scripted, it is pre-packaged, it is pre-chewed,''
said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's media roundtable ``Reliable
Sources.''
</P>
<P>
   `A PERVERSE PROCESS'
</P>
<P>
   The political parties, largely acting out of a desire not to
look foolish on TV, have turned their conventions into carefully
choreographed spectacles, as rehearsed and scripted as any sitcom.
ABC, CBS and NBC, in turn, complain there is no news, and abandon
coverage. (CNN folks sometimes complain about the lack of news,
too, but know that the conventions are a place the all-news network
plants its flag, no matter what.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican Convention now finished for 2000 and the
Democrats still to come Aug. 14-17, the whole notion of a mass
American audience watching political conventions seems as quaint as
June Cleaver doing housework in hose and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perverse process,'' said Jeffrey Scheuer, author of
``The Sound Bite Society.'' ``It's an amplified version of what
happens all the time between politics and television, where each is
trying to manage the other side to conform to its imperatives and
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-news conventions are due in part to the primary system,
which chooses a candidate earlier and earlier; the last convention
at which there was even a whisper of a doubt was the GOP in 1976,
when Ronald Reagan was challenging Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   COURSE ALTERATIONS RARE
</P>
<P>
   Still there have been times in recent memory when a convention
turned into its own rough, unruly animal, such as the media
freeding frenzy when George Bush picked Dan Quayle as his running
mate in 1988, or the GOP in 1992, when Pat Buchanan gave his
infamous _ and lengthy _ ``culture wars'' speech and pushed former
President Ronald Reagan out of prime time. There were heated
platform debates over issues such as abortion, and political
posturing, such as Democratic efforts to accommodate Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   That's all in the past tense now, as carefully screened
``regular people,'' as ethnically diverse as a UNICEF stamp, speak
perfectly on message and stay on time like Mussolini's trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are party infomercials, attempting to sell a
candidate,'' said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. One of the
main Republican sales tools was steering away from congressional
Republicans, whom the Bush campaign felt would clash with the idea
of ``a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always some grumbling about lack of news in the sense
of conflict, sparks. We love that stuff,'' says Brit Hume, the
former ABC correspondent who's now chief anchor for cable's Fox
News Channel. ``But the networks are being disingenuous about why
they're not covering the conventions. There are powerful economic
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: When NBC blew off Gen. Colin Powell's speech
Monday night for a rerun of ``Third Watch,'' it attracted more than
10 million viewers. When NBC ran Dick Cheney's acceptance speech
Wednesday night, only 5 million watched.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN BUCKS TREND
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to change the steps in the reluctant dance
between conventions and convention coverage? There are two
competing ideas: toward more entertainment, or toward more news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually these conventions will evolve into something more
appropriate to television, which is basically glitzy variety shows,
like 'The Kennedy Center Honors' with a political twist: novelty
acts, comedy,'' said political analyst Jeffrey Scheuer. ``They've
already ceased to have any political function.''
</P>
<P>
   You could see some of this trend this past week. If you were
watching C-SPAN, that is. CNN and PBS, still dauntless in the
extent and seriousness of their coverage, pretty much ignored the
entertainment interludes the GOP provided, such as Stein and
Schroder, to connect with an audience that views the world through
a totally televisual context.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be even more of the same when the Democrats gather
in Los Angeles. A ``celebrity delegation'' including Ben Affleck,
Ted Danson and Patricia Arquette will attend the convention, and an
off-site fund-raiser Aug. 17 is scheduled to include Barbra
Streisand, Enrique Iglesias and Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   SEEK TO PROMOTE CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   At a roundtable in Philadelphia sponsored by Harvard
University's Vanishing Voters Project, Edward G. Rendell, chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, had a different remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The networks should commit to four hours of coverage a night, he
suggested, but insist that one hour each night be devoted to a
specific controversial topic, with both sides represented. The
result, he hoped, would have conflict, drama and enlightenment.
Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, part of PBS' coverage team,
suggested more or less the same idea last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, raise the level,'' Rendell said. ``You're the
networks. You can do this.'' Of course, CNN and PBS already offer
such point-counterpoint debates within their coverage, although
never for a full hour on one issue.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News president Andrew Heyward, without endorsing Rendell's
proposal, agreed that ``conflict is educational and I think it
should be encouraged, not for entertainment value, but because it
does help illuminate things.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are party voices who favor letting the conventions
return to a messier format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpredictability is good,'' said Chuck Clay, chairman of the
Georgia Republican Party. ``We should be less afraid of letting
people say what we don't know they're about to say. It shows the
diversity of our party and lends an air of excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   But any reform of the dysfunctional dance between the broadcast
networks and the parties must fight the reality that both sides
have extremely strong (and, possibly, mutually exclusive) reasons
for leading us to the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks have a serious economic problem,'' said Fox's
Hume. ``(The cable news channels) just need to get the news
junkies. If (ABC, CBS and NBC) only get the news junkies, they lose
money terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And the political parties ``don't care how many people watch,''
said CNN's Howard Kurtz. ``They care about the images that linger,
that people carry in their heads, the headlines in the paper. They
want to make a nice impression. They are not necessarily in the
ratings game.''

look foolish on TV, have turned their conventions into carefully
choreographed spectacles, as rehearsed and scripted as any sitcom.
ABC, CBS and NBC, in turn, complain there is no news, and abandon
coverage. (CNN folks sometimes complain about the lack of news,
too, but know that the conventions are a place the all-news network
plants its flag, no matter what.)
</P>
<P>
   With the Republican Convention now finished for 2000 and the
Democrats still to come Aug. 14-17, the whole notion of a mass
American audience watching political conventions seems as quaint as
June Cleaver doing housework in hose and high heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perverse process,'' said Jeffrey Scheuer, author of
``The Sound Bite Society.'' ``It's an amplified version of what
happens all the time between politics and television, where each is
trying to manage the other side to conform to its imperatives and
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-news conventions are due in part to the primary system,
which chooses a candidate earlier and earlier; the last convention
at which there was even a whisper of a doubt was the GOP in 1976,
when Ronald Reagan was challenging Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   COURSE ALTERATIONS RARE
</P>
<P>
   Still there have been times in recent memory when a convention
turned into its own rough, unruly animal, such as the media
freeding frenzy when George Bush picked Dan Quayle as his running
mate in 1988, or the GOP in 1992, when Pat Buchanan gave his
infamous _ and lengthy _ ``culture wars'' speech and pushed former
President Ronald Reagan out of prime time. There were heated
platform debates over issues such as abortion, and political
posturing, such as Democratic efforts to accommodate Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   That's all in the past tense now, as carefully screened
``regular people,'' as ethnically diverse as a UNICEF stamp, speak
perfectly on message and stay on time like Mussolini's trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are party infomercials, attempting to sell a
candidate,'' said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider. One of the
main Republican sales tools was steering away from congressional
Republicans, whom the Bush campaign felt would clash with the idea
of ``a new beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always some grumbling about lack of news in the sense
of conflict, sparks. We love that stuff,'' says Brit Hume, the
former ABC correspondent who's now chief anchor for cable's Fox
News Channel. ``But the networks are being disingenuous about why
they're not covering the conventions. There are powerful economic
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: When NBC blew off Gen. Colin Powell's speech
Monday night for a rerun of ``Third Watch,'' it attracted more than
10 million viewers. When NBC ran Dick Cheney's acceptance speech
Wednesday night, only 5 million watched.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN BUCKS TREND
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to change the steps in the reluctant dance
between conventions and convention coverage? There are two
competing ideas: toward more entertainment, or toward more news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually these conventions will evolve into something more
appropriate to television, which is basically glitzy variety shows,
like 'The Kennedy Center Honors' with a political twist: novelty
acts, comedy,'' said political analyst Jeffrey Scheuer. ``They've
already ceased to have any political function.''
</P>
<P>
   You could see some of this trend this past week. If you were
watching C-SPAN, that is. CNN and PBS, still dauntless in the
extent and seriousness of their coverage, pretty much ignored the
entertainment interludes the GOP provided, such as Stein and
Schroder, to connect with an audience that views the world through
a totally televisual context.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be even more of the same when the Democrats gather
in Los Angeles. A ``celebrity delegation'' including Ben Affleck,
Ted Danson and Patricia Arquette will attend the convention, and an
off-site fund-raiser Aug. 17 is scheduled to include Barbra
Streisand, Enrique Iglesias and Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   SEEK TO PROMOTE CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   At a roundtable in Philadelphia sponsored by Harvard
University's Vanishing Voters Project, Edward G. Rendell, chairman
of the Democratic National Committee, had a different remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The networks should commit to four hours of coverage a night, he
suggested, but insist that one hour each night be devoted to a
specific controversial topic, with both sides represented. The
result, he hoped, would have conflict, drama and enlightenment.
Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, part of PBS' coverage team,
suggested more or less the same idea last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, raise the level,'' Rendell said. ``You're the
networks. You can do this.'' Of course, CNN and PBS already offer
such point-counterpoint debates within their coverage, although
never for a full hour on one issue.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News president Andrew Heyward, without endorsing Rendell's
proposal, agreed that ``conflict is educational and I think it
should be encouraged, not for entertainment value, but because it
does help illuminate things.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are party voices who favor letting the conventions
return to a messier format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpredictability is good,'' said Chuck Clay, chairman of the
Georgia Republican Party. ``We should be less afraid of letting
people say what we don't know they're about to say. It shows the
diversity of our party and lends an air of excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   But any reform of the dysfunctional dance between the broadcast
networks and the parties must fight the reality that both sides
have extremely strong (and, possibly, mutually exclusive) reasons
for leading us to the current situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks have a serious economic problem,'' said Fox's
Hume. ``(The cable news channels) just need to get the news
junkies. If (ABC, CBS and NBC) only get the news junkies, they lose
money terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And the political parties ``don't care how many people watch,''
said CNN's Howard Kurtz. ``They care about the images that linger,
that people carry in their heads, the headlines in the paper. They
want to make a nice impression. They are not necessarily in the
ratings game.''

 &HT;    Networks shy away from `infomercial' conventions
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They tried.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to come across as ``Republican Party Animals,'' in author
P.J. O'Rourke's phrase, the just-completed GOP convention offered
World Wrestling Federation star The Rock, a rollicking black gospel
choir, ``NYPD Blue's'' Rick Schroder, Comedy Central star Ben Stein
playing ``Win Ben Stein's Money'' with Miss America, and R&AMP;B
crooner Brian McKnight singing ``My body's callin' out your name''
while MTV-style dancers practiced pelvic thrusts behind him.
</P>
<P>
   But virtually none of that made it onto TV, except for C-SPAN.
The broadcast networks had cut convention coverage to its lowest
amount since they started in the convention business in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV is just following the audience. The parties need to make
things more interesting, less boring,'' Linda Schrenko, Georgia
state superintendent of schools, said last week on the floor of the
GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thursday night saw a surge of viewers watching George
W. Bush's acceptance speech, overall Nielsen ratings for the
convention were down last week, as expected. One example: On
Tuesday night, 10 million viewers watched ``Dateline NBC's'' report
on the ``Jerry Springer murder case.'' When NBC switched to Sen.
John McCain's convention speech at 10:30 p.m., more than half the
audience clicked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ratings are not great, and it's hardly surprising, because
we have been telling people for days and days and days this is
boring, it's pre-scripted, it is pre-packaged, it is pre-chewed,''
said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's media roundtable ``Reliable
Sources.''
</P>

 &HT;    Miracle matches in two organ-donor dramas
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ To have and to hold, in sickness and in health,
Mike and Carol Bracken consummated their marriage in the most
unheard-of way.
</P>
<P>
   If you think that Adam's rib stuff is farfetched, consider: Mike
now has Carol's kidney keeping him alive.
</P>
<P>
   So much for what sour-on-marriage sorts call the old
ball-and-chain. Mike finding Carol, and Carol finding out she was a
tissue match, freed him from a lifetime of misery and dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   One miracle down, countless more to do.
</P>
<P>
   Make that two down. You decide which is more miraculous.
</P>
<P>
   The other one happened between complete strangers, but not by
chance. Tom Warnock was frustrated when he couldn't donate a kidney
to help his buddy, Army Sgt. John Pierce. Tom's wife Valarie,
though she didn't know Pierce, offered a hand. She ended up giving
a kidney.
</P>
<P>
   Generally the rule is that the only person from whom one might
hope to get a kidney is from a corpse or a blood relative. Here are
two exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Miracles like these are becoming less miraculous thanks to
people like Carol and Valarie, and because of medical advances.
Mainly, it helps significantly when the donor is alive and in an
adjacent room.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving from a live donor means almost no inert time for the
kidney compared to an organ that will be on ice for hours.
Seventy-two hours is just about the limit.
</P>
<P>
   So in these two cases, the offerings of Carol and Valarie were
not only customer matches, they were the best merchandise on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   For the Brackens, the transplant June 7 was the end of a
roller-coaster ride. Mike, 57, who runs Waco's Central City Car
Care Center, had been on dialysis for two years. He married Carol,
a widow, last December.
</P>
<P>
   When the ordeal on an organ waiting list became hers by
marriage, she broached the subject of getting her blood tested to
see if she could donate to him. He said no.
</P>
<P>
   She went ahead and did it without telling him.
</P>
<P>
   The unbelievable news that they matched was met with more
resistance from the worried husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I can't accept it,'' he told her. ``I didn't marry you to
hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she convinced him that his welfare was her own.
</P>
<P>
   So, euphoric at the prospects, the couple traveled to San
Antonio in May only to be told that a last-second test of her
antibodies suddenly put the operation on ice. ``You're not a match
any longer,'' they heard.
</P>
<P>
   They returned home crushed. Three days later, with results from
one more test, doctors said, ``It's a go.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery went great. The kidney, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't any time until that sucker was active,'' said Mike,
who knew his bride's gift was giving when he saw his catheter bag
sitting empty.
</P>
<P>
   As for Valarie Warnock and Sgt. Pierce, they knew of each other
indirectly and may have met before briefly, but their first real
meeting was to strike up a relationship of prospective donor and
recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, a 34-year-old paratrooper, was injured in a tree landing
while making a jump in combat maneuvers in Panama in 1990.
Subsequent health problems, including a bout of double pneumonia,
caused kidney failure. In 1995 he went on dialysis and onto the
kidney waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   He and Tom Warnock, who works with outpatients at the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center, are good friends. Warnock got tested to see
if he could donate a kidney, but didn't match. When wife Valarie
heard of the situation she knew she was called to help this man, or
someone like him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if my kidney isn't for John Pierce it's for somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   The kidney was for Pierce. The surgery was done June 16 in
Nashville at a VA hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``A total act of love'' is how Pierce describes it.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Valarie shed a kidney, she had to give up 25
pounds, a precaution against late-onset diabetes. Oh, yes. She's a
mother of six. In sum, it was some sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awesome opportunity'' is what she calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Both donors remarked that the procedure, using small
laparoscopic incisions, was amazingly less intrusive than feared.
And both women were on their feet almost immediately, with little
lasting discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Both donors now are ardent advocates of people getting a blood
test for a donor match.
</P>
<P>
   They know of all the kidney patients spending several hours
every week hooked to a machine, waiting for a donor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the dialysis patients it just really broke my
heart,'' said Valarie, who doesn't think herself nearly as heroic
as the man who got her kidney, or the people hooked to those
machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go,'' she said. ``Go get tested.''

 &HT;    Smokers light up when they find a bar
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hartsfield is bucking the anti-smoking trend sweeping
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles banned smoking in bars in 1998 and, nationwide,
tobacco companies are settling lawsuits brought by the states for
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But a bar caters to smokers on Concourse A. The Budweiser
Brewhouse has been a successful draw since it opened July 10,
according to managers.
</P>
<P>
   A floor above the gates, the Brewhouse avoids contact with
nonsmokers in the general foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised it was here,'' smoker Ellen Fiorenza said.
``It's actually a pleasant atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiorenza and her husband, Lou Fiorenza, came to Hartsfield to
meet some business acquaintances last week and discovered the
Brewhouse as they came up the escalators from the underground train
station.
</P>
<P>
   They saw the signs to the smoking bar and took a chance that
they could get a cup of coffee instead of a brew at 10 a.m. They
did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much nicer than that confined (public) smoking lounge
down the concourse,'' said Lou Fiorenza, who is not a smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield has public smoking lounges on Concourses A, B, C and
E. Two other bars allow smoking: Images Bar &AMP; Grill on E and
Sojourners Lounge, which is the only smoking refuge on Concourse D.
There's not enough room on D for a public smoking lounge, airport
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield had been considering adding a smoking bar for several
years and finally asked joint venture operator Concessions/Paschals
International to create the bar. The bar just leases Budweiser's
name, but the brewery also provided the interior design, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was customer demand and, yes, it's a cash cow,'' said
Denise Kevil of Concessions/Paschals. ``All the smoking lounges
were full all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Open only several weeks, the 56-table bar operates at 45 percent
capacity, said Schree Potts-Ramsey, who manages the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Potts-Ramsey, who managed a restaurant and lounge in Atlanta,
said she had to get used to the ``push'' times at the airport.
Pushes occur several times a day as airline schedules hit peak
periods, then ebb before another push comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10 minutes with customers,'' Potts-Ramsey said. ``So
customer service starts as soon as they come through the door. They
can get a sandwich, a cold drink and smoke, and all the time
someone is looking after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeat business should also be a strong point. ``We've noticed
people for the second time in just the few weeks we've been open,''
Potts-Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another source for repeat business. Managers have
noticed that they would serve a customer and then an hour or so
later they would be back because of flight delays.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY
 &HT;    Compassionate rhetoric contradicts GOP record
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The George W. Bush of Bob Jones University seemed light years
away from the Bush who brought an upbeat GOP convention to its
climax last week. The Texas governor delivered a well-scripted
speech with conviction and optimism. Except for his pledge of
support for the social agenda of the right and the promise of a
fairy-tale tax cut, Bush stuck to a mainstream agenda of saving
Medicare and Social Security and improving education.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it lasts or not, Bush should be commended for setting a
positive tone and avoiding the harsh partisan attacks of recent GOP
conventions. Philadelphia was not a Republican convention, though _
it was a Bush convention.
</P>
<P>
   And it is that difference that portends the greatest problems
for Bush in the coming months. He will be pressed to explain how
his moderate optimism jibes with the negativism and extremism the
GOP Congress has exhibited on issues like the environment and
health care. He must speak to his differences with the party
platform. He must explain the conflicts between his rhetoric and
his record in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently repeated line at the convention was that no
child will be left behind. Though Bush extolled Head Start, his
vice presidential choice, Dick Cheney, voted against the federal
early education program when he was in Congress. And Bush's pledge
to improve education for poor children is contradicted by a party
platform that rips into the federal program that gives schools
extra money for disadvantaged students.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, some children in Texas have been left behind. The
state's child poverty rate stands at 24.2 percent, compared with
20.4 percent nationally. While Bush says all American families and
their children must have access to health care, his administration
opposed matching state dollars for the federal Children's Health
Insurance Program and funds to get more poor families enrolled in
Medicaid health insurance. Today, 600,000 of the state's poorest
children are without guaranteed health care.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received wild applause, especially from the Teenage
Republicans, when he mentioned protecting American's natural
resources. But his spokesmen promised Western state delegates in
Philadelphia that Bush would work to reverse the Clinton
administration's support for saving 43 million acres of dwindling
roadless areas in the national forests. Bush has already promised
to support GOP leaders in Congress who want to open up the National
Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, emphasized the importance of providing
a safe, nurturing environment for children. But there was no
mention of keeping children and communities safe from guns. Even
the pleas of parents haven't budged Bush from his loyalty to the
National Rifle Association. He signed into law a bill to protect
Texas gun manufacturers from lawsuits by cities and one that allows
people to carry concealed handguns into public places, such as
movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities and women were given leading speaking roles at the
GOP convention, which conveyed an encouraging big-tent message, at
least on stage. But the delegates, the vast majority of them white,
mostly suburban and affluent, will have to reach outside their
traditional communities if the party is to evolve into a more
diverse one.
</P>
<P>
   Only as Bush addresses some of these inconsistencies will the
American people know whether Philly was anchored in the Republican
candidate's true principles or just part of his paid packaging.

 &HT;    All about Eva
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back when Atlanta-born romance novelist Eva Rutland
used a typewriter, she'd sometimes discover that it had run out of
paper. It wasn't that her concentration was so rapt _ or that her
story was so steamy.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Rutland is blind.
</P>
<P>
   She may not be a household name like Barbara Cartland. But this
83-year-old Spelman College graduate and granddaughter of a former
slave is one of the most prolific romantic authors working today.
On Saturday, she came home to pick up a Gold Pen Lifetime
Achievement Award at the African American Online Writers Guild's
first Black Writers Reunion &AMP; Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rutland, who writes with a voice synthesizer on her computer but
isn't on the Internet, has penned 23 books, including more than a
dozen Harlequin Romances and this year's semi-autobiographical
mainstream novel, ``No Crystal Stair'' (Mira, $5.99). That book _
about a strong-willed woman who grows up in the cloistered world of
Atlanta's black aristocracy, only to watch the old order swept away
by the Civil Rights movement _ is a kind of 20th century black
woman's ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to the organization that gave the award, Rutland's
greatest contribution was to integrate the publishing world at a
time when black women writers were virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about being a writer until after my children
were born,'' says the Sacramento, Calif., grandmother of six.
``Then I began to be concerned about racial prejudice, and I
thought if black mothers and white mothers could talk together,
just like we are talking now, then they would understand that we
all have the same problems. So I began to write articles and send
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   To her surprise _ this was the '50s and '60s _ Redbook, Woman's
Day and Ladies' Home Journal published them. Her only non-fiction
book, ``The Trouble With Being a Mama: A Negro Mother on the
Anxieties and Joys of Bringing Up a Family,'' appeared in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, she began writing ``sweet romances.'' At last
count, her books have been distributed in 29 countries. Ironically,
most of her characters are white. She once considered making a
central character black, but a friend told her not to tamper with
success.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the author of ``Her Own Prince Charming'' and ``No
Accounting for Love'' has just traveled 3,000 miles across the
country in an airplane. But she politely sits for a two-hour
interview in the cafe of the Ramada Inn where she's staying.
Nibbling chicken fingers and fries and sipping a glass of white
Zinfandel, Rutland says her daughter Patty-Jo, who traveled with
her, is unhappy with the plain navy shirt dress her mom has chosen.
A former debutante who was once considered one of Atlanta's most
beautiful women, Rutland looks a good 20 years younger than she is.
</P>
<P>
   Talking with this octogenarian is like reading a chapter on
Atlanta's pre-Civil Rights era. Her first story was published by
the Atlanta Daily World when she was about 12. Four years after
Emancipation, her maternal grandfather, Isaac Westmoreland, built
the house in which she was born near what is now Turner Field. ``We
had a very big yard, so everybody played in our yard _ black,
white, Jewish and Gentile.''
</P>
<P>
   The family was one of the few to have its own pew at First
Congregational Church, where a massive stained glass in her
grandfather's memory remains. At Booker T. Washington High School,
Rutland appeared in theatrical productions with actress Lena Horne
_ and she used to hobnob with Josephine Dobbs, daughter of civic
leader John Wesley Dobbs.
</P>
<P>
   And yet as happy as her childhood was, segregation left its
mark.
</P>
<P>
   While in her '20s, a white surgeon working in a private black
clinic damaged her vocal chords while removing her thyroid gland.
``I didn't realize that he was as trapped by segregation as I was.
It may have been because he didn't have the facilities and he
didn't have his regular staff. But he cut my vocal chords and they
were so close together that I wasn't getting much air.'' When she
returned for treatment, she says, he kicked her out of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when she speaks, she must push her gold ``E'' initial
pendant aside to put a finger over the hole in her throat _ a
tracheotomy tube. She believes her blindness, which occurred 30
years ago and was caused by macular deterioration, may be a result
of medication she took for her thyroid condition. Her voice is
raspy, her eyes glassy, and she laughs in little hiccups. Yet she
is a picture of courage, perseverance and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   She has never let her own troubles darken her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the boy meets girl (formula),`` she says. ``They have a
few problems and live happily every after. I love those simple
stories. That's because I like to laugh. I don't want to read about
the tragedies and what they did to us a long time ago and how
deprived we are. I like upbeat stories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think women would be so much happier, the world would be a
much better place, if men read more romances,'' the author says.
Her favorite novel is Jane Austen's ``Pride and Prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many novelists, she says, ``I don't do the explicit sex.
Some writers do it very very well. If you want to know how to make
love, read some of those romances. I find them boring because the
sex interrupts the story, and they are so repetitive. How many ways
can you make love? They've done them all, so I've read them all.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a momentary pause, a tiny wheeze. ``If I had read those
things when I was younger, I'd have been a much better wife.''

doing there. 1,600 words. By Carlotta Gall.

   ISRAEL-DONKEY-WAR (Qalqilya, West Bank) _ There were no
casualties in the ``Donkey War'', as one of the Israelis ruefully
called it when the dispute with the Palestinians was over. No
casualties, that is, apart from two mangey donkeys, which ended up
being pulled away from an Israeli animal rescue specialist to be
slaughtered for animal food at Qalqilya's Palestinian-controlled
zoo. The jurisdictional dispute in this mainly Palestinian town
about 20 miles northeast of Tel Aviv told its own story about the
anger that can still flare between Jews and Arabs, Israelis and
Palestinians, as their leaders attempt to negotiate a comprehensive
peace deal to end decades of estrangement and war. Resentments
accumulated over a century and more can invest the least of
disputes, even when the issue involves one of God's humblest
creatures. By John F. Burns.

result: an increase in nontraditional print ads that fold out, up
or down; come with Post-It Notes or perforations; and require
special devices like 3-D glasses or bar code scanners. By Stuart
Elliott.

ADVERTISING: SELLING BY STUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reverse-bound pullout and a standalone sound like stunts that
gymnasts will attempt next month as they compete for medals at the
Summer Games. Well, those stunts are planned for September, but
look for them from magazine publishers in America rather than
Olympic athletes in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Each September, many magazines publish what are their largest
issues, fattened by advertisements for new car models and clothes
as well as promotions pegged to the coming school year and football
season. The more ad pages that appear, the more advertisers strive
to be heard above the din. The result: an increase in
nontraditional print ads that fold out, up or down; come with
Post-It Notes or perforations; and require special devices like 3-D
glasses or bar code scanners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clutter begets clutter,'' said Charlie Rutman, executive vice
president and managing director at Carat USA in New York, a media
agency owned by the Aegis Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people who want to win the game, there are two ways to
do it,'' Rutman asserted. ``Either spend more, and create even more
clutter, or try and be innovative, unusual, impactful, which gets
you beyond the clutter.''
</P>
<P>
   Two large magazines based in New York _ In Style, part of the
Time Inc. unit of Time Warner, and Glamour, part of the Conde Nast
Publications unit of Advance Publications _ are taking new steps to
help advertisers catch the attention of readers.
</P>
<P>
   In Style will include in its September issue, due out on Aug.
25, a mini-magazine dubbed a reverse-bound pullout because it will
be bound inside the back cover and can be detached to be read
separately. The pullout will be composed of 18 editorial pages and
18 ad pages; the September issue is to run 704 pages, including
about 435 ad pages.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones New York clothing line will solely sponsor the
pullout, titled the In Style Going Out Guide.
</P>
<P>
   And Glamour will publish on Aug. 15 its first standalone issue,
which will be sponsored by three advertisers: Revlon, the Sara Lee
Corp. and the Zale Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-page special issue, expanding a popular monthly Glamour
feature known as ``Dos and Don'ts,'' will be sold separately from
the regular September issue, at a cover price of $3.50.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for the pullout was ``word from our readers, and
advertisers, that people are tearing pages of the magazine out and
shopping from them,'' said Louis Cona, publisher of In Style.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on an airplane in the spring flying back from
Milan, I saw a pullout in Wallpaper,'' he added, referring to a
youthful home and lifestyle magazine published in Britain by the
Time Life Entertainment Group unit of Time Warner, which devoted
its reverse-bound mini-magazine to remodeling bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Cona said he believed that such a supplement ``had never been
done in the U.S. before, but there is a big demand for being
unique, for standing out.''
</P>
<P>
   At Revlon, Cheryl Vitali, executive vice president for Revlon
global marketing in New York, said: ``We evaluate many, many
opportunities and pass on a lot of them. We were intrigued by this
one because it's a smart idea and we hope we'll get to benefit from
that. We like the content; it has value, versus something that's a
throwaway.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Glamour and In Style placed their projects under
the supervision of the editorial departments rather than the
advertising departments. That means the contents are composed of
articles, not so-called ``advertorial'' copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been big on advertorials; we've probably done just
two or three,'' Cona said, adding: ``I think they confuse the
reader. Advertisers should take advantage of the power of the
editorial.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the motivation for Jones New York to participate, said
Benny Lin, senior vice president and creative director at the
parent, the Jones Apparel Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones is ``always open to new ideas to set us apart and
raise our brand awareness, we're very selective,'' Lin said. ``The
magazines we partner with need to have good integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   After Cona told Rutman at Carat USA about the supplement, Rutman
recommended it to Lin, who approved it. The sponsorship cost an
estimated $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The three advertisers for the Glamour ``Dos and Don'ts'' issue
are paying a sum estimated at just more than $1 million for their
sponsorships. Besides their ad pages, they will also sponsor a
consumer sweepstakes, a fund-raiser for Goodwill Industries and a
clothing drive, ``Donate Your Don'ts,'' at offices of ad agencies,
Conde Nast, Revlon and Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast will print 600,000 copies of the special Glamour,
compared with a circulation of 2.1 million for a regular September
issue. In Style is printing about 2.3 million copies of its
September issue into which the pullout will be reverse-bound. Jones
New York will distribute additional copies of the pullout to
retailers to give to shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In Style is already planning a second reverse-bound pullout,
Cona said, to appear in the fall; a retailer will be the likely
sponsor, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Fine, publisher of Glamour, said she anticipated
bringing out two standalone ``Dos and Don'ts'' issues in 2001,
increasing that to four a year ``eventually.''

WITH NEW BOSS, GORE CAMPAIGN STILL TRAILS _ BUT FEELS BETTER ABOUT
IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Ill., Texas, Calif.)   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Six weeks after taking charge of Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, William M. Daley has not
yet figured out where everybody works in the sprawling and frenetic
Gore headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, where's Mark's office?'' he sheepishly asked a young aide
one night last week, scrunching his bushy eyebrows as he wandered
right past the door to the lair of Mark Fabiani, the deputy
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in his short time here, the former commerce secretary
seems to have significantly revived the once flagging morale of the
Democratic campaign, both in Nashville and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After a spring when the campaign was accused of squandering any
momentum created by Gore's victories in the Democratic primaries,
Daley has moved to curtail the infighting that had sapped the
campaign's energy and to impose badly needed discipline on its
strategy and message.
</P>
<P>
   He has freed Gore to focus on essential decisions rather than on
the power struggles back home, and he has reassured Democratic
partisans that the campaign is back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Top Gore supporters, including congressional leaders and
officials with major constituent groups, say that they have noticed
a distinct change since Daley replaced the ailing Tony Coelho, and
that they have been soothed by Daley's straightforward presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came and spoke to our caucus last week and the turnaround
in attitude that he brought was very noticeable,'' said Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader. ``He exuded a confidence
about the organization that my colleagues needed and wanted to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president, had initially complained
that he was not consulted about Gore's appointment of Daley, who
earned the enmity of labor by leading the administration's lobbying
for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the normalization
of trade relations with China. But after Daley spent two days this
week meeting with labor leaders in Chicago, Sweeney had nothing but
kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things are moving in the right direction,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``I think that since Al Gore named Bill
Daley to head up his campaign, Daley has been working extremely
hard on a number of fronts. And certainly I can say he's been
meeting with us regularly and making sure that working-family
issues are at the center of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest change in the campaign's leadership, its second in
barely a year, could have been deeply destabilizing. But as Gore
moves into two critical weeks in which he will select a running
mate and accept his party's nomination in Los Angeles, his aides
and leading supporters say they feel more optimism than at any
point since the vice president vanquished Bill Bradley and swept
the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale is shockingly high here for a campaign that's 10 points
behind,'' one top Gore aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, by almost any standard, had a lousy spring.
After the primaries, the campaign drifted for weeks with little
sign of a general-election strategy. Gore allowed Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas to cruise unchallenged back to the center after he
was forced to the right in the Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also manufactured its own crisis when the vice
president broke with the White House to maintain that Elian
Gonzalez should be given permanent residence status, a move seen as
such a craven appeal for Cuban-American votes that it reinforced
Bush's contention that the vice president would say anything for
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign experimented constantly with its message and its
tone, first attacking Bush stridently, then backing away. That,
too, only seemed to buttress the Republican criticism of Gore,
whose various public transformations inspired Bush to declare in
his acceptance speech at the Republican convention that he was
``not running in borrowed clothes.'' By late spring, Gore had
unwittingly made himself an underdog, consistently trailing in the
polls despite his association with the prosperity of the Clinton
era.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, a 51-year-old Chicago native, was not looking for work
when Gore woke him from a deep slumber at 12:15 a.m. on June 15 to
tell him that Coelho, who had led the campaign for a year, was
resigning for health reasons. He said he felt he had the best job
in government and was content to ride out the last six months of
the Clinton administration in his spacious office in Washington,
and on the golf course on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who had spoken to Daley about leading the campaign a
year before, was insistent that he needed his considerable
political skills. ``I was out of it, I mean dead sound asleep,''
Daley said of the phone call. ``I said, `Well, why don't we get
together tomorrow and have a cup of coffee?' And he said, `Why
don't you get up and make a cup of coffee?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes later the deal was sealed, and Daley
immediately began to shed his duties at Commerce. He started full
time on July 17, commuting between Washington and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who is known for his straight talk, acknowledged in an
interview last week that the Gore campaign was troubled at the
time. ``It's not a secret that there was a period there of internal
debate on the thrust of the campaign,'' he said, ``a concern that
we had lost some ground from the primaries, that Bush was running a
good noncampaign campaign, that his base came home quicker and that
we were still working on our base.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In addition, the direction of the campaign had become a struggle
among distinct power bases: the paid staff, led by Coelho and Donna
Brazile, the campaign manager, who themselves had occasional
disputes; Washington consultants like Carter Eskew, Tad Devine,
Robert Shrum, Bill Knapp and the pollster Harrison Hickman, some of
whom have moved to Nashville; Gore family members, including Gore's
wife, Tipper, his daughter Karenna Gore Schiff and his
brother-in-law, Frank Hunger; staff members in the office of the
vice president in Washington; and old Gore hands like Peter Knight,
Roy Neel, Tom Downey and Jack Quinn, all of whom are now Washington
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who resigned after suffering epileptic seizures and
intestinal problems, receives decidedly mixed reviews from Gore's
aides. He is deeply respected, almost revered, for having guided
Gore successfully through his primary fight with Bradley and for
obsessively pursuing goals like winning the endorsement of the
AFL-CIO. He and Brazile made difficult but needed cuts in staff and
budget and oversaw last fall's move of the campaign from Washington
to Nashville (the headquarters are now in an office park
conveniently situated on Mainstream Drive).
</P>
<P>
   But despite his long tenure as a congressman from California,
Coelho was never able to become the public face of the campaign,
largely because his role as leader of the U.S. exhibit at a 1998
world exposition in Portugal was the subject of a State Department
investigation into suspicions of financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   And by insisting on tight control of all aspects of the
campaign, including access to the candidate, he bred resentment and
alienation among many advisers with long relationships with Gore.
For instance, Quinn, a former Gore chief of staff, said he and
other former aides had felt ``underutilized'' during Coelho's
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The internal tensions were papered over while Gore aides made
common cause of defeating Bradley. But they re-emerged after the
primaries and all too often the candidate himself was called upon
to mediate, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of squirreling around here about the
battles, the personality disputes, and I think that sucked him into
it a lot,'' Daley said. ``I think he was having a lot of people
call him, you know, nyah, nyah, and you hear this about this one,
this about that one, this one's not doing this, nothing's being
done, yadda, yadda, yadda. And they were all going around each
other to him, and that's not the way it should be. The candidate
cannot be made to be put in that position, and I think he was being
put in that position by just about everybody here.''
</P>
<P>
   That has changed, Daley asserts. ``He's performing much better
because I think he's not burdened by worrying about the campaign as
much,'' he said. ``He's doing his thing. He's not the campaign
manager. He's not the chief issues person. He's the candidate, and
I think he's made that transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley's arrival coincided with the unveiling of the campaign's
latest message, a double-barreled populist appeal that casts Gore
as the candidate most likely to continue the country's prosperity
and Bush as the captive of powerful interests. Daley has insisted
that the campaign stick with those themes for the last month and
has encouraged the kind of dexterity that led Gore to rip up his
schedule one day in July and go to Texas to blame Bush for that
state's fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be we couldn't stay on message for a week,'' one
senior Gore aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani, the campaign's communications director, said Daley had
brought ``an overall direction to the campaign so we can stay on
course no matter what happens, rather than being buffeted by events
and things beyond our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, a top strategist, said Daley had ``brought some stability
and confidence, and those are important in showing the external
world that there's a mission and a plan, and in giving the
candidate confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime Democratic operative, as well as the son of
Chicago's former mayor and the brother of its current one, Daley
has the advantages of vast connections in party politics and an
intimate knowledge of the Midwestern states that are expected to be
this fall's battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   He has presented the campaign's case in regular television
appearances, has become a key adviser on convention planning and
the vice-presidential selection; he is overseeing the expansion of
the campaign's paid staff from 75 people to 300.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought Ronald A. Klain, a former Gore chief of staff,
and Monica Dixon, a former deputy chief of staff, to Nashville to
invigorate the campaign's rapid response operation (known as ``the
kitchen''), a mainstay of the 1992 and 1996 Clinton campaigns. And
he has renewed contact with Gore allies who felt shut out,
prompting Quinn to observe that ``he's the sort of guy who leaves
no resource unused.''
</P>
<P>
   In a close election, such things can matter, several Gore aides
said. ``These campaigns are all about the candidates,'' Quinn said,
``but campaign leadership really does keep people rowing not only
in the right direction but rowing together.''

E-MAIL SPARKS GROWING INTEREST IN NEW INVENTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic mail has become ubiquitous, so it comes as no
surprise that independent inventors, as well as advertisers,
consumer electronic and telecommunications companies, are working
on new ways to exploit this form of communication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anyone who has ever lost a cell phone, personal digital
organizer or a laptop knows how it feels to mislay a device that
may contain critical personal or professional information. The
feeling is even worse if the device is stolen. Now a Japanese
inventor has capitalized on wireless technology to patent a method
of sending an e-mail to a lost or stolen device that will lock the
appliance or erase the data it holds.
</P>
<P>
   Mikio Hasebe, of Gyoda, Japan, has developed a system in which
the owner of a wireless-enabled device such as a laptop chooses a
password and a security response in case anything should happen to
the computer. If the laptop is stolen or mislaid, the owner can
write the password in the subject line of an e-mail and send it to
the device. Assuming the computer is operating, or when it is
turned on, software in the laptop would then initiate a
pre-determined security response, either locking the display screen
so nothing would appear, showing only the name and contact
information of the owner, or erasing the laptop's hard drive. Mikio
Hasebe won patent 5,987,609 for Kabushiki Kaisha Toshiba, in
Kawasaki, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Some people write e-mails online, while others write messages
and then log on to send them. Advertisers want to reach both types
of Internet users, and now a New York inventor has won a patent for
Juno Online Services LP that would ensure that banner
advertisements and other kinds of online ads would run even when a
message writer was not online.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Moraes, of Forest Hills, N.Y., created a system in which
advertising is downloaded through an e-mail server when a
subscriber is online. Later, when the subscriber uses his computer
to write e-mails, the commercials that are stored on his system
flash across his screen. Moraes recommends in his patent that the
ads be targeted to the individual and changed frequently. When the
subscriber logs on to send e-mail and retrieve new messages, the
e-mail server would update the advertisements according to a
pre-determined distribution schedule. The next time the user writes
an e-mail, the ads that have already appeared on his screen will
have been replaced with new ones. Moraes won patent 6,014,502.
</P>
<P>
   Many people receive e-mails with breathless subject lines like
``Available now, millions of CDs!'' ``Make money from home,'' or
``Get Viagra online!'' Most avoid opening such unsolicited
promotional e-mail, lest they find their names added to even more
junk e-mail lists. But two Japanese inventors, Akira Kamakura and
Hideki Tanaka, have patented a method of encouraging people to read
and to reply to their junk mail. Their idea is to award bonus
points for each answered message. Each piece of junk e-mail would
contain an offer of bonus points, and when the recipient replied to
the pitch, a database system would transfer points to their name.
The bonus points accumulate, and eventually the junk e-mail
recipient can redeem them for gifts. The invention belongs to
Fujitsu Limited, in Kawasaki, Japan, and the inventors received
patent 6,076,101.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people would probably say that the best e-mail
enhancement they could imagine would be a way to eliminate junk
e-mail altogether. A new patent awarded to a San Francisco
inventor, Sunil Paul, aims to do that by screening out unsolicited
mass promotions. An e-mail address that serves as a probe is
planted along a communications network so that it gets picked up
and included in mass junk electronic mailings _ the sizeable ones
known as spam. The probe's e-mail boxes are monitored in a control
center to look for incoming spam.
</P>
<P>
   When unsolicited e-mail is found, the system analyzes its origin
and creates a signal that informs Internet servers of the spam
source. The alert is then forwarded to network servers and user
terminals, where filters store the information and then use it to
vet e-mail from the spam source. Junk e-mails can either be
rejected, delivered but flagged as ``JUNK,'' or processed under
special instructions from the addressee. Paul received patent
6,052,709.
</P>
<P>
   Attachments often accompany e-mail, and many times people find
themselves trying to read a document that is not formatted with
compatible software. Converting attachments is often
time-consuming, and sometimes impossible if the recipient doesn't
have the right programs. Three inventors for Siemens Information
and Communications Networks Inc., in Boca Raton, Fla, have won a
patent for a system that translates the file format of attachments
before sending them to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   To use the system, a customer would register the format
capabilities of his or her computer with a local or remote Internet
service provider. When an e-mail with an attachment is directed
through the service provider to the customer, the system first
compares the attachment's format to the capabilities of the
computer to which it is destined. If it sees that the computer
can't perform the conversion, it will do it instead. The inventors,
Shmuel Shaffer, William Beyda and Paul Bonomo, received patent
6,092,114.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail devotees like to know whether they have new messages even
when they are not online. Dan Kikinis, of Saratoga, Calif., won a
patent for DataLink Systems, Corp. in San Diego for a paging system
embedded in a computer keyboard. When an e-mail is received but the
recipient is not online, the server matches the e-mail address to a
dial-up paging service. A page is sent to a telephone number that
results in an alert such as a flashing light on the keyboard, or
instructions to the computer to automatically log on and download
the e-mail. Kikinis received patent 6,085,232.
</P>
<P>
   At the AT&AMP;T Corp. in New York, five inventors have combined
voice and e-mail in a patented system that allows subscribers to
get both just by looking in their e-mail box. The system converts
voice mail into e-mail. The system then converts the voice message
into text or a .wav file, formats either one as an e-mail and sends
it to the recipient. Sanjay Agraharam, Lee Begeja, Carroll
Creswell, Ram Ramamurthy and Sandeep Sibal received patent
6,085,231.

SANTA FE OPERA'S `ERMIONE' IS A VOCAL FEAST (Photos available from
http://www.santafeopera.org/PressPhotos/PressPhotos.htm.) &HT;    By CHARLES WARD
 &HT;    c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The first Santa Fe Opera production of
Gioacchino Rossini's ``Ermione'' may surprise opera fans who know
only his comedies, ``The Barber of Seville'' and ``Cenerentola''
(Cinderella).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ermione'' is a tragedy with a story by the ancient Greek
Euripides via 17th-century French playwright Jean Racine. It offers
a dazzling score _ with three important tenor roles, no less. The
music is unmistakably Rossinian in rhythm and energy, yet
consistently imaginative and engaging.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the score provoked some equally dazzling
performances led by Bulgarian soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska as
the title character.
</P>
<P>
   Premiered in Naples in 1819, ``Ermione'' was particularly dear
to Rossini. When Neopolitan audiences responded coolly, he withdrew
it. ``Ermione'' wasn't heard again until 1987, when the Rossini
Opera Festival in Pesaro, Italy, revived it with the great
Monterserrat Caballe in the title role.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is Epirus, an ally of Greece, after the 10-year
Trojan War. Pirro (the Italian form of Pyrrhus) holds Andromaca,
widow of the Trojan hero Hector, and her young son Astianatte.
</P>
<P>
   Though engaged to the Greek princess Ermione, Pirro loves
Andromaca. She resists, in honor of her dead husband. He uses every
machination to change her mind _ including threatening to kill
Astianatte (a mute role).
</P>
<P>
   The Greeks would love that, for they are terrified that Hector's
son could grow up to lead a new war. So they send Oreste to Epirus
to demand the boy's execution. Defiantly, Pirro declares he will
marry Andromaca and make Astianatte his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Fatally for Pirro, Oreste loves Ermione. Enraged by Pirro's
passion for Andromaca, Ermione cons Oreste into killing Pirro at
the wedding. When Oreste returns to claim her hand, she sends him
packing, blaming her behavior on her mad love for Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   End of opera.
</P>
<P>
   That final betrayal is typical of ``Ermione.'' In today's terms,
the characters are like politicians with the emotions of American
high-schoolers. When they aren't turning on their allies, they're
either madly in love or about to die _ usually because of cruel
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Immature as these emotions might seem today, they inspired
Rossini to write arias for each of the four protagonists, four
duets and several large ensembles. His music expresses emotions
from deep pathos to grand hyperbole, always couched in challenging
virtuosity, including coloratura fireworks spanning two octaves.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the musical peak occurred in a duet early in Act 2.
Pirro celebrates Andromaca's decision to marry while she vows to
commit suicide as soon as she has secured the safety of her son.
Tenor Gregory Kunde and mezzo-soprano Sara Mingardo were on fire
musically. Their emotions were intense, and the unity of their duet
singing was outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But neither matched Pendatchanska, who got the canary-fanciers
(vocal fans) talking. Ermione's manic changes of mood were fuel for
this scene-eating dramatic soprano. She raged and ranted
emotionally. Vocally, she ran through the runs and leaps with a
celebratory display. The part was a dream for a singer with a
distinctive stage persona and a fascinating voice of dark, cutting
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Kunde, Barry Banks (Oreste) and Charles Castronovo (as Pilade,
the aide of Oreste) were as good a trio of tenors as could be
assembled today. Currently, the opera world has very few fine
Rossini tenors _ light, agile voices that can throw off high notes
effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Banks was the most daring, even and intense of the three. Kunde
was less consistent in his upper range; otherwise he had a
commanding, almost arrogant presence. Castronovo was sturdy in a
modest part, principally a duet with baritone Michael Krueger (as
Fenicio, an advisor of Pirro's).
</P>
<P>
   Mingardo, an Italian making her American debut, sang with the
dusky intensity of a superior contralto. At times her stage manner
was too impassive; indeed, she was almost implacable when Pirro
announced he would kill her son if she didn't give in to his
marriage proposal. But her fine singing and strong technique
overshadowed that weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The production was split-minded.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella Bywater's set was effective: a simple V-shaped unit
with a break where the two walls met.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jonathan Miller decided to have Bywater dress the cast
in 19th-century uniforms that were vaguely American and Italian.
The choice made no sense; fortunately, it was not a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Italian conductor Evelino Pido led tidily.
</P>
<P>
   In a delight for keen listeners, Pido burnished the range of
colors in Rossini's orchestration, which are far more vivid than
in, say, ``The Barber of Seville.'' But he and the orchestra always
supplied the rhythmic energy that is the defining element of
Rossini's operatic style.

NEW ECONOMY: TELECOM DEAL ILLUSTRATES UNWRITTEN TENET OF U.S. TRADE
POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that the way America threw around its military
might was what perturbed our allies. Now, it seems, it's the way we
do business that rankles.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example surfaced late last month when Washington got
into tiffs with two of the United States' most important trading
partners, and very nearly a third, over what could be called the
corn syrup corollary.
</P>
<P>
   This unwritten tenet of United States economic policy goes
basically as follows: ``Do as I say, not as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   The corollary refers specifically to the 1993 negotiations that
led to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Worried that sugar
produced in Mexico's ancient refineries would flood the United
States, an inventive Congress decided to count corn syrup as sugar
in determining the level of Mexican sugar exports that would
trigger tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   This verbal alchemy came at a time when President Clinton was
badgering Mexico to drop its own trade barriers. Mexico's economy
is one-twentieth the size of America's, and Mexicans resented what
they saw as pure protectionist posturing. But they felt they had no
choice but to enter Nafta. The U.S. sugar lobby was happy, even
though as recently as this month it has continued to lobby against
Mexican exports.
</P>
<P>
   The corn-syrup-for-sugar swap set a pattern that has dismayed
allies and trading partners alike. Consider the European Union,
which has been in high dudgeon since late July when the U.S. Senate
threatened to block Deutsche Telekom's $50.7 billion acquisition of
a rookie American cellular telephone company, the VoiceStream
Wireless Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate is concerned about Deutsche Telekom's family
tree. The German government still owns about 58 percent of the
giant telecommunications company, which was totally state
controlled until 1996. Several key senators worry that any company
even partially owned by a foreign government would have unfair
competitive advantages when it comes to raising capital. They also
have concerns about national security.
</P>
<P>
   But the VoiceStream deal would reduce the German government's
stake in Deutsche Telekom to 45 percent, and the company says that
the government stake will continue to dwindle through subsequent
acquisitions or through government sell-off of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Germans suspect the United States is trying
to shield its domestic telecommunications industry. They are backed
by their cohort in the European Union, who say that restrictions
against Deutsche Telekom violate commitments the United States made
to the World Trade Organization a few years ago to keep its
telecommunications market open to all. The European Union has
threatened to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan Roett, a corporate consultant and director of the
Western Hemisphere program at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the reason
for the contradictions in U.S. economic policy was ``as simple as
catering to special interests,'' with little regard to the effect
such zigzags have on the nation's trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In their night of nights, in the dark of their dark, they
probably understand what they're doing in Washington,'' Roett said.
``On a case-by-case basis, they rationalize this strategy by saying
they are defending U.S. interests from the dark forces that come
from outside. They say they don't see the contradictions in that
position, but they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   To clear things up, those Beltway insiders probably should take
a second look at what happened at the end of the same week sabers
were rattled against Deutsche Telekom. A few days later, Charlene
Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative, and Clinton's enforcer
on international commerce, took the first steps toward hauling
Mexico before the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The charge? Well, looky here: Failing to live up to commitments
Mexico made to the WTO to keep its telecommunications sector open
to competition. The same charge, in other words, that the Europeans
are making against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it seems clear that Barshefsky is carrying water
for big American telecommunications companies that are fighting for
market share in Mexico, while key members of Congress are trying to
ward off Deutsche Telekom in the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and WorldCom accuse Mexican regulators of being soft on
Telefonos de Mexico, which, like Deutsche Telekom, is a former
state-owned monopoly. They say that as Mexico's telecommunications
sector has been deregulated _ partly because of Nafta _ Telefonos
de Mexico continues to dominate the market.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said there was no doubt Telmex was thwarting
competition by greatly overcharging for connections to the local
grid and refusing to provide the high-speed lines that competing
companies need to offer Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is intolerable,'' she said rather testily during
a conference call with reporters to announce the action against
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico now must explain itself before the WTO, and if the
problems cannot be resolved, Barshefsky will file a formal
complaint against Mexico, which is the United States'
second-largest trading partner after Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico insists it has met all its commitments to the WTO. Jorge
Nicolin, director of the Federal Telecommunications Commission of
Mexico, said Barshefsky was protecting the interests of American
companies, not the principles of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   In the same week, the United States offended the Europeans and
angered the Mexicans, the corn syrup corollary was invoked by yet
another U.S. ally. At a hearing before the subcommittee on the
Western Hemisphere of the House Committee on International
Relations, Brazil's ambassador reminded U.S. officials that
globalization and free trade were not a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reciprocity is the name of the game,'' said Rubens Antonio
Barbosa, the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Washington's avowal that free trade is the foundation of
prosperity and peace, Barbosa told the panel, an arsenal of trade
barriers impedes the entrance of 80 major Brazilian products _
including sugar, shoes, steel and frozen orange juice _ into the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The list of American barriers he rattled off is formidable:
``Tariff peaks, retaliatory threats, anti-dumping and
countervailing measures, quotas, safeguards, voluntary restriction
agreements, restrictive technical norms, sanitary and phytosanitary
measures and increasing domestic subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador wondered out loud how the United States could
defend such a battery of trade restrictions while pushing for the
creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, if anyone were willing to give it, would sound a lot
like the corn syrup corollary.

`Elektra' an electrifying close for Sante Fe's Crosby &HT;    Editor's note: The first ``a'' in Klytemnastra takes an umlaut.
(Photos available from

 &HT;    By CHARLES WARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Fittingly, the founder of Santa Fe Opera is
ending his 44 years as its general director with the best
production of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   With Mary Jane Johnson in the synapse-crossed title role,
Richard Strauss' ``Elektra'' was a riveting story of rotting
personalities at Friday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   In establishing Santa Fe Opera as the country's premiere summer
opera festival, director John Crosby made the operas of Strauss one
of its signatures. Many of the composer's lesser-known works are
staged elsewhere today because of Crosby's advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, his typically understated conducting, which can let
music drift, was perfect for ``Elektra,'' whose musical
characterization of sick people can overwhelm the listener. The
orchestra propelled the drama and painted personalities deftly
rather than bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   Like two other works in Santa Fe's repertoire this season _ Hans
Werner Henze's ``Venus and Adonis'' and Rossini's ``Ermione'' _ the
story of ``Elektra'' comes from ancient Greek history and
mythology.
</P>
<P>
   Elektra was the daughter of Agamemnon (whose brother, Menelaus,
married Helen). While Agamemnon was away fighting the 10-year
Trojan War, his wife, Klytemnastra, took up with Aegisth.
</P>
<P>
   When Agamemnon returned home after the war, Klytemnastra
murdered him. Their children _ Elektra, Chrysothemis and Orest _
pledged to kill their mother in revenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the opera, with libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal after
Sophocles, Elektra's obsession has turned her half mad. She swears
she will dance triumphantly over the bodies of her father's
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysothemis is a coward. When Elektra tries to enlist her aid,
she shies away, saying she only wants to live in peace as a wife
and mother. Elektra is left to plot the revenge by herself and dig
up the ax she has hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Klytemnastra is so wracked with guilt she either can't sleep or
is consumed by terrifying dreams. She makes endless animal
sacrifices to the gods without relief. She is initially pleased
when Elektra offers advice about the right sacrifice _ but becomes
terrified when the daughter roars out that it should be
Klytemnastra herself.
</P>
<P>
   Word that Orest is dead changes Klytemnastra's mood to joy _ but
that is a ruse. He has snuck into the palace and, after revealing
himself to Elektra, goes off to get revenge.
</P>
<P>
   As Klytemnastra's screams echo from the palace, Elektra is
exultant but, in her frenzy, she dances herself to death,
collapsing lifeless as the opera ends.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Texas Panhandle, Johnson brought a steely-toned
magnetism to Elektra: on the edge of madness, yet cunning and
consumed. She sang powerfully over the large orchestra as it
vacillated _ like Strauss' artistic temperament _ between the rage
of dissonance and the calm of tonality.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Judith Forst, as Klytemnastra, provided the searing visual
symbol of the production staged by John Copley. She was a
semi-invalid needing hand-held crutches with wrist braces to
balance herself. This pitiful physical condition matched her
tenuous mental state _ and Elektra was quick to take advantage of
both.
</P>
<P>
   In the single most chilling moment of the opera, as the two
women fenced verbally, Elektra finally snatched both of the
crutches away, causing Klytemnastra to topple.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when the mother heard the purported news of Orest's death,
she thought she had triumphed once more and someone found the will
to walk.
</P>
<P>
   Forst's portrayal was mesmerizing vocally and physically.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Susan B. Anthony had childlike longing for normalcy as
Chrysothemis. Bass-baritone Greer Gimsley, an early member of
Houston Opera Studio, brought rich-voiced, single-minded intensity
to Orest.
</P>
<P>
   Tenor Ragnar Ulfung was the besotted Aegisth, who makes a brief
appearance at the end before going off to his death as well.
</P>
<P>
   The new production, designed by Bruno Schwengl, was utilitarian
and stark.
</P>
<P>
   A huge angled wall to the audience's was dominated by
double-doors reached by stairs parallel to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of a former large statue of a man littered the stage.
Presumably the subject was Agamemnon, the way Elektra kept running
to the reclining head.
</P>
<P>
   Copley's direction was sensible for an opera with a lot of
singing and not much action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elektra'' plays again Wednesday and Aug. 17 and 24.

<P>
   Stephen Riggio remembers telling executives at Barnes &AMP; Noble
that the Internet was the future of bookselling in 1994, before
Amazon.com had even begun. But he has never gotten much credit for
it. By the time he founded Barnesandnoble.com, in 1997, Barnes &AMP;
Noble had become watchwords for letting an Internet upstart eat
your lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Last week should have been heartening. Amazon.com lost its
president, missed its revenue projections and saw its stock plummet
amid doubt of its ability to branch into new markets. One Lehman
Brothers analyst even questioned how long the company would be able
to pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Barnesandnoble.com (www.bn.com) suffered, too. The company
reported a wider-than-expected loss and missed its own revenue
target by more than 14 percent, a sign to some analysts of a
growing saturation of demand for books from people already online.
Investors sent its stock tumbling more than 25 percent to close on
Friday at $3.75 a share, down from a 52-week high last fall of
$23.50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   This week should come as a welcome relief from all the bad news
for Riggio, brother of Barnes &AMP; Noble's founder Leonard Riggio and
acting chief executive of its online spinoff. He will enjoy a novel
role reversal. Now it is his turn to play the new media visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com is teaming up with Microsoft on Tuesday to
open the first major online store selling digital books, available
for downloading and reading on a screen or in single paperback
copies printed on demand on high-speed presses _ a technological
capacity that Amazon.com does not yet have.
</P>
<P>
   The launch is a pivotal event for the company and a bellwether
for the industry. Although many consider the idea of reading on a
screen awkward and far-fetched, some publishers hope that
electronic books will provide a new avenue of growth in an
otherwise nearly flat business, just as first paperbacks and then
audio books did in the past. As the first major outlet for digital
books, the new store will assay the depth of consumer demand, the
prices readers are willing to pay and the danger of piracy and
hacking. For Barnesandnoble.com, analysts say, selling digital
books could some day hold out the potential for new, more
profitable sales within the company's traditional franchise _
books.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for that reason, Riggio has been pushing the e-book idea
for years, according to current and former employees. One of
Riggio's first directives when he resumed Barnesandnoble.com's
day-to-day management in January, long before the idea took off
with publishers, was to install a tab for electronic books on its
home page.
</P>
<P>
   The digital-book store is a big bet for a small company,
considering that no one yet knows the size of the potential demand.
To build its presence in the digital book market,
Barnesandnoble.com invested $20 million in MightyWords, which
publishes short digital books. The company spent undisclosed
millions more on technology for downloading electronic books,
providing storage space and processing payments.
</P>
<P>
   For its part on Tuesday, Microsoft will introduce the latest
version of its free software for reading on screens. The new
edition is easier to use than its predecessors and is available for
desktops and laptops as well as expensive hand-held devices.
Microsoft executives say that no skeleton-key code-breaker will be
able to open all of the electronic books available for its
software, but no single electronic book is fully hacker-proof.
</P>
<P>
   The dual launch offers Barnesandnoble.com a chance to benefit
from Microsoft's formidable marketing strength. Microsoft is
backing the new venture with a sizable campaign, and in the process
promoting Barnesandnoble.com. In an unusual boon to authors and
publishers accustomed to begging for attention, Microsoft is
actually paying some of them for the right to advertise their books
with its software. Microsoft, in turn, hopes to make its money in
the form of a small commission on each sale of a digital book for
its software.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com and Microsoft did not disclose the terms of
their agreement. Microsoft expects to work with other Web sites,
and Barnesandnoble.com will continue selling books in other
electronic formats.
</P>
<P>
   The site will begin with more than 2,000 digital titles
available in the Microsoft format, adding about 150 new titles a
week. In addition to selling electronic books, Barnesandnoble.com
hopes to use them to keep its customers coming back, another area
where the company has lagged behind Amazon.com. The company will
offer virtual shelf space to customers, by investing in computer
servers that will store shoppers' digital books online. Customers
can download the same title to the same one or two computers as
often as they like, easing the need to store the electronic texts
on their hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   The digital-book store also sets the stage for a new battle with
publishers. Riggio said the company planned to expand its
long-standing publishing program into digital books. ``Publishers
really add very little value to the distribution of book content,''
he said. ``They are not terribly good at physical book
distribution, and they are not very good at technology. They will
have a place in the digital world, but smaller than it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, which holds a large stake in the online unit,
previously published its own editions of books in the public
domain, like ``Leaves of Grass'' or ``Middlemarch.'' But now
Barnesandnoble.com has hired a respected former illustrated book
publisher, Michael Fragnito, who has begun meeting with agents to
discuss buying the digital rights to previously published works
still under copyright.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Barnesandnoble.com into direct competition with
traditional publishers, its major suppliers, who are themselves now
scrambling to acquire the digital rights to their authors' back
lists. As Chris MacAskill, MightyWords' chief executive, discovered
when he published some authors' short essays, traditional
publishers can be quite territorial. ``Publishers get very, very
jumpy about digital rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggio says the digital rights originally belong to the
author, not the publisher. ``We strongly believe that the author is
entitled to a very big share of the savings that results from the
distribution of digital content,'' he said. What royalty rate
Barnesandnoble.com will offer for digital rights to previously
published titles remains to be set, Riggio said.
</P>
<P>
   He maintains that, in time, Barnesandnoble.com will flourish in
the online world because most of its products _ books, videos and
music _ can be delivered over the Internet. To promote its
products, he says, the site is already becoming an online
broadcaster. Barnesandnoble.com began a network for 16 online radio
stations, soon expanding to 120, along with online video
programming about authors and books, BNTV.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, some analysts say Barnesandnoble.com's most
promising innovation may be more low-technology delivery
techniques, particularly its same-day delivery program. In
Manhattan, any order before 11 a.m. is delivered by 7 p.m., at no
extra charge, by a fleet of Barnesandnoble.com trucks and
messengers. Riggio says the company is evaluating similar services
in other cities. Barnesandnoble.com also lets people return online
purchases at Barnes &AMP; Noble stores. (Until recently, it was even
possible to receive a refund greater than the online price.)
</P>
<P>
   But, although most analysts support Barnesandnoble.com's
investment in electronic books on the chance of a payoff years down
the road, few expect it to help the company's sagging stock price
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the low share price, rumors have spread through the
industry that Bertelsmann was seeking to buy the online bookstore
outright. Flush with cash from selling a stake in America Online,
Bertelsmann has been buying up struggling Internet retailers to
build an Internet commerce empire under its own brand. Bertelsmann
executives have pointedly declined to comment on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio, too, declined to comment on any talks, except to say
that ``we talk to them about all kinds of things.'' Both Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Bertelsmann are ``committed to the business,'' he said.
The online store expects to begin making a profit in 2002, and
analysts say its profits could help Barnes &AMP; Noble bolster its own
sagging shares. In the meantime, Riggio says, Barnesandnoble.com
has over $350 million in cash and no debt _ plenty of capital to
stay in business till the company turns a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Riggio has a long way to go to restore Wall Street's
faith in the company. For one thing, some say that, after more than
doubling from one year to the next, the days of explosive growth in
online bookselling are over. People already online seem to be
buying as many books online as ever they will, said Mark Rowen,
Internet analyst at Prudential Securities. As a result, he says,
growth in the online book market is slowing significantly, to about
the rate that new consumers hook up to the Internet or a little
faster _ about 20 percent to 25 percent a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Barnesandnoble.com
faced an uphill battle because it was locked into marketing
agreements with other companies like AOL, limiting its ability to
cut costs when revenue declines. Worse, he said, Barnesandnoble.com
thus far has failed to take advantage of Barnes &AMP; Noble's 544
retail stores to win new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect their customer acquisition costs to be lower than
pure Internet companies, and, the bottom line is, they still are
higher than Amazon's,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, Noto said, is motivational. The online
store threatens to steal sales from the retail stores, and, except
for the Riggios, Barnes &AMP; Noble executives have no incentive to
work together. Others blame a lack of stable management. Riggio
assumed the title of acting chief executive seven months ago, and
the company still has no replacement.
</P>
<P>
   But Riggio said that the analysts were ``very wrong.'' ``I don't
know the analyst who has been inside the company or met with its
management,'' he said, calling his management team ``one of the
most stable in the sector.'' Cooperation between the chain and the
online store, he insisted, was coming along fine. He declined to
name specifics but promised ``exciting things in the next six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted the company's marketing costs would decline, too.
Heavy spending to advertise in print, radio and television is
``behind us now,'' he said, and the company could use its access to
Barnes &AMP; Noble stores to strike advantageous marketing deals, like
its agreement with America Online. ````We'll be around in 10 years,
or 20 years. People are more motivated to work with us now than
with companies in the Wild West shootout that had been the
Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for hiring a new chief executive, Riggio said, his day-to-day
management ensured continuity and the board would make a decision
in due time. ``I am among the candidates being considered,'' he
said.

REOPENING OF ORTHODOX SEMINARY HINGES ON TURKISH-GREEK RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEYBELI ISLAND, Turkey _ The marble floors are polished to a
high gloss. The latest scholarly journals are arranged with care in
the famous library. The sparse dormitories are spotless and, in one
huge hallway, two pingpong tables stand ready, nets taut.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is in perfect order at the Holy Theological School of
Chalki, one of the most historic and important seminaries in
Orthodox Christianity. But the only students are the ghosts of
monks and priests who lived and trained here for over 1,000 years
before the Turkish government closed the school in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pleadings of Orthodox leaders and the urgings of
Turkey's allies, most recently President Clinton, Turkish
authorities insist that the school remain closed under a law that
gave the government control over higher education in religious and
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The primary motive for the law was to impose government
authority over training Islamic clerics, but it also snared the
theological seminary run by the Greek Orthodox Church on the
picturesque Heybeli Island, in the Sea of Marmara.
</P>
<P>
   The name means ``saddle bag island'' in Turkish, and it derives
from the two hilltops that embrace the lower harbors, though the
Greeks called it Chalki. The island is part of a small archipelago
known as the Prince's Islands about an hour's ferry ride from
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth century, the monasteries and convents on the
islands became infamous as a place of exile for ousted Byzantine
rulers, with emperors and empresses alike finding themselves
banished to cells there. In the latter part of the 19th century,
the start of steamboat service allowed wealthy Istanbul residents
to build summer villas in the islands. Leon Trotsky lived in a
mansion on the largest island from 1929 to 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The islands retain a quaint charm, despite the profusion of
villas and apartments. Cars are used only by police and for garbage
pickup, and on a summer weekend the air is filled with the
clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages and the shouts of bathers
fleeing Istanbul's heat.
</P>
<P>
   The theological school on Heybeli Island was built in 1844 atop
one of the two hills, on the site of the Holy Trinity monastery and
school, which dated to the ninth century. The school's library is
regarded as one of the richest in the world in old and rare works.
Like the rest of the school, the library is cleaned meticulously
each day by the four clerics and 14 employees who maintain the
school.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader
of the world's 220 million Orthodox Christians and Leader of the
Greek-Orthodox Church, arrived at dockside here aboard a private
boat with an entourage of archbishops and priests. The patriarch's
primary residence is in Istanbul, but he regularly visits the
island to lead services in the school chapel for island residents
and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   As sunbathers gawked, the black-robed, bearded patriarch stepped
agilely into a carriage for a trip up the winding road to the
theological seminary. Like each patriarch before him, Bartholomew,
60, was educated here. Sitting in his sparse quarters after his
arrival, he reminisced painfully about the scholarly atmosphere
during his years here and lamented the seminary's closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a religious institution like the Ecumenical Patriarchate,
which is accepted and recognized throughout the world as the first
seat of the Orthodox Church, it is inconceivable not to have a
school, an educational institution to prepare coming generations,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of Turkey's 75 Greek Orthodox churches are open,
in part because of a shortage of priests. And the population of
ethnic Greeks, with an average age of 60, has been whittled from
150,000 to about 2,500 over a century of expulsions, attrition and
migration, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish authorities have kept the seminary closed partly out of
historic antipathy for the Greeks. But the more pressing fear is
that opening this school would lead to demands for similar freedom
from Islamic religious groups, an element of society on which the
secular government keeps a firm grip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, last spring brought a glimmer of hope. Clinton had
pressed Turkey on the issue in Istanbul the previous November, and
warming relations with Greece seemed to make the timing good.
Opening the school was regarded as a gesture that would keep
progress going. Even President Suleyman Demirel privately supported
the move, church officials had heard.
</P>
<P>
   But Demirel was denied another term, and the pace of improving
relations between Turkey and Greece has lost some momentum in the
continuing disputes over such tough obstacles as boundaries in the
Aegean Sea and how to govern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from both countries have exchanged sharp words in
recent weeks and the two architects of the closer ties, Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey and Foreign Minister George
Papandreou of Greece, postponed a meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greek-Turkish rapprochement will be difficult to sustain if
nothing happens this fall,'' cautioned a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   No one in authority is arguing that relations between the
countries are on the rocks, but prospects for re-opening the
seminary have dimmed. Still, each day the floors are shined and the
library is dusted in preparation for the next class of students.

 &HT;    LONG DELAYS KEEP NEW TECHNOLOGIES OFF ELDERLY MARKET
 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR USE MONDAY, AUG. 7, 2000
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of elderly and disabled Medicare patients
are potentially denied the latest in medical technology because of
bureaucratic delays and inadequate payments, according to a report
being released today. ((Monday))
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared for the Advanced Medical Technology
Association, which represents medical manufacturers, by the Lewin
Group, an independent analytical firm that specializes in health
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Among its findings, the report said:
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) The time between a new device's approval for medical
use and its acceptance by Medicare can range from 15 months to five
years. Patients rarely receive the new technology during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lack of Medicare coverage for a new device or procedure
restricts patient access,'' the report said. ``Although
beneficiaries may pay out-of-pocket for devices that are not
adequately covered under Medicare, they are rarely in a position to
do so in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) Because some devices must be approved by Medicare on a
region-by-region basis, the same technology may not be available
nationwide. Medicare is considering a policy to grant nationwide
approval of new devices. A hearing is likely to be held on that
proposal later this month in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) New Medicare rules will make it tougher for new devices
to be approved for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Care Financing Administration, which operates
Medicare, did not have a reaction to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received a draft copy of this report and we're
reviewing it,'' a HCFA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare often pays the same amount for a new device as for
other devices used in a similar manner, even if the new device is
more costly.
</P>
<P>
   That may result in hospitals ``limiting performance of
procedures, eliminating provision of certain services and using
older and less expensive technologies,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, cochlear implants, which stimulate the ear's
cochlea and help restore hearing in some severely deaf individuals,
were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1984 and by
Medicare two years later. But Medicare has never adjusted its
payment level even though the implants have been refined over the
past 14 years and are now more costly.
</P>
<P>
   The report said hospitals lose about $9,000 for every cochlear
implant performed on an in-patient basis and $5,500 for outpatient
procedures, resulting in some facilities limiting their
availability. The UCLA Audiology Clinic recently closed its
cochlear implant program, citing the high cost and low
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of all patients eligible for cochlear implants
are on Medicare, but only about 15 percent of the implants are
performed on Medicare patients, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Approval delays and low reimbursement levels impose substantial
risks on the companies that develop and manufacture medical
devices, with the result that efforts to improve research and
development may be stifled, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high cost and long timelines that may be required to
secure Medicare payment can delay or even prevent new devices with
demonstrated clinical value from reaching the market,'' the report
said.

OPRAH GOES TO PRESS WITH IDEAS ON LIVING WELL
</HEADLINE>
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gore should ask Oprah to be his vice presidential nominee,'' I
heard an amateur pundit _ one of legions, I'm sure _ declare last
week. Think of what follows as theatrical speculation then, set
against a backdrop of some of the dreariest political performances
we've yet been subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush got a father figure in Dick Cheney, one who
supplies him with authority and stability but who still has to take
a back seat when it comes to visibility and sex appeal. Vice
President Al Gore would get a sister with a touch of the mother in
Oprah Winfrey; she would give him an aura of spontaneity,
generosity and basically sexless titillation. I refer, of course,
to the race angle: Theirs would be a chaste union undertaken solely
for the public good. Tipper Gore's position wouldn't be usurped:
The children are there as visible proof of who the real wife is,
and Oprah's companion, Steadman Graham, would be by Oprah's side,
as proof that everyone goes back to the old neighborhood when day
is done.
</P>
<P>
   And there is great mileage to be gotten from a Tipper-Oprah
alliance (the Tipper-Hillary combination had no chemistry). See
them together: just girlfriends one moment, women of authority the
next, jogging, making speeches, photographed shopping together.
Under Oprah's influence Tipper would show a touch of girlish
soulfulness, while Oprah could add chipper gentility to her
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's influence should not be minimized either. He would
appeal greatly to all those unmarried couples who become
inadmissible evidence whenever politicians start testifying about
family values. And he could set an example for men across the
country who may one day find themselves, if they haven't already,
less famous, less wealthy and less powerful than their wives or
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   An aside here. I wish I fully understood why certain
African-Americans, apart from athletes, take on a cultural value
that is nearly godlike but doesn't transcend race. Maybe it's like
what architects or designers do when they take old materials and
arrange them differently: keep the comforting associations of the
past, while getting the excitement of the present and future.
(``These people are black; I know what that has meant and could
still mean, but I feel completely different!'')
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey and Colin Powell have this value. So do certain
actors who have become the voices and bodies of American industry
and technology. There is James Earl Jones as the body and cellular
soul of Verizon Telephone and Ruby Dee as the voice of life
insurance. (It's a nurturing concept, life insurance; it needs a
woman's voice.) And there is Avery Brooks. He first rose to
television fame as the black hustler helpmate of a white private
eye on ``Spenser: For Hire.'' He now commands a space station on
``Deep Space 9'' and embodies the technological prowess of IBM here
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has achieved Oprah's well-nigh superhuman status. (I
use her first name only because the show and the magazine invite me
to.) Look at the cover of her new monthly magazine, still on
newsstands. Read ``O'' in white boldface with ``The Oprah
Magazine'' just below in a bright square of color, then let your
eye move to a full-page photograph of the woman herself. This is
not a magazine title along the lines of Jane or the now-defunct
Mirabella. This is not a proper noun; it is an idea or way of life,
like Vogue; even a species, along the lines of People. And with its
emphasis on physical, psychological and spiritual evolution, there
is the hint that a new species or at least a new, improved gender
is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Both in her magazine and on her television show, Oprah's name is
used in a queenly manner. Implicitly, her ``I'' is a royal ``we'':
she speaks for us as well as to us. (Don't you wish that Diana,
Princess of Wales, had been a guest on her show? That would have
been one for the ages.) But the process works in reverse, too. We
can be _ in fact we are every day _ royalty, striving for the same
kinds of material and spiritual blessings Oprah strives for and, in
the case of material blessings, clearly has won. What's hers is
ours, it seems: the magazine's sensible psychologist, Dr. Phillip
C. McGraw, and its spiritual advice giver, Gary Zukav, both appear
on the talk show and are introduced as Oprah's personal counselors.
Her cook appears too, as do members of her book club.
</P>
<P>
   What a brilliant businesswoman and media star: mogul plus . . .
well, in the early days I would have said updated matriarch, but
she has rechanneled the matriarchal associations that almost
inevitably trail a black woman who can talk at all soulfully and is
not Naomi Campbell thin. Now she is a national care giver, a
national therapist (how smart she was to play Ellen DeGeneres'
therapist on the episode in which she came out) and a
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the ``fabulously wealthy'' John Beresford Tipton on
that old television show ``The Millionaire,'' who anonymously
bestowed fortunes on ordinary citizens to see if they could use the
money wisely and become better people? Oprah is a real-life
extension of this fantasy, bestowing gifts on her television
audiences _ food, CDs, Palm Pilots _ and opportunities for
self-enhancement and self-discipline on all her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live Your Best Life!'' is O's motto. The magazine teaches
informed selflessness and enlightened selfishness. And it does so
very well, adapting and expanding on elements of women's, general
interest and celebrity magazines. Learn to control your temper;
learn to give yourself flowers and candles; learn about community
organizers and how to become one yourself; learn how famous women
cured themselves of ``the disease to please''; take the pull-outs
of quotes from famous people (the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
Epictetus, Joe E. Lewis) and tape them to your mirror or mail them
to friends.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue is laid out like a four-step program. The
articles in ``First Words'' are about improving one's life in the
world, from handling money to learning from failure. Then comes
``Live Your Best Life'' with an inward focus: how to meditate, how
to give yourself solitude. Now you are ready for pleasure: ``Enjoy
Yourself'' with fashion, health and beauty ideas. And lastly come
``Features,'' which include Oprah's interview with a famous woman
(Jane Fonda here), profiles, pieces on sex and on aging, and, from
other famous women (Hillary Clinton this time), books that have
made a difference in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine ends with a brief coda called ``. . . and More''
which beautifully recapitulates the themes of Oprah's ministry and
marketing genius. There is a full page of beauty products meant to
``go with'' the articles you have just read on fashion, food and
the home. And there is Oprah's last word, a spiritual anecdote
called ``What I Know for Sure,'' with one last photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Oprah Winfrey need to be a politician? She is already
a business impresario and a media empress.

NEWSPAPER FUELS `MEGAN'S LAW' CONTROVERSY IN ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Sara in 8th graf is cq) 
By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain said Sunday that it would ``urgently'' press
for stricter laws on child molesting but resisted widespread calls
for public identification of released violators that have been
associated with current vigilante attacks across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Home Office Minister Paul Boateng pledged that the government
would strengthen laws protecting children from sexual abuse, but he
said, ``The decisions about whether or not people are told names
and addresses are not matters for newspapers, they are not matters
for ministers, they are matters for police and the probation
service.''
</P>
<P>
   His newspaper reference was to Britain's top selling tabloid,
The Sunday News of the World, which under the headline ``Name and
Shame'' has been running photographs and whereabouts of men
convicted of molesting children who have been released from prison.
Although the paper had promised to name 100,000, it ended the
practice Sunday after publishing only 82.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch mob attacks and firebombings have occurred in 11 different
communities in England and Scotland since the campaign began two
weeks ago, the majority of them at homes of people wrongly
identified as suspected pedophiles or confused with people with
similar names and appearances as people pictured by the newspaper.
A rioting crowd of 150, many carrying signs with the emotive News
of the World headline, overturned vehicles, smashed windows and
threw stones and rocks at police Thursday and Friday nights in
Plymouth in Southern England.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, which is owned by the press magnate Rupert
Murdoch, has been condemned by police officials and human rights
groups arguing that its campaign has actually further endangered
children by driving sex offenders underground. ``The government's
concern has to be the protection and welfare of children and the
maintenance of public order,'' said Boateng. ``The News of the
World approach to this issue in naming and shaming threatened
both.''
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper said it was abandoning its effort only because
it had started an ``unstoppable force'' for a law for public
identification of known offenders. It said 300,000 people had
already signed a petition for a law that would let parents see
registers of convicted pedophiles in their area, and it printed
forms for its 4.1 million readers to sign and send to the
government, with the promise of a receiving a ``badge of pride'' to
wear.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after the so-called ``Megan's Law'' in the United
States, the British version is being promoted as ``Sarah's Law,''
in memory of an 8-year-old girl named Sarah Payne, who was abducted
last month near her grandparents' home and later found dead and
naked off a country path after a search that aroused front page
sympathy throughout Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Sara Payne, 31, made affecting televised
daily appeals for her daughter's return during the two weeks that
police combed fields in Surrey, and she was pictured on Sunday's
News of the World front page endorsing the campaign and helping
count signed petitions.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law, a New Jersey statute that all 49 other U.S. states
have used as the model for similar laws, was created in 1994 in
response to the brutal rape and murder of Megan Kanka, 7, of
Hamilton Township, by a twice-convicted sex offender who was living
across the street unbeknownst to her parents. Under the law, all
sex offenders must register with the police, and community
organizations involved with children are alerted to the presence of
those who are considered to be potentially repeat offenders. The
law counsels a number of preventative steps and explicitly rules
out verbal and physical vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Howard, known as a strict law and order official when he
served as Britain's home secretary in the last Conservative
government, warned Saturday that proposals for public surveillance
would lead to vigilantism ``that no civilized society could
tolerate'' and could increase risks to children by discouraging
released sex offenders from registering with police at the high
level they do now. He said the level in Britain was 97 percent _
the highest compliance of any country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Boateng did not detail what steps he was contemplating to redeem
his pledge to tighten up procedures, but the government is known to
be looking at proposals for longer sentencing, including life terms
with no possibility of parole.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of The News of the World, Rebekah Wade, said, ``As a
result of our naming and shaming campaign I believe the
introduction of Sarah's Law is now inevitable.'' She cited that as
the reason the newspaper had ended the campaign and added, ``Our
job now is to force the government to act _ and we'll name and
shame every politician who stands in our way.''

`MAGIC TERROR': INTENDED EFFECTS DON'T QUITE WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the clever exercises in horror that compose Peter Straub's
latest work of fiction, ``Magic Terror: Seven Tales,'' the most
successful is the brief ``Ashputtle,'' which takes its title from
the German version of ``Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   Here the narrator is Mrs. Asch, ``the Mrs. being entirely
honorific, no husband having ever been in evidence, nor ever likely
to be.'' She is a psychopathic ``female kindergarten teacher in her
50s who happens to be very fat.'' She begins: ``People think that
teaching little children has something to do with helping other
people, something to do with service. People think that if you
teach little children, you must love them. People get what they
need from thoughts like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Asch sees herself as both the victim of a wicked stepmother
and the wicked stepmother, too. During the course of her ramblings,
she reveals that one of her students ``has been lost.'' She
reports: ``A lost child lies deep within the ashes, her hands and
feet mutilated, her face destroyed by fire. She has partaken of the
great adventure, and now she is the same as all nature.'' She may
or may not be aware that she herself is responsible for this loss,
but the reader becomes aware, and the effect is chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Straub is often equally as adept but rarely as
successful. In the much longer ``Bunny Is Good Bread,'' the
psychopathic point of view is 5-year-old Fee Bandolier's as he
watches his alcoholic father gradually battering his mother to
death and is sexual molested by a man in a movie theater.
Inevitably he becomes a serial murderer, joins the Army and is
accepted for Special Forces training. But for all the skill of the
narrative, the conclusion is announced instead of experienced, and
you feel the author's elbow in your ribs.
</P>
<P>
   A similar tendentiousness mars ``Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff,'' a
grotesque homage to Melville's ``Bartleby the Scrivener'' that won
a 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Horror. Here a puritanical Wall Street
tycoon who uses $10 words where nickel ones would do describes how
he hired a Gallagher-and-Shean-type vaudeville team of ``private
detectives extraordinaire'' to punish his wife for cheating on him
with his business partner.
</P>
<P>
   The two detectives turn out to be sadistic torturers who move
into the narrator's office and take over his life. But instead of
infusing the story with the inevitable yet indefinable, as
Bartleby's protest does, they merely teach the banal lesson that he
who lives by the pickax and screwdriver dies by them.
</P>
<P>
   For fans of Straub's fiction (``Ghost Story,'' ``The Hellfire
Club,'' ``Mr. X,'' among other novels of terror and the
supernatural), there are many puzzles to work out in ``Magic
Terror'': echoes of his earlier fiction, references to writers the
author admires. ``The Ghost Village,'' a heavy-handed Conradian war
story set in the battle jungles of Vietnam, reintroduces the
characters who first appeared in the novel ``Koko.'' The sexual
molestation in ``Bunny Is Good Bread'' develops a central incident
in ``The Juniper Tree,'' one of the better stories in Straub's
impressive earlier collection ``Houses Without Doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever he may be up to with his echoes and leitmotifs, his
main concern here seems to be narrative virtuosity. Repeatedly in
``Magic Terror,'' he clutches the reader by the collar. In ``Isn't
It Romantic?'' a Bond-like operative identified only as N sets out
on a mission in the French Pyrenees entailing good food, fast cars,
esoteric trade talk and sexy women. In ``Porkpie Hat'' a jazz fan
interviews a brilliant saxophonist he calls Hat (based on Lester
Young) and induces him to tell a ghost story from his boyhood.
``Hunger, an Introduction'' seduces with the magniloquence of the
autodidact.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, few of Straub's intended effects quite come off.
The fate of smooth N is obvious almost from the beginning of
``Isn't It Romantic?'' ``The Ghost Village'' sends the not very
fresh message that the violence of Vietnam came home to the States.
The story within the story in ``Porkpie Hat'' is boring and
obscure. ``Hunger, an Introduction'' ends on a lovely, lyric note
without clear meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In the greatest of ghost stories, like ``The Beckoning Fair
One,'' by Oliver Onions, or ``Silent Snow, Secret Snow,'' by Conrad
Aiken, the narrative invades those recesses of your mind that you
don't quite trust and makes the disintegration of something
familiar seem irresistible. In ``Magic Terror'' Straub now and then
entertains you. But his characters are mostly aliens, shadows on
the face of the moon. &QL;

AYATOLLAH CRUSHES PRESS REFORMS IN IRAN  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Squashing a cherished goal of President Mohammad
Khatami and his reformist allies, Iran's supreme religious leader
Sunday sided conclusively with the country's conservatives and
ordered the Parliament to scrap a bill aimed at restoring a free
and lively press.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise intervention by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
country's top Muslim cleric, stunned reformers, dashing their hopes
of using their newly won strength in Parliament to push through
reforms, and set off scuffles and loud arguments in the chambers.
Sixty liberal members walked out in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law to liberalize the press was the centerpiece of
Khatami's reform program for the new Parliament and followed many
months during which liberal newspapers had been shut down and their
editors and writers jailed. The 22nd newspaper was closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary showdown was a decisive moment in the struggle
between liberal and conservative forces that has simmered in the
three years since the reform-minded president was swept to power on
an electoral landslide generated largely by a youthful electorate
that has come of age since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   That battle took on new momentum with the victory of reform
politicians in parliamentary elections six months ago. But since
then, Khatami's supporters have suffered successive blows as
conservative courts have denied them a voice to reach the public in
the press.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two months, the pro-Khatami forces had said that
their chief aim was to pass a new press law that would permit a
resumption of the lively public debate over the direction of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In quashing the reformers' paramount goal Sunday and refusing
even to permit a debate on the bill, Khamenei took the exceptional
move of circumventing the normal institutional checks on
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Parliament, while directly elected, is relatively
weak. Any law it passes must be approved by the Council of
Guardians, a conservative clerical body. A law rejected by the
council can then be appealed by the Parliament to another group,
the Expediency Council, which is also dominated by hard-liners.
Only then _ at least until Sunday _ did the supreme leader
intervene to make a final decision about the constitutionality of a
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Khamenei, who owes his position to the powerful
religious hierarchy, had succeeded in appearing to give a little
support to each side of the political divide.
</P>
<P>
   He has effusively praised the president as a good Muslim who is
a true heir to the values of the Islamic Revolution. In late May,
just days before the new Parliament was to open, he pressured the
Council of Guardians to end its long delay in certifying the
reformists' election victory in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   But Khamenei has also provided ammunition to hard-liners,
endorsing their judicial crackdown on the pro-Khatami press and
labeling reformers as hirelings of foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the Parliament and read out in the chambers
Sunday, the ayatollah said he considered the proposed new press law
a threat to the fundamental pillars of the clergy-run system in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be great danger to the national security and people's
faith if the enemies of the Islamic Revolution control or
infiltrate the press,'' he wrote. ``The present press law has
prevented such disaster so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The press law now in effect gives the courts, which are
dominated by conservatives, the power to close newspapers summarily
and to control who owns or works for them. It was passed in the
waning days of the previous Parliament, which was controlled by
religious hard-liners opposed to Khatami's program of social
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed press law, drafted by one of Khatami's government
ministries, would have restored some independence for media and
required hearings before juries before the closing of any
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Karrubi, the Parliament speaker, said Khamenei, who has
held his post since 1988, had the constitutional power to order the
lawmakers to stop consideration of a bill. The system, he said, is
based on submission to the ``absolute rule of the supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   That view, however, was disputed by reformist members of the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision should have been put to a vote,'' said Ali
Tajernia, a reformist Parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Once the letter was read, the room erupted in shouts and some
members began shoving each other. In the heat of the moment, one
reformer, Mohammad Rashidian, ignored religious and political
protocol by referring to the supreme leader simply as ``Khamenei,''
without an honorific. He was immediately condemned by conservative
members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Since the closure of most reformist newspapers, leaders of the
pro-Khatami camp have pleaded for public calm in the face of the
crackdown by conservatives. Last month, however, angry students
demonstrated in front of the Parliament, calling for change.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidreza Jalaipour, who helped found and run five different
now-banned daily newspapers, said journalists still had no choice
other than caution. But he said new publications would continue to
appear in an effort to test the boundaries of political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result will be that newspapers and journals will continue
to publish under new licenses and different names every time they
are shut down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some reform members said they held out hope that Khamenei could
be convinced to change his mind. Fathimeh Haghighatjoo, a
representative from Tehran, said reformers were planning to write
to the leader to explain why a more unfettered press would be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can solve obstacles such as what happened Sunday
if we have closer ties with the leader,'' she said. ``The problem
is that the constitution is vague when it explains the duties of
the Parliament and the supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system put in place after the Iranian monarchy was
uprooted by the Islamic revolution, the supreme leader controls the
military, security, courts and all broadcast media in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Only the president, the Parliament and some municipal councils
are elected.

MUSIC REVIEW: VAN CLIBURN DOES A REPRISE AT TANGLEWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ It is not often that Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique''
Symphony is chosen to open a program, as it was here at Tanglewood
Friday night in a concert given by the Boston Symphony, led by
Seiji Ozawa. The symphony's ominously quiet opening works better if
an audience is already settled, and the desolate conclusion, in an
effective performance, leaves little more to be said or even hoped
for.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is not often that the soloist of the evening is
of the caliber and reputation of Van Cliburn. Cliburn seldom
performs these days, and when he does, it is almost always in
Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, more or less replicating the
performance that established his career overnight at the
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was here, with Cliburn inevitably bringing down the
house to end the night with desolation far behind, leaving a
sizable crowd of 11,500 with warm memories. With warmer memories,
in this listener's case, than when Cliburn was last heard, nine
years ago in the same work with the New York Philharmonic as part
of Carnegie Hall's centenary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   On that occasion, Cliburn's first New York appearance in many
years, he appeared nervous and ill at ease. Here he seemed more in
his element despite a few momentary derailments in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the interpretation was big, broad and raw-boned,
occasionally suggesting, in its awesome power, some of what the
young Cliburn must have sounded like. He positively thundered in
the climactic octave runs near the end. But the voluptuary sound
one might have expected was often undercut by a heavy, percussive
touch, and Cliburn's vaunted lyricism was hampered by a sense of
stop and go rather than ebb and flow.
</P>
<P>
   True, some of that discontinuity, especially in the first
movement, seemed a function of searching, and it was moving to see
Cliburn still trying to plumb depths of meaning in this piece after
so many repetitions. Yet it is hard to know what he expects to
find.
</P>
<P>
   This is, by and large, a young performer's music, preferring
ready sentiment and sheer visceral excitement to profundity of
thought. The excitement Cliburn conjured in his youth may be better
reflected nowadays in a performance like the one Evgeny Kissin
gave, also with Ozawa and the Boston Symphony, to open the Carnegie
Hall season in 1995 (with the ``Pathetique'' also on the program).
</P>
<P>
   That interpretation _ fleet, fluid, playful and mercurial _
could hardly have been more different from the one here. But
Kissin's clear-eyed youthful impetus and the gleeful virtuosity
swept all before it, leaving a tired war horse sounding like a
fresh, clean masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa followed Cliburn's comings and goings with a masterly
hand, insuring a coherence the proceedings might easily have
lacked. And Ozawa's work in the symphony was hardly less
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Pathetique'' is another overworked standard needing
constant revivification, and there was no particular reason to
expect it from Ozawa and the Boston Symphony, whose work together
in recent years has often exuded a sense of weary routine. But here
was a polished performance (almost overpolished at the start) that
looked for depth in all the right places.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa imparted an epic breadth to the first movement, and the
orchestra managed to sustain the line over long spans. The quiet
moments so crucial to this work were just what they needed to be:
dark and oppressive yet intense and charged with mystery. William
R. Hudgins was superb in the clarinet solos, whether singing in
eloquent full voice or murmuring in velvety pianissimos.
</P>
<P>
   When Ozawa announced last year that he intended to leave the
orchestra in 2002, few doubted that the time was ripe for change.
Yet on evidence like this, his tenure still holds the promise of
bearing rich final fruits.
</P>
<P>
   For a music director, lame-duck status may carry more than
diminishing power, as the orchestra, coming to realize that choice
specialties of the collaboration are being revisited for perhaps
the last time, plays with renewed ardor. There may be excitement in
Boston even before 2002.

A SON OF THE SUBURBS RISES TO THE HELM OF AN EMBATTLED GREENPEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not so odd that a graduate of the '80s with a
master's degree in economics and some supply-side credentials
should now find himself negotiating a big merger.
</P>
<P>
   But this merger would combine two environmental organizations,
one obscure and one famous, Ozone Action and Greenpeace. The
buzzwords might be the same as in the world of corporate deals _
``synergy'' comes to mind _ but the objectives could not be more
different.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is not a certainty _ the two groups' boards are still
thinking it over. But whether or not it succeeds , John
Passacantando, co-founder and executive director of Ozone Action,
will be moving to Greenpeace USA as its executive director. At age
38, he will take charge of one of the best-known groups in
environmentalism after years of upheaval. Greenpeace's entire board
resigned several months ago amid disputes over the group's internal
organization, staffing and overall direction.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace USA's membership is about 300,000, way down from the
1 million members it claimed several years ago. It has a yearly
budget of about $20 million, raised mostly by costly direct mail
(door-to-door canvassing is a thing of the past). Its staff numbers
about 70, after steep reductions under its former director, Kristen
Engberg.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some cultural similarities, Ozone Action is built quite
differently. Ozone Action has a network of a few thousand
volunteers, but no members; its budget of $1.3 million comes mostly
from family foundations, and its staff numbers about a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups are based in Washington, but Greenpeace reports back
to Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. Ozone Action focuses
narrowly on pollution that causes global warming or thins the
earth's protective ozone layer. Greenpeace's agenda is much
broader, taking in everything from saving whales to opposing
genetically modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   But the two groups share something important, Passacantando
said: an appreciation for attention-grabbing theatrics, carried out
on the streets or on the high seas, in support of their
nitty-gritty policy objectives.
</P>
<P>
   And for this lanky and sincere son of the suburbs, the trip to
the helm of Greenpeace's ship has meant getting used to these
ruckus-raising tactics known in the trade as ``direct action.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Ozone Action's events are moderate in tone _ bringing
ambassadors from small island states to attend town meetings on
global warming or building Web pages that use government data to
illustrate increases in heat waves. But a few months ago,
Passacantando, along with the president of Friends of the Earth and
a few others, was arrested at the headquarters of the World Bank in
Washington during protests of the April meetings of the
international monetary organizations. They tried to hang a banner
denouncing energy development and to disrupt traffic with a
disabled truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow you can find a way that is outrageous and fun, but
still fair and ethical, to speak the truth to power,'' he says of
tactics like this. ``That's a fun job to go to every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't always like this. Growing up in Whippany, N.J., the
son of a father who sold insurance and a mother who left a research
job to raise him and his younger brother and sister, Passacantando
liked to camp, hike and fish with his dad, but wasn't preoccupied
by the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under the false conviction, well conveyed to me during
the Reagan years, that the era of movements was over. I had missed
the civil rights movement, and I thought, `What a shame.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He sold computer systems, then was hired by Jude Wanniski's
Polyconomics Inc. to do economic research for Wall Street. ``In
fact, very conservative research, supply-side research,'' he
recalled. ``It was pro-development, without any regard for
sustainability.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile he got a masters' degree in economics at New York
University. But his world view was starting to change.
</P>
<P>
   He was reading John Muir and Rachel Carson, farmer-philosopher
Wendell Berry and eco-spiritualist the Rev. Thomas Berry. And he
became involved ``as a minor player'' in a local development
dispute in Morristown.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bill Moyers, the head of the Florence and John Schumann
Foundation in Montclair, took him aboard and gave him the the
assignment of encouraging ``a grass-roots renewal of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The work brought him into contact with environmental advocates _
people like Michael Clark, who was building a coalition to protect
the Yellowstone ecosystem, and Jeff DeBonis, who was organizing
green-leaning professionals in the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that there was, after all, a movement of activists all
over the country; it just did not get through the veil,'' he says.
``There was a wonderful buzz in our democracy, which I had not been
seeing, which I did not see in college. This is my generation's
great battle, and I wanted to be in the trenches.''

<P>
   In July 1993, he co-founded Ozone Action, taking the name from
the crisis over the ozone hole caused by emissions of
chlorofluorocarbons. His co-founder was Karen Lohr, a Greenpeace
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups' styles still differ considerably. Ozone Action
has been training 200 students to report on corporate attempts to
influence the global warming negotiations in the Hague,
Netherlands. Greenpeace, meanwhile, has been driving its boats
obstreperously into the path of a Star Wars missile test.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no real culture gap, says Passacantando, who hopes
his team would fit right in after a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenpeace took what the American colonists did at the Tea
Party and really did develop it to an art form,'' he said. ``And
what you have now is an organization that is stabilized, that came
out of a steep fall for the last decade, and really wants its
leadership to get its creative work going again.''

   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ Oliver Cruz can barely read and write. He
has an IQ of either 64 or 76, depending on the test. He flunked the
seventh grade three times. He was rejected by the Army after
failing the entrance exam three times and, unable to decipher a job
application, he did whatever menial work came his way, cutting
grass, cleaning house and taking tickets for a traveling carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 33, he has spent 12 years on death row in Livingston for
the rape and murder of a 24-year-old woman, Kelly Donovan, who was
stationed at the Air Force base in Cruz's hometown, San Antonio.
Cruz, who in an interview last week took full responsibility for
his crime and expressed anguished remorse, is scheduled to die by
lethal injection on Wednesday at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who was in special education classes in school, has been
classified as mentally retarded by psychologists for the defense.
The state did not dispute this at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz awaits execution at a time when there is growing opposition
across the country to the execution of the mentally retarded.
Federal law, approved by President Ronald Reagan, bars the
execution of the mentally retarded who are convicted in federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 states that permit capital punishment, 13 have laws
that prohibit execution of the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush, who, like his brother George, is a
strong supporter of the death penalty, told reporters in April that
``people with clear mental retardation should not be executed,''
and a spokesman said recently that Jeb Bush still held that
position. The chairman of the state's Republican Party has recently
pledged to support legislation that would ban the execution of the
mentally retarded in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush has opposed laws that would
prohibit the execution of the mentally retarded, a position that he
still holds, a spokeswoman, Linda Edwards, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush believes that the jury should consider all the
evidence regarding mental impairment and decide whether a death
sentence is appropriate, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation barring the execution of a defendant whose IQ is
below 65 passed the Republican-dominated Texas Senate last year but
died in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said that he
was optimistic about the bill passing next year and that he would
try to raise the IQ limit to 70, which is what it is in several
other states. ``The national and international attention to the
death penalty in Texas has created some momentum,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's lawyer, Jeffrey Pokorak, has asked Bush and the Texas
State Board of Pardons and Paroles for a stay of execution. Pokorak
says he hopes he can postpone the scheduled date for Cruz's lethal
injection at least until next spring, when the legislation that
might save his life will be considered. He wants a full evidentiary
hearing on Cruz's mental condition.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak said a defense psychologist's review of Cruz's school
records showed that they had classified him as ``educable mentally
retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bexar County district attorney, Susan D. Reed, whose office
prosecuted Cruz, said in an interview last week that she opposed
Cruz's request for clemency, primarily because of what she
described as the heinous nature of his crime. ``Here's a woman
abducted off the street, kidnapped, raped, stabbed 20 times,'' Reed
said. She added that Cruz had a history of violence and had once
fired a shotgun at a man. The man did not press charges, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the evidence about Cruz's mental retardation
was ``conflicting.''
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of Americans support the death penalty, state
polls show that most of those supporters make an exception for the
mentally retarded, even in the fiercely pro-death-penalty state of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association, which does not have a position on
the death penalty in general, but is opposed to executing the
mentally retarded, has written to Bush asking that he grant a
reprieve to Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose the execution of the mentally retarded do not
argue that such people should not be held accountable for their
crimes or be severely punished. What they contend is that the
mentally retarded should not be considered so morally culpable that
they deserve the ultimate punishment, which is supposed to be
reserved for criminals who commit the most heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many of the more than 3,600 death-row
inmates in the United States are mentally retarded, but experts put
the number at about 10 percent, said James Ellis, a leading expert
on mental retardation and the death penalty, and a professor at the
University of New Mexico law school.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 34 people who were known to be mentally
retarded have been executed since the Supreme Court reinstated the
death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, an organization that is opposed to the death penalty.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   One of George W. Bush's first acts as governor, in January 1995,
was to reject a request for clemency for Mario Marquez, who
suffered from severe brain damage, and who had an IQ of 60 and the
skills of a 7-year-old. Marquez was executed on the evening of
Bush's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be God's gardener and take care of the animals,''
Marquez told his lawyer, Robert McGlasson, a few hours before being
strapped onto the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   McGlasson recalled in an interview last week, ``It was like
talking to a 5-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Corrections, said the department does not know how many of the 459
death-row inmates are mentally retarded. The prison has IQ test
scores only for those inmates who might have been tested during an
earlier incarceration, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   One death-row inmate is Doil Lane, whose IQ has been tested at
between 62 and 70, and who has the emotional and intellectual
development of an 8-year-old child, said his lawyer, William
Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was convicted of the rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl,
with the case against him consisting largely of his own confession,
Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on mental retardation say that the mentally retarded
often confess to things they have not done, in part because they
want to please. Allison said Lane's confession was false. ``Given
time, you could get him to confess to anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Allison noted that his client was so childlike that after he
confessed, he climbed into the lap of a Texas Ranger to whom he had
confessed. At his trial, Allison requested a crayon so he could
color pictures. The judge would not let him have one.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, now 39, still longs for crayons. ``I like to clore
((color)) in my clorel ((coloring)) book but you all tuck ((took))
away my clores when you can not hurt no one with a box 24 clores,
just in my book,'' he wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   It took no prodding from the police for Cruz to confess to his
crime, and Cruz's lawyer does not dispute his guilt. But an older
man, Jerry Kemplin, was with Cruz for the rape and murder. Kemplin,
like Cruz, was initially indicted for capital murder, but he did
not confess to anything, instead accepting a plea bargain in
exchange for testimony against Cruz. Kemplin was sentenced to 65
years, with the possibility of parole after serving a quarter of
his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart guy who doesn't confess, who knows better than to
give evidence against himself, gets the deal,'' said Pokorak,
Cruz's lawyer. ``But the guy who is retarded, who doesn't
understand all the words of his Miranda warning, he gets death.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that a person is mentally retarded who has a
significantly subaverage intelligence, which is generally defined
as an IQ below 70, and who consequently has serious difficulties
coping with routine aspects of daily life, in school and at work.
</P>
<P>
   The condition must have existed since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Mental retardation is distinct from mental illness, although the
two may exist in the same individual.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly publicized case of Ricky Ray Rector, the Arkansas
inmate executed while Bill Clinton was governor but was running for
president, Rector's lawyers argued that he was so mentally impaired
that he did not even know he was about to be executed. But Rector's
condition was not considered mental retardation, because it did not
reach back to his childhood. It was caused when he shot away part
of his brain at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The test for whether a defendant is mentally retarded is not the
same test used to determine whether a defendant is insane and
therefore not guilty by reason of insanity. That requires a
defendant to show that he did not know right from wrong. A person
who is able to make this ethical judgment may still be classified
as mentally retarded, depending on IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak is not arguing that Cruz should not have been convicted
by reason of insanity, but that he should not be executed, because
he is mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the lack of precise data about the number of
mentally retarded death-row inmates is that the mentally retarded
themselves struggle to hide their disability, even though in many
cases it is the one thing that might save them from execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather pass as normal than stand up and say `I have
a disability,''' said Timothy Derning, a psychologist in Lafayette,
Calif., who has testified as an expert witness for defendants in
many capital murder trials. ``They have been called `stupid' and
`retards' their whole life, so who wants to say they are mentally
retarded?''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in a holding cell on death row last week, Cruz had a
pained expression as he answered questions about his lawyer's
emphasis on his mental retardation in the effort to spare him from
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to be in that category, that I'm retarded or
stupid,'' Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also recalled his frustration with school, which he said
had led to his dropping out at age 16. ``I was slow in reading,
slow in learning,'' he said. ``Maybe I was a loser. The teacher
would say, `Read this chapter.' I couldn't read.''
</P>
<P>
   He added proudly, ``Now I can write a letter, a half a page.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz did not appear to know what it meant to be mentally
retarded. ``I'm not retarded,'' he said. ``I'm not the kind of
person who is going to go out and hurt people for the fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed his crime to his being drunk and on LSD. But he
also said, ``I'm not going to use this as an excuse for what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was wrong,'' he said. ``I feel real bad about it.
There's nothing I can do to change it, bring that person back. I
want to make things right.'' His eyes filling with tears, he said
that half of him had died that night along with the woman he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep me locked up,'' he added. ``But don't kill me. I know I
could help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the interview, Cruz put his head in his hands
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Talking in her office in San Antonio, Reed, the district
attorney, raised doubts about Cruz's mental retardation. Noting the
two different IQ scores, of 64 and 76, she said, ``I'm not going to
say that he is or he is not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the jury had heard the evidence about his mental
retardation and had reached its verdict, and that she supported the
jury's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak said that the jury had not been properly instructed to
consider evidence of mental retardation, as required by Supreme
Court rulings. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled recently
that while the instruction had not been given, it was not a fatal
constitutional error. Cruz filed an appeal on Friday with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On the general issue of whether the mentally retarded should be
executed, Reed said, ``I'm not willing to make a broad statement
for or against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people charged with capital murder are poor, and so are
represented by appointed lawyers. Many of these lawyers are
inexperienced, and even incompetent, and they often fail during the
mitigation phase of the trial to present the evidence of mental
retardation that could persuade the jury to spare their client's
life.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Ramon Martinez-Villareal is on death row after being
convicted of murdering two people. He has an IQ of 50 and also
suffers from brain damage, schizophrenia and dementia, according to
evidence presented by his lawyers in various appeals.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Martinez-Villareal's lawyer did not mention
his client's mental retardation. Martinez-Villareal, meanwhile, was
not able to tell the difference between the spectators and the
jury, his trial lawyer testified at a later hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the evidence of Martinez-Villareal's mental retardation,
brought out by Martinez-Villareal's postconviction attorneys, has
emerged, the trial judge and the prosecutor have said that
Villareal should not be executed. Nevertheless, Martinez-Villareal
remains on death row.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case involving a Texas death-row inmate, Johnny
Paul Penry, the Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that executing someone
who was mentally retarded was not ``cruel and unusual punishment''
in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, reversed the conviction of Penry for rape
and murder because the jury had not been instructed during the
mitigation phase of the trial that it could take into account his
mental condition in deciding whether to give him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Penry, who suffered brain damage at birth, and has an IQ of
about 60 and the mental ability of a 7-year-old, is still on death
row. His lawyers are preparing to return to Supreme Court. Now they
may win the argument that executing the mentally retarded is
unconstitutional, death penalty lawyers and constitutional scholars
say.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in Penry in 1989, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said that a ``national consensus'' had not developed
against executing the mentally retarded. At the time, only Georgia
and Maryland prohibited doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Since then 11 states have enacted laws that prohibit these
executions _ Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, and
Washington. Five other states came close to passing laws during
their most recent legislative sessions _ Illinois, Missouri,
Arizona, Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not said how many states would constitute
a ``national consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of the rights of the mentally retarded, one
of the strongest laws is Nebraska's, said Jerry Soucie, a lawyer
with the Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy, a state agency
that represents indigents in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was pushed by advocates for the mentally retarded
and the Roman Catholic Church, says that a person with an IQ below
70 is presumed to be mentally retarded, and requires a judge to
vacate a death sentence imposed before the law was passed, if he
finds by a ``preponderance of the evidence'' that the person was
mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was passed, two of the 10 men then on death row
had their sentences commuted to life in prison. One had an IQ of
68, the other 65.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois does not have a law prohibiting execution of the
mentally retarded, but Anthony Porter's mental deficiencies saved
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who was sentenced to die for the murder of two people,
and who has an IQ of 51, was 48 hours away from execution when the
state Supreme Court granted him a reprieve so that his mental
retardation could be investigated. The reprieve gave investigators
time to uncover evidence of Porter's innocence, and last year he
was exonerated and released from prison.

   NEW YORK _ As the heat was beginning to rise from the pavement
late Sunday morning, 115th Street between Lenox and Fifth avenues
was as white as snow. Hundreds of people, dressed from head to foot
in white cotton dresses, slacks and shirts, were arriving by the
bus load and gathering in the center of the avenue for a baptism by
fire hose.
</P>
<P>
   Each August since 1937, the United House of Prayer, a
nondenominational Pentecostal church that claims 3 million
congregants in 28 states, has held mass baptisms on 115th Street in
East Harlem, using a fire hose to spray hundreds of participants
with baptismal waters.
</P>
<P>
   The church holds mass baptisms across the country each summer as
part of a convocation ceremony in which congregants seek holy
renewal. In most places, as many as 2,000 congregants will be
submerged in a local river or a pool. But in New York, where access
to rivers is limited and where pools aren't easy to find, the House
of Prayer has always used the municipal water supply, blessed by
the church's bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptism is a faith thing and has nothing to do with the actual
water,'' explained Apostle H.M. Swaringer, the pastor of Harlem's
chapter, on Frederick Douglass Boulevard and 125th Street. ``In the
scripture in places where there was no water, they used the clouds.
It's all according to the conditions, what's available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many church members travel to different regions of the county
for baptisms that take place throughout the summer. This year,
about 500 congregants gathered for Sunday's New York regional
ceremony, with buses arriving from Washington, Boston and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Helena and Gracie Myrick, sisters from Baltimore, said they got
up at 3 a.m. Sunday to make the four-hour trip to East Harlem. Both
said they were baptized every year, as their 91-year-old father had
been for years, not just in New York, but in each of the 13 states
that participate in the House of Prayer annual convocations.
</P>
<P>
   The baptism began just before noon, after the church's national
leader, Bishop S.C. Madison, arrived from Charlotte, N.C., and
ascended the stage to rousing Southern swing music played by four
brass bands. Congregants clapped and danced, and waved their hands
in the air, as some put on shower caps and bathing caps, or draped
towels over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask the Lord to bless the water of the New York reservoir,''
Madison said to the joyful assembly. ``I ask him to change this
water to the water of the river Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a church official unleashed the torrent, and water from a
fire hose attached to a city hydrant sprayed high into the air,
pouring down on congregants for a 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Some people shook their heads and grimaced at the cold spray,
others danced to the music of the brass bands, some dropped to the
ground and a few threw their hands in the air as if to grasp the
falling blessing. When the deluge ended, drenched participants
straggled off, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you feel good, relaxed,'' said Rose M. King, 41, a
Harlem resident, shivering in a soaked T-shirt. ``It takes all the
evil away.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 1920s until almost midcentury, the House of Prayer's
church stood on 115th Street between Lenox and Fifth avenues. It
was demolished in 1947 to make way for a public housing
development, the Martin Luther King Jr. Houses.
</P>
<P>
   Church members return to the street every year to honor their
old house of worship, and some who live in the surrounding
neighborhood have come to see the convocation ceremony as part of
their own tradition.
</P>
<P>
   George A. Donaldson, who moved into the King Houses with his
family in 1951, when only half the project had been completed, said
he and his former neighbors planned their annual reunion each
summer to coincide with the House of Prayer ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who grew up on 115th Street and Fifth is naturally
going to want to come out for this,'' said Donaldson, who greeted
old neighbors as he watched the convocation from the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a group of tenements across the street and
most of the residents there were members of the church, so you can
imagine how it used to be. Since then, everyone has scattered. But
this has such a strong pull that it brings everyone back every
year.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the southwest will deliver much warmer air to the
Middle Atlantic states and most of the Northeast. Cool, damp
conditions will be slow to leave parts of eastern and northern New
England. A broken area of strong thunderstorms will erupt during
midday in the humid air from the Ohio Valley to the central
Appalachians. Scattered thundershowers will reach the Northeast
coast by evening.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm air will cover a large area from the interior West
across the southern and central Plains to the Southeast. A few
thunderstorms will form near the periphery of the hot air mass from
the northern Rockies to the Dakotas. Meanwhile, a slow-moving
disturbance will promote clouds and scattered thundershowers in
Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Alberto with winds of 80 mph will continue moving west
1500 miles east of the Windward Islands.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DOG DAYS
</P>
<P>
   Daytime temperatures in the 90s, hazy skies hiding random
thunderstorms, sticky, still nights with patches of dense fog add
up to the dog days of summer. The term comes from the ancient
Egyptians who thought the intense heat of this season was caused by
the extra warmth of another morning star. Sirius, the Dog Star of
the constellation Canis Major, is visible just before sunrise from
July 3 to Aug. 10. This period coincides with the highest average
temperatures for Egypt and much of the Northern Hemisphere.

   EZZARD-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Every week I get two or three calls

law requires ``no net loss of trees.'' That means when trees are
removed, they must be replaced by other trees that total the same
number of diameter inches. So if we've made progress with tree
protection ordinances, why the continuing outcry? It's simple:
People want to save old trees _ the native oaks, maples, hickories
and magnolias that set our city apart from others. But most tree
ordinances don't help with that. They allow ornamental trees to
replace the magnificent white oaks that have been around since the

 &HT;    Sunbuggy of the future
 &HT;    By Chuck McGinness
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Tom Sines boasts that his
custom-made electric car can turn on a dime, he's not exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down a narrow country road near his home in Okeechobee,
Sines slows the car to a near stop, then whips it around and heads
in the opposite direction with the flick of his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   To further prove his point that his car can out-maneuver any
other four-wheel vehicle on the road, he makes it spin in circles,
like a stomach-churning ride at the county fair.
</P>
<P>
   Sines' ``Sunbuggy'' looks a bit crude with its unpainted
fiberglass body and seats covered with carpet remnants, but it has
technology that may be the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a steering wheel, it has a joystick.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you drive a car, you have to do a certain amount of work
to steer. With this car, it's just like using the joystick on a
(Sony) Playstation,'' he said. ``It's just a lot easier to drive
and a lot more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Auto manufacturers have been experimenting with joysticks, or
electronic ``drive-by-wire'' controls for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Mercedes-Benz unveiled its F200 concept car, with
``sidesticks'' or joysticks in the interior door panels and center
console that the driver uses to steer, accelerate and brake. Cars
with a more open cockpit have proven to be safer in front-end
collision tests because there's no steering column or foot pedals
pushed toward the driver.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG spent $1.3 million to create a research
vehicle with twin sidesticks that look like they came out of an
airplane. The manufacturer says it will be several years before the
cost and regulatory problems can be worked out, and even then there
are concerns if consumers will be ready for such future-orientated
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the evolving world of non-polluting, alternative energy
vehicles, it seems like Sines has developed something that's quite
different, said Kara Flynn, spokeswoman for the Electric Vehicle
Association of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to say it hasn't been done elsewhere, but I've never heard
of it,'' said Flynn, whose Washington-based organization includes
vehicle manufacturers, electric companies, research institutions
and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sines, 59, actually started working on his vehicle as a hobby
about 25 years ago, after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 led to
increased gas prices and long lines at the pump. Rather than
complain about the situa The idea for the joystick started out as a
novelty, Sines said. The more he worked on it, the more he realized
how much easier it is to operate a car with a joystick, he said. He
has applied for a patent on his design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventing is a slow, meticulous, trial-and-error thing. You
try lots of things. Some work, some don't,'' he said. I think we
have something great here.''
</P>
<P>
   High gasoline prices and government regulations to increase fuel
economy and reduce emissions in new cars, trucks and SUVs have
sparked a renewed interest in electric vehicles and hybrid-electric
cars, said Flynn of the Electric Vehicle Association. Honda's
Insight and Toyota's Prius _ hybrid passenger vehicles that use
both gasoline and electric motors _ hit the U.S. market this year.
Ford plans to debut a hybrid electric version of its new small
sport utility vehicle, the Escape, in 2003. General Motors Corp.
will begin building a version of its Chevrolet/Silverado/GMC Sierra
pickups in 2004 that are powered by a gas-electric hybrid system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see a lot more of these alternative-energy vehicles on
the road in the next few years,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Sines would like to be part of the resurgence, but it depends on
finding investors to help set up a small manufacturing plant and to
market his car.
</P>
<P>
   He believes there are dozens, if not hundreds, of motorists in
South Florida who share his dislike for ``Big Oil'' and his love
for the environment and would want a Sunbuggy of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, this is such an exciting car,'' he said.
``It's just incredibly fun to drive.''

 &HT;    Numbers of pregnant teens dropping
 &HT;    By Mary McLachlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sixteen, pregnant, and she didn't want
to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Glenda Dowis' daughter couldn't foresee that her mother would
react violently, threaten her at gunpoint to get an abortion and
wind up in jail. The high school senior was simply following a
growing tendency among pregnant teenagers: going through with the
pregnancy rather than end it, despite parental disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who give birth also choose to keep their babies,
rather than place them for adoption as was the custom for previous
generations.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that started with the sexual revolution of the
1960s, faltered in the 1970s-80s under the novelty of legal
abortion and the self-involvement of the ``me generation,'' then
surged as single parenthood went from anomaly to norm in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the rate of teenage pregnancies is dropping, even as
more youths are becoming sexually active and at younger ages. Fewer
pregnancies mean fewer ``outcomes,'' as the statistics keepers call
births, abortions and miscarriages, and the numbers show abortion
on a steeper decline than the other outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, girls in Dowis' daughter's age group _ 15 to
17 _ became pregnant at the rate of 71.6 per 1,000 and had an
abortion rate of 30 per 1,000, according to the Alan Guttmacher
Institute, a reproductive study arm of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The last complete year of data for pregnancies and abortions was
1996, and by then the pregnancy rate was down to 61.5 per 1,000 and
the abortion rate was 19.
</P>
<P>
   Teen birth figures for 1998, the last available year, show the
rate had fallen 18 percent during the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the numbers dropped for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Fear of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread education about contraception, plus newer and more
reliable methods such as implants and injectable contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   More conservative attitudes, making casual sex less acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Abstinence and safe sex practices.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the declines, four of 10 American girls still become
pregnant at least once before they reach age 20, resulting in 1
million teen pregnancies a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Guttmacher Institute's figures show white and Hispanic teens
choose birth over abortion more often than their black
counterparts. Data from 1995 show 67 percent of white pregnant
teens gave birth to live babies, while 16 percent had abortions.
The remaining pregnancies ended in miscarriages or stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
   Among blacks, 49 percent gave birth, and 38 percent chose
abortion. For Hispanics, the figures were 66 percent births, 22
percent abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The number of teens who place their babies for adoption is hard
to determine, because money for studies is lacking and many women
choose to place their babies for adoption privately, according to
the National Council for Adoption.
</P>
<P>
   But the experience of the Children's Home Society of Florida
indicates a strong trend toward parenting rather than placing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of domestic adoptions of newborns has decreased
because it's so much more acceptable in society for teenagers and
single parents of any age to parent than before,'' said Amy
Garvin-Liddell, adoption supervisor for the society's local office.
</P>
<P>
   The office may work with 20 to 30 birth mothers a year, but have
only a fraction of them decide to put their children up for
adoption, Garvin-Liddell said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinics that provide abortion and contraception services say the
most disturbing element they encounter now is the increasing
numbers of barely pubescent girls engaging in sex. They show up
with their mothers or ``way older boyfriends,'' one clinic worker
said, because they're too young to drive and they have no money.

 &HT;    Salvors fight to keep precious treasure
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A Virginia federal appeals court ruling,
upholding Spain's legal ownership of a long-lost galleon sunk in
U.S. waters in 1750, has infuriated Florida's underwater salvors,
who fear the decision may deprive them of the thrill and profit of
one of the most exciting jobs imaginable: seeking sunken treasure.
</P>
<P>
   The decision involved the wreck of the Galga (''Greyhound,'' in
Spanish) off the Virginia coast. Diver Ben Benson of Sea Hunt Inc.
had located the Galga, along with another wreck, the 1802 Juno.
Armed with a state permit, Benson was exploring the Galga and
salvaging its cargo of gold and silver coins, when the government
of Spain stepped forward in 1998 and claimed both wrecks as its
property.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court ruled that the Juno belonged to Spain, but that
the Galga did not, because the 1763 Treaty of Paris ceded ``all
that Spain possesses on the continent of North America, to the East
or South East of the river Mississippi'' to Great Britain. Spain
appealed, saying the treaty applied to land, not warships. In late
July, a federal appeals court overturned the lower court decision
and ruled in Spain's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The decision could mark a sea-change in the legal status of
shipwrecks, precisely at the time underwater technology is making
them easier and easier to find.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is especially rich in wrecks of all periods, so many
that Florida State University offers a program in marine
archaeology. Sunken ships in thousands lie along the state's
1,200-mile-long coast, though few contain treasure, and the ones
that did have mostly been found and stripped of their precious
cargoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible that Spain made this claim,'' said Taffi
Fisher-Abt, who is the daughter of the late Mel Fisher, discoverer
of the fabulously rich wreck of the Nuestra Senora de Atocha in
1985. Fisher salvaged $400 million worth of gold, silver and
artifacts from the Atocha and waged a successful legal battle
against the state of Florida all the way to the Supreme Court, to
hold onto his treasure. His daughter today runs the Mel Fisher
Museum in Sebastian.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher died in 1998, but his company, managed by his son, Kim,
continues to search for sunken gold. The firm is currently
exploring a fleet of 12 Spanish vessels that sank in 1715 off Vero
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for us salvagers, there wouldn't be anything to
fight over. I don't see Spain putting up the money to search for
any ships anywhere, but when we find one, all of a sudden they get
interested,'' Fisher-Abt said.
</P>
<P>
   New finds emerged from the Atocha wreck only last month, and the
wreck's riches may be far from exhausted. Kim Fisher displayed
three solid gold bars, 120 silver coins, several gold chains, a
gold medallion that may be of Aztec origin, and other pieces of
Indian jewelry from South America. The latest finds may be worth as
much as $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher-Abt said she doubts the Virginia decision will affect her
family's rights to the Atocha and its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that, whatever happens, we would be
grandfathered in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia salvor Ben Benson, whose Sea Hunt firm got a permit to
search for the Galga in 1992 and located it in 1996 after sinking
$2 million into the search, could not be reached for comment.
Others welcomed the federal court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of happy doubloon-hunting have been running out for
some time now,'' said Florida state archaeologist Jim Miller.
``This is just one more stage in the never-ending saga of legal
complications about shipwrecks, but the court's decision
reestablishes a fundamental principle of law and sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Key West admiralty attorney Edward Horan disagreed. Horan's firm
successfully represented Mel Fisher in his fight to keep the Atocha
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just muddies the waters, if you will pardon a figure of
speech,'' Horan said. ``This case begs to be taken to the Supreme
Court, and I hope it will be. This decision completely changes the
way admiralty law has traditionally viewed an abandoned vessel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia court decision hinged on an obscure point of
admiralty law and the principle of ``abandonment.'' There are two
types of abandonment, implied and express.
</P>
<P>
   The law grants more leeway to salvaging commercial vessels,
because after a long period of time their abandonment is implied.
</P>
<P>
   But military vessels fall into a different category. To be fair
game for salvagers, the court ruled, a military vessel like the
Galga must have been expressly abandoned, by some formal act or
expression on the part of its owner. The Spanish government argued
in court that the Galga was a warship, that it had never been
expressly abandoned, and that it was therefore still Spanish
government property. The federal appeals court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Galga case pitted Benson and the state of Virginia not only
against the government of Spain, but those of the United States and
Great Britain as well. Both countries filed briefs supporting
Spain's claim to the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater technology is locating ships of all ages at fantastic
depths. The Titanic, the Lusitania, the Bismarck, the Britannic and
the U.S. aircraft carrier Yorktown have all been found within the
past few years. In 1999, Gus Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 Mercury
capsule was found and retrieved from the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean, where it had rested for 31 years at a depth of nearly 3
miles _ a mile deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. It only took
two weeks to locate the capsule on April 10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The salvors' position is simple: Finders keepers. Underwater
treasure-hunting is a gamble, risking both money and life. Fisher's
quest for the Atocha cost the lives of four people, including a
son, when a search vessel capsized in the middle of the night.
After he found the ancient hoard, worth $400 million, he gave one
artifact to Spain as a gift to Queen Sofia: a single cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Ben Benson fights it. I hope he appeals it all the way
to the Supreme Court. It's kind of a tragedy,'' Fisher-Abt said.
</P>
<P>
   Another treasure hunter, Peter Leo of Sebastian, responded to
the ruling with sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hell with the U.S. government, and the hell with Spain,''
said Leo, who has located the 1659 wreck of the San Miguel de
Archangel off Jupiter Inlet. ``Why don't we just give all the gold
back to the Indians of Bolivia, Peru and Colombia? It came out of
their homeland, after all. They're the ones the Spaniards stole it
from.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Leo has salvaged 10,000 silver coins, 30 gold coins, two
4-pound gold bars and one 80-pound silver bar. Under an agreement
with the state of Florida, 80 percent of the treasure belongs to
Leo's for-profit company, Jupiter Wreck Inc., and about 20 percent
belongs to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all the best stuff goes to the state. They get first pick
of the primo, pretty stuff, the nicest coins and so on. I'm not
complaining, though. We've got a good agreement, and I am hoping to
find the mother lode. If that happens, I can keep duplicates of the
coins we've already handed over to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo, who works full-time as a lifeguard and part-time as a
treasure hunter, discovered the wreck in 1987. He saw only vague
outlines in the sand to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no wood, just imprints. It was a shallow beach
wreck, buried under about 10 to 15 feet of sand. As the sand washed
away, I saw the remnants of cannons and anchors. Then as we blew
more of the sand away, we found more and more things.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions are highly variable around the wreck, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days, the water is gin-clear. Some days, you can't see
your finger in front of your mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo takes a cynical view of Spain's interest in its old wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical. If we were talking about clay pots, nobody would
be interested. But you put gold and silver out there, the rats come
out to guard the cheese,'' he said.

PROPS AND COSTUMES FROM YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES AND TV SHOWS ARE NOW
AVAILABLE ONLINE &HT;    (Note time element: Monday in 17th graf is Aug. 7)
 &HT;    By BRUCE WESTBROOK
 &HT;    c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine: Michelle Pfeiffer's dress in your closet, or Dr. Evil's
chariot in your garage.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen _ for a price _ thanks to a new army in the
Internet revolution: collectors of movie and TV memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Their rabid interest and avid bidding has sparked an explosion
of activity for (begin ital) objects de show biz (end ital) in
lively online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from costumes to cars is being sold, driven by the
cachet of having appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers aren't high-rollers who can pay $666,000 for Judy
Garland's ruby slippers from ``The Wizard of Oz,'' as occurred at
Christie's New York auction house last May.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, average fans are going online to buy memorabilia at
reasonable prices _ provided $160 for a film canister sounds
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   As this frenzy mushrooms, studios are taking notice. There's
gold in them thar prop warehouses, and MGM and others have begun
mining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, studios didn't try to recoup revenue from such
items,'' said Paul Brown, president of Legends in Time Memorabilia,
a Vancouver-based dealer in film artifacts (found at
www.webautographs.com).
</P>
<P>
   Studios stored some items after a production wrapped, while
others would be taken home by crew members, offered in small sales
on the lot, given to charity or discarded.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet is changing all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memorabilia is going through explosive growth thanks primarily
to the Internet,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, such items were sold largely by individuals on the
Web's top two auction sites: eBay (www.ebay.com) and Amazon
(www.amazon.com).
</P>
<P>
   But now studios are staging their own formalized auctions _
sometimes at their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're learning they have valuable assets in the prop room or
costume warehouse,'' Brown said. ``They're learning they can recoup
some production costs via online auctions rather than tossing this
stuff away.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line set the stage last year by creating its own auction
site at auction.newline.com. This marked the first time a major
film studio used the Internet to sell props and costumes to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Items from ``Lost in Space,'' ``Blast From the Past'' and the
``Austin Powers'' movies quickly sold. In fact, they're still
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Bids close at 6 p.m. Monday for Charlize Theron's robe from
``The Astronaut's Wife.'' On Sunday afternoon, the high bid was
$237.
</P>
<P>
   Items from ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' have been
pricier. Dr. Evil's chariot sold for $7,802, while a 1965 Corvette
with groovy decorations went for $121,000.
</P>
<P>
   MGM takes the plunge Friday, launching its biggest auction ever
with 600 items from ``The Outer Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the largest online auction ever devoted to a
single television series,'' claims Hank Cohen, president of MGM
Television Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding will be at Amazon Auctions (www.amazon.com/auctions).
For a preview, go to theouterlimitsprops.com.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdown: 400 props, 100 costumes, 50 drawings and 50 set
decorations. They're all from the sci-fi show airing on Showtime
and in syndication, not the '60s original.
</P>
<P>
   Bids will start at $1. There will be no reserves (a required
minimum bid) except for some costly items.
</P>
<P>
   The auction is timed to coincide with ``The Outer Limits' ''
two-hour series finale, ``Final Appeal,'' premiering on Showtime on
Sept. 3. It thus serves a dual purpose: raising money and
publicizing the show.
</P>
<P>
   Several items from the finale will be auctioned, including a
robe worn by Charlton Heston as a Supreme Court justice in the year
2070.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that robe to be much admired,'' said show publicist
Paul Gendreau.
</P>
<P>
   Which actors work with an item is a factor in its sale.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who's coordinating the ``Outer Limits'' auction, finds it
``staggering'' that people will pay so much for TV props.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a small `X-Files' auction of 38 items, and total
bidding was $53,000,'' Brown said. ``The top-selling item was a
piece of artwork wrapped around a book held by Gillian Anderson. It
was a piece of paper created on a computer, and it sold for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's astonishing,'' he said. ``I can't explain why people pay
such prices.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Outer Limits,'' Brown was determined to include
``things for the little guy who wants to spend $20. We like
everyone to have a chance.'' So even schematic drawings for props
will be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all this is just the tip of the junk heap. For its six
seasons, every ``Outer Limits'' drawing, blueprint, prop and
costume was saved, and up to 20,000 items are in a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   When the auction ends Sept. 5, they'll go on sale, too _ at the
preview site. Legends in Time will set prices on each item, ``and
the first person who pays gets it,'' Brown said. ``That sale should
last about two years.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM will get all proceeds, after fees are paid to Amazon and
Legends in Time and a donation is made to Variety Club Children's
Charity.
</P>
<P>
   MTV's ``Cool Crap'' auction is strictly philanthropic. Geared to
music-video props, it's running through Wednesday on Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work with the artists, who give us the stuff, and the money
generated benefits antiviolence charities as part of our `Fight for
Your Rights' campaign,'' said MTV spokesperson Carrie Caine.
</P>
<P>
   Some mementos mean big bucks. A green VW Beetle driven by Mandy
Moore in her ``Candy'' video was up to $43,000 Sunday. More
affordable are a pink microphone prop used in No Doubt's
``Ex-Girlfriend'' video (bidding was at $1,425 Sunday) and
``Daria'' animation cells ($310 as of Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Online auction giant eBay has become a home for organized prop
auctions, too. For 14 months eBay has hosted a massive sell-off
from another canceled TV show, Mystery Science Theater 3000.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Sci-Fi axed the series, its creators at
Minneapolis-based Best Brains began selling 10 years' worth of
memorabilia _ with amazing results.
</P>
<P>
   One fan spent $1,294 for a two-foot model of the show's
``Satellite of Love.'' But pieces of the ship's interior have sold
for as little as $20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sales have been $100 to $200,'' said Best Brains' Barbara
Tebben. That includes a film canister painted with the name Boggy
Creek II, which went for $160.
</P>
<P>
   Top-dollar item was the show's logo planet, which went for
$5,500.
</P>
<P>
   About 490 items have been sold, with another 60 being offered.
Best Brains' Jim Mallon, who directed many of the low-cost
episodes, said sales have surpassed $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate that this was a handmade show, and
now 500 of its props are scattered among our devotees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A trend is to auction movie items while the film is still in
theaters. DreamWorks is auctioning clothes, props and even vehicles
from its new What Lies Beneath at Amazon. A burgundy dress worn by
Michelle Pfeiffer _ and the partly burned candle she held in the
scene _ sold for $1,026 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Mallon worries that there could be a downside to the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave a thought to selling props as memorabilia while
we were making ('Mystery Science Theater 3000'),'' he said. Now he
fears that prop auctions will become a way to fund movies and
``we'll start seeing films with incredible amounts of (stuff) in
the background, just so they can turn around and sell it.''

 &HT;    Bush appeals to farmers and union members on last leg of Midwest
tourBy Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLIET, Ill. _ Gov. George W. Bush wound up his three-day
whistle stop train tour through the Midwest on Sunday, telling
crowds in steamy central Illinois that he is on the side of farmers
and union members as he worked to win over the state's key swing
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to hear us loud and clear. Even though the economy
is changing, there are certain things that are really important and
won't change,'' Bush said at a rally in Joliet, the first of three
Sunday. ``One of them is the ability to feed ourselves, feed our
family, feed our world. This is an administration that will never
forget the American farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   In shirtsleeves with wife, Laura, by his side, he looked into
the crowd and said: ``I appreciate the man down there carrying the
union sign. We welcome you to this camp. We know you're a
hard-working man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and running mate Dick Cheney rode the Victory 2000 Express
through Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan last week before winding up
their tour in Illinois. On Sunday, the train took them through the
corn and soy bean fields of central Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, the crowds were enthusasitc and large. In
Normal, 8,000 people came out to hear Bush and Cheney talk for
about 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush heads west for another train tour, this one
through California. He will travel with Arizona Sen. John McCain,
the man who delivered a blistering challenge during the primaries
and who is now working to help Bush win over wavering Democrats and
independents.
</P>
<P>
   Bush started off Sunday morning attending services at Sharon
United Methodist Church, a small, three-story church in Plainfield,
Ill. Cheney and his wife, Lynne, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert
and his wife, Jean, also attended. Afterward, Bush said he intended
to win Illinois, a state no Republican has carried since his father
won the state in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   A Chicago Tribune poll taken July 19-23 had Gore with 42 percent
and Bush with 40 percent. Released July 30, the poll of 900 likely
registered voters had a margin of error of three percentage points.
Nationally, the latest USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll had Bush at 54
percent and Gore at 37 percent. The poll of 653 likely voters was
taken Friday and Saturday and had a margin of error of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Across Illinois on Sunday, Bush told the sign-waving crowds
gathered in tiny towns that he wanted to share his ideas. On
Sunday, as he traveled to a rally in Normal, a woman in the tiny
town of Odell let him know loud and clear what she was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   As the train pulled into town, Bush caught sight of the woman
bent over, her pants pulled down and the phrase: ``Raise the Min
Wage'' scrawled across her buttocks. Bush favors raising the
mininum wage so long as states can opt out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' Bush said. ``You just got on national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right!'' the woman responded, as she pulled up her pants.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Bush turned to a cameraman filming the scene and said:
``Did you get her?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes, asked if reporters had
seen the woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we asked people to get behind Gov. Bush, that's not
exactly what we had in mind,'' she said.

SIGNS, SIGNS, EVERYWHERE STREET SIGNS (NAMES ENOUGH TO LOSE YOUR
MIND) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The map of one of the world's largest metropolises
is a kind of literary masterpiece. The street guide reads as if a
writer from the school of magical realism had translated the
encyclopedia, cut his work into confetti and sprinkled it over the
city.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a place where people live on streets with names like
88th and Third, as in Manhattan, or 35th and P, as in Washington.
This is a place where people live on Heart and on Soul. They live
on Forest of Light, Mirror of Water, Forest of Miracles, Garden of
Memories, Tree of Fire, Forest of Secrets, Sea of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Surreal street names can reflect hard realities. Work is long.
Love and Happiness are short. Good Luck crosses Hope, then hits a
dead end. Intersections become works of imagination: the Volga
River flows into the Nile, Beethoven meets Bach, the Himalayas
cross the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   And Comprehension ends in Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 million people lived here at the turn of the 20th
century; almost 20 million at the turn of the 21st. With the city
endlessly overflowing, the city fathers long ago ran out of dead
presidents, revolutionary heroes and military battles to use as
names for their streets, avenues and boulevards. One result, noted
in these pages before, is that the street guide has more than 100
listings of places named for Benito Juarez, father of his country.
There are also more than 200 named for Venustiano Carranza,
progenitor of Mexico's constitution, and nearly 300 for Lazaro
Cardenas, arguably its greatest president. Asked for directions,
citizens may react like the scarecrow in ``The Wizard of Oz'' when
Dorothy asked which way to the Emerald City, pointing in two
directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the sheer number of streets named the same that
overwhelms the senses, but the sheer magic in so many of the names
among the 70,000-odd streets. The city map makers have persevered
with an endurance perhaps more poetic than practical. But they must
be near their wits' end.
</P>
<P>
   They have exhausted the names of the world's great landmarks;
drained the lexicon of oceans and seas, rivers and lakes; paid
tribute to all the gods and goddesses, the birds and flowers, the
colors of the palette, the signs of the zodiac, the names of the
saints, the better-known stars and constellations.
</P>
<P>
   The major arts, crafts and sciences are taken and the minor ones
are going fast. Other capitals, conceivably, might also have a
boulevard dedicated to Bacteriology or Beekeeping. Mexico City also
has Cardiology Street and Astronomy Street, Orthodontist Street and
Hairdressers Street, Publicists Street and Biographers Street.
Significantly, the street dedicated to authors of fiction is not a
street, but Novelists Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Let Paris have its sidewalk semioticians. Mexico City may be the
only place in the world dedicated to a school of literary
criticism: Structural Analysis Street.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's calendar is full of holidays and dates of historical
significance. So is its capital: There are streets named for the
fifth day of January, February, March, May, June, July, September,
October, November and December. The fifth of May, the anniversary
of Mexico's victory in 1862 over French forces, has a special
place. Many, actually.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 streets with the name Cinco de Mayo are listed.
There are more than 100 streets named for days of the year, giving
a newcomer a nearly 1-in-3 chance of choosing an address matching
her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Like a sprawling sidewalk market, the streets are full of food.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Squid Street and a Shrimp Street and, for better or
worse, a Tuna Fish Street. There is Avocado Street, Onion Street
and Cilantro Street. Corn Street, Rice Street and Bean Street are
here, but, surprisingly, Mexico City has no Chicken Street
(although Kabul, Afghanistan, does). There are streets named
Fountain of Hope, Fountain of Light and Fountain of Happiness, of
course, but there is also the somewhat hallucinatory Fountain of
Mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of its place as a world city, the capital has christened
streets in the name of Greek Culture, Roman Culture, Mexican
Culture, Aztec Culture, Mayan Culture, Physical Culture and just
plain Culture, along with World Cinema Street, Mexican Cinema
Street and a generic Cinema Street. Social Action Street and Public
Assistance Street stand for civic virtues, although National Unity
Street dead-ends.
</P>
<P>
   Whole neighborhoods are dedicated to canonic writers and
composers, scientists and philosophers. One can stand on the corner
of Tolstoy and Dante, Dickens and Moliere, Verdi and Wagner,
Socrates and Homer, Shakespeare and Darwin, imagining the
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   There are many such serendipities. But in a place this big and
complicated, there are bound to be jarring collisions and
dissonances.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 streets named Peace, but 18 named High Tension
(after public utilities, not private miseries). Democracy, Justice
and Human Rights streets are in a tough neighborhood. Panama Canal
is barely 100 meters long, but 100 Meters Avenue runs nearly a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's respect for the past sometimes passes
understanding. Russia has liquidated the memory of its worst
dictators. But when Mexico City taxicab meters, which sometimes
malfunction, usually in the driver's favor, break down completely,
they are repaired on Stalin Street. Stalin lies a block away from
Leon Trotsky, though his henchmen assassinated Trotsky in Mexico
City some 60 years ago. By no coincidence, Siberia Street is four
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Some names have been clearly conceived. There is a Nafta Street,
in a neighborhood called Plentitude. Obscurity Street runs
hopefully into Tomorrow Avenue. Others seem intended to drive
mailmen mad. In one suburban neighborhood, there are two different
streets named for the same Islamic republic. One is Pakistan. The
other is Paquistan. Then there are the names in Nahuatl, the
language of the people who were here before the conquistadors,
which sound like music from another planet: Panquetzaliztli,
Cetlaltepetl, Ixtlememelixtle.
</P>
<P>
   But in cities as in science, mind-bending complexity can contain
beautiful simplicity. A great green park stands near the heart of
this urban beast. An avenue graced by Art Deco buildings circles
this park. And the people who live there have an unforgettable
address: Mexico Avenue, Mexico City, Mexico.

BIRTHRIGHT AN ISSUE IN ST. LOUIS FREE-FOR-ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo.)   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ William L. Clay, who created a stir more than 30
years ago when he became Missouri's first black congressman, is
creating another one by retiring, setting off a free-for-all for a
seat that hasn't been open since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Clay, the senior member of his state's congressional delegation,
is working feverishly to help his son, state Sen. William L. Clay
Jr., succeed him in Missouri's 1st Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger Clay, who is widely known by his middle name,
Lacy, is confronting a crowded field of competitors in this heavily
Democratic district, which includes the largely black north side of
St. Louis and large swath of St. Louis County, a predominantly
white suburban area.
</P>
<P>
   While there are five candidates in next Tuesday's Democratic
Party primary, the two considered the most serious _ and who are
spending the most money _ are Clay and Charlie Dooley, a member of
the St. Louis County Council, the governmental body in the area
just outside the city. Of the five, only Clay and Dooley hold
elective office.
</P>
<P>
   The race is being eagerly watched because it could affect how
Missouri's congressional districts are redrawn next year,
particularly as they relate to the adjacent district represented by
Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But it also being watched because it is a contest where race
provides a subtle but profound undercurrent, even though both major
contenders are black.
</P>
<P>
   Black residents make up slightly more than half of the district,
but about 60 percent of registered voters are white.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley has maintained that the Clay campaign is trying to
energize the black electorate against him by asserting that
Dooley's role as a county official makes him less concerned about
blacks in the city of St. Louis. At the same time, the Dooley
campaign has made nepotism an issue, asserting that while the
father has been a suitable congressman, the seat is not the
birthright of the son.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' Dooley said, ``there is a
racial dynamic here. Because I'm from the county and most of my
political allies are from the county and white, it's been portrayed
by the other camp that I'm not black enough. That's stupid talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay vehemently denies the accusation. ``I have never engaged in
racially divisive politics and I never will,'' he said. ``That's
not my style.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clay, who has been in the Missouri legislature for 17 years,
bristles at the suggestion of nepotism. ``No one is trying to
inherit anything,'' Clay said. ``I am going in front of the voters
like I have eight previous times. I am asking for their vote based
on my record and my accomplishments. I find that suggestion
insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clay name is well known in the St. Louis area, and the
congressman has worked hard to pass along much of his support and
campaign organization to his son, the younger Clay's election is by
no means assured.
</P>
<P>
   Clay's base is in the city of St. Louis, from the trim brick
homes along Fairground Park to the dilapidated storefronts along
the north side and the stylish restaurants and stores in the
Central West End. While the city of St. Louis once made up all of
the district, the area has been bruised by an exodus of people and
jobs. The decline in the population has pushed the district's
boundaries far into the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   That means Clay must work harder to get votes from an area where
Dooley has far greater influence.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been other problems for Clay in a race that has
grown increasingly acrimonious. For one thing, though his father
has long been known as a champion of organized labor, Clay has not
won the support of the state AFL-CIO. For the first time in recent
memory, the union declined to make an endorsement in the race,
saying instead that its affiliate labor organizations should make
their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the Dooley camp has accused Clay of a series of ethical
lapses. Most prominently, it has attacked Clay because he once
worked for a medical supply company operated by two brothers who
have been charged with Medicare and Medicaid fraud in Atlanta. And
Dooley's aides have charged that Clay failed to include his
relationship with the company on financial disclosure forms.
</P>
<P>
   Clay acknowledged that he worked for the company as a sales
representative, but ended his relationship with it two years ago.
He added that there had been no hint that the business had done
anything improper in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   And Clay has sued Dooley, charging that his campaign established
a special committee to illegally evade the limits on campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   While the candidates' character and fitness have emerged as
central themes, the two major candidates agree on virtually every
significant issue. Both want to use more federal money to hire new
teachers, and agree that health care should be more widely
available. They oppose the death penalty and support abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Their styles are hardly similar. The 52-year-old Dooley, a thin,
well dressed man who recently retired after 30 years with the
Boeing Corp. as a manager in the microfilm department, often
appears serious and earnest. Lacy Clay, 43, in contrast, is a
gregarious legislator who was seems as comfortable slapping the
backs of his fellow senators as dancing with school children at an
outdoor festival in his district.
</P>
<P>
   The contest could well have broader long-term implications on
Missouri's congressional districts. Since the cardinal rule of
redistricting is to protect incumbents, a victory by Clay would
likely put pressure of the legislature to preserve the district's
St. Louis neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But if Dooley wins, legislators will most likely shift the
district's boundaries farther into the suburbs of St. Louis County.
That would enable legislators to extend Gephardt's district north,
into the heavily black _ and securely Democratic _ terrain of St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates are working tirelessly, each
portraying himself as the front-runner. Many politicians suggest
that Dooley will benefit from a strong showing in the county and
from the support of many of its elected officials and some labor
groups.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Clay can expect strong support from other
union locals as well as by the endorsement of most elected
officials in St. Louis. And while Clay insists that the
congressional seat is not an inheritance, he shows no reluctance to
invoke his father's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father has been very involved in this race,'' Clay said.
``And I admire and revere my father. In politics, they say, you
inherit your father's friends and enemies. Fortunately, he has more
friends than enemies.''

 &HT;    Gladiolus grower keeps ``plugging away''
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When residents of the Winston Trails
development decorate their homes with fresh gladioluses from
Publix, they probably don't know the popular cut flowers once grew
where their homes now sit.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban site is just one of many parcels of land used over
the years by Mazzoni Farms Inc., which has grown gladioluses in
southern Palm Beach County for nearly six decades.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were dozens of gladiolus growers in the area in
the 1940s and 1950s, Mazzoni is the only one that has hung on as
the others dropped out. Today, Mazzoni Farms, is the only gladiolus
farm in Southeast Florida and one of a handful of growers in the
state, which is the nation's largest producer of the tall, flowered
stems.
</P>
<P>
   But President Bill Mazzoni, whose father started the business
here in 1941, said his day is coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a life expectancy now, too,'' said Mazzoni, 52, who
predicts he'll have to get out of the business, maybe in only five
years.
</P>
<P>
   It's a scenario facing farmers of all types in Palm Beach
County: Development pressures, coupled with threats from imports
produced with low-cost labor, are conspiring to push them out.
</P>
<P>
   For most local growers of other types of cut flowers, the
shakeout happened earlier, as imports from Colombia and Ecuador
began pouring into the United States in the mid-1980s. Lower labor
and regulatory costs meant foreign producers could pay to ship
flowers to the United States and still sell them for less, said
Bill Schall, a nursery extension agent for Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   As a gladiolus grower, Mazzoni was somewhat insulated because
the sheer weight of the long stems made them too expensive to
transport by air, eliminating South American growers as
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The business remained in good shape even as the North American
Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994, hammering Florida
vegetable growers with cheap imports from Mexico. That's because
Mexico did not produce gladioluses _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is just beginning to get into the business, Mazzoni said,
which means trucking across the border will become economically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be a serious nail in the coffin,'' he said. ``Once
they figure it out, they will be so cheap it won't pay to grow
flowers in the United States anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As development moves closer to fields and leasable land becomes
more scarce, ``the writing is on the wall,'' Mazzoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it has become more profitable to build homes on southern
Palm Beach County farmland than to grow vegetables or flowers, said
Bob Blankenship, an economic researcher for the Florida Department
of Agriculture. ``With that squeeze, and then with NAFTA coming
along, it speeds things up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, Mazzoni plugs away, planting about 25 million
bulbs a year on 900 acres he leases from rancher Billy Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   Planting season begins next month and runs through the middle of
March. Machines drop the bulbs, which are harvested from the
previous year's crop and stored at 38 degrees in the off-season.
Workers follow behind to space them and turn them upright.
</P>
<P>
   The mature stalks are harvested by hand also, between November
and June, with workers walking the rows day after day and cutting
only those spikes that are just about to open.
</P>
<P>
   Gladiolus bulbs have a three-year life, growing tall
asparagus-like spikes that love sun and temperatures in the 70s.
After that, new bulbs are used and fields typically are rotated to
help replenish nutrients. During the season, Mazzoni employs about
150 workers, mostly migrants, some of whom are housed in a camp
across from the company's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Mazzoni Farms employed more than 200 during the
season, but that also included people who worked for the company's
nursery business. Mazzoni said he left the foliage business in the
early 1990s, after losing millions because of plant damage from
DuPont Co.'s Benlate fungicide and watching volume chains such as
Wal-Mart push prices lower and lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep plugging along,'' Mazzoni said of his
gladiolus business. ``There is no intent to quit, but economics
will say when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   During the harvest season, Mazzoni ships 150,000 stems a day to
wholesale florists and grocery chains throughout the country.
Publix is his largest customer, though he will not disclose
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Florida growers received an average of 28.4 cents for each
gladiolus spike from wholesale buyers in 1999, according to data
from the Florida Department of Agriculture. Prices aren't much
higher on the retail end, with Publix supermarkets typically
selling a 10-spike bunch for $2.99.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 million bulbs in the ground, Mazzoni's goal is to sell
25 million spikes in a year. Each bulb typically produces one
spiked stem. Florida's two other major gladiolus growers are in the
Fort Myers, Bradenton and Palmetto areas.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoni, whose father died two years ago, still owns about 480
acres. Most of that he leases to other farmers, preferring to lease
Bowman's 900 contiguous acres for his own operation.

IT TAKES A WORLD WIDE WEB TO RAISE A VILLAGE
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Overlooked in last month's Group of 8 discussions about
the challenge of a growing ``digital divide'' between the
information rich and the data deprived was the work of Bernard
Krisher, a 69-year-old former journalist who is trying to bring the
Internet to one of the poorest regions in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Krisher's nonprofit group, American Assistance
for Cambodia, has been toiling to create a permanent Internet
connection to a primary school in the village of Robib, a cluster
of six rural communities in north central Cambodia, more than a
nine-hour drive from Phnom Penh. (On Monday, the group plans to
announce that it has succeeded.)
</P>
<P>
   The Internet link is being provided at no charge by Shin
Satellite in neighboring Thailand. By placing the village directly
on the Internet, Krisher, an American who worked as an Asia
correspondent for Newsweek for decades, says he hopes to assist in
the economic transformation of a region of Cambodia in which the
average per capita income is about $37 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing computer education and Web access to a
village school attended by 400 students, the Internet project is
supporting the creation of a small woven-silk industry in the
village, which plans to sell silk scarves and table runners on the
Internet. Once production begins, Krisher said, it might be
possible to generate as much as $2,000 a month in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to show that the Internet can really help a
single village,'' said Krisher, whose nonprofit group is based in
Tokyo, where he lives. ``If this is copied elsewhere around the
world, it might help eliminate the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the effort is on a small scale, Nicholas Negroponte, a
computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who
is also engaged in the effort to aid Cambodian villages, said the
project demonstrated that the global impact of the Internet could
ultimately serve to reverse the disparity between urban wealth and
rural poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Net will reverse urbanization,'' said Negroponte, director
of the MIT Media Laboratory. ``The past 150 years of development
have been one of urbanization. To be rural has meant to be poor.
The Net could bring some of the same opportunities to the rural
world and maybe even turn being rural into being rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-commerce effort has been created with the help of the
Hotel Okura, a luxury hotel in Tokyo that has agreed to process
credit card purchases made from the village's Web site, whose
server computer is in Phnom Penh (www.villageleap.com). The plan is
to ship the products by express mail through Cambodia's postal
service, with the intention of reaching customers anywhere on the
globe within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the Robib villagers are now being trained in the
once traditional weaving skills of the region _ skills that
atrophied under the brutal reign of the dictator Pol Pot in the
1970s and the years of strife afterward, isolating the country and
disrupting traditional trade patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A satellite dish provides a continuous 64,000-bits-a-second
connection to a small group of computers in the village, which are
powered for part of each day by a small solar power system. The
hookup is also being used for a simple experiment in telemedicine
that American Assistance has organized.
</P>
<P>
   A group of doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston
has agreed to answer health-related questions from villagers via
e-mail, as well as offer general guidance on diseases like malaria
and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we usually think about when we talk about
telemedicine, where a doctor may transmit an X-ray to a colleague
for a second opinion,'' Krisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge of Krisher's effort lies in helping
recreate the social structure of the village, which was disrupted
by the Khmer Rouge military under Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice, traditional Cambodian village,'' Krisher said.
``They had some old, dilapidated schools, and the Khmer Rouge
arrested all of the teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Krisher's commitment to Cambodia grew out of his years as a
foreign correspondent for Newsweek. While many of the magazines'
other reporters were drawn to Vietnam alone, Krisher traveled
widely in Asia during the 1960s and 1970s. He became close with the
Indonesian leadership and through those relationships was
introduced to Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two men initially had a mercurial relationship,
they ultimately became good friends, and Krisher kept in touch
while the prince was in exile when the Khmer Rouge were in power.
</P>
<P>
   When Sihanouk returned to Cambodia in 1990, he asked Krisher to
help the struggling country. In 1994, Krisher founded and became
publisher of The Cambodia Daily, a small English-language newspaper
in Phnom Penh. He also raised money for and helped found the
Sihanouk Hospital of Hope, in Phnom Pehn, which is now the nation's
largest hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Krisher set up American Assistance for Cambodia in 1990, running
it with his wife, Akiko, and his daughter, Deborah Krisher-Steele.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is to construct 200 rural schools in Cambodian
villages, under a program in which donors contribute $14,000 to
build small school houses, with matching funds from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Krisher said he thought the Internet added a powerful lever to
his small village-level projects. He said he received three or four
e-mail messages from children at the Robib school each day, asking
questions about his home in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Krisher said. ``You have to do things in a micro
way that doesn't require a vast amount of money. My basic
philosophy is to build a small sample and make it work and then
just copy that.''

 &HT;    Virtual high schools are now in sessionBy Sophia Lezin Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Telecommuting has made its way to the public schools _
at least in metro Atlanta's Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, students in 14 high schools can opt to take
one course per semester at home, on their personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   District educators have developed several online classes
_including Algebra I, Algebra II, Advanced Placement Language Arts
and Economics _ that will count toward graduation. The courses cost
$275 each.
</P>
<P>
   The state's largest school district is the first in Georgia to
offer online courses developed by its educators to all of its high
school students.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, students at about 20 Georgia high schools take online
classes through the Virtual High School project, a Concord,
Mass.-based program developed with a federal grant to offer
challenging Web-based courses.
</P>
<P>
   In Gwinnett, as many as 300 students are expected to enroll for
an online course for the fall semester, which begins Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Students log on to a designated Web site where lecture notes and
slide shows are posted. Homework and other assignments will be
submitted via e-mail, while Class Web sites have been set up to
allow teachers to see how much time students are spending on
assignments. Teachers may establish a chatroom where students'
questions are answered live. Tests will be password protected,
timed and accessible just once.
</P>
<P>
   Students will have only two mandatory face-to-face meeting with
their teacher _ for orientation and the final exam.
</P>
<P>
   Gwinnett developed its online program to give students,
especially those who work and are active in extra-curricular
activities, more flexibility, said Wendy Burns, an assistant
principal at South Gwinnett High who oversaw the development of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The county tested the program during the winter and summer
semesters.
</P>
<P>
   Helana Peterson, a rising sophomore, took Algebra I at home this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be really disciplined to do (the work) on your
own,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Her online instructor, Matthew Waymack, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one standing over their shoulder making them do
anything,'' he said. ``I'm not there. They have to be able to take
the initiative and ask if they have questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson finished the class with a B, but four of the 20
students who registered dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got behind and way over their head,'' Waymack said.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The map of one of the world's largest metropolises
is a kind of literary masterpiece. The street guide reads as if a
writer from the school of magical realism had translated the
encyclopedia, cut his work into confetti and sprinkled it over the
city.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a place where people live on streets with names like
88th and Third, as in Manhattan, or 35th and P, as in Washington.
This is a place where people live on Heart and on Soul. They live
on Forest of Light, Mirror of Water, Forest of Miracles, Garden of
Memories, Tree of Fire, Forest of Secrets, Sea of Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Surreal street names can reflect hard realities. Work is long.
Love and Happiness are short. Good Luck crosses Hope, then hits a
dead end. Intersections become works of imagination: the Volga
River flows into the Nile, Beethoven meets Bach, the Himalayas
cross the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   And Comprehension ends in Silence.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 million people lived here at the turn of the 20th
century; almost 20 million at the turn of the 21st. With the city
endlessly overflowing, the city fathers long ago ran out of dead
presidents, revolutionary heroes and military battles to use as
names for their streets, avenues and boulevards. One result, noted
in these pages before, is that the street guide has more than 100
listings of places named for Benito Juarez, father of his country.
There are also more than 200 named for Venustiano Carranza,
progenitor of Mexico's constitution, and nearly 300 for Lazaro
Cardenas, arguably its greatest president. Asked for directions,
citizens may react like the scarecrow in ``The Wizard of Oz'' when
Dorothy asked which way to the Emerald City, pointing in two
directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the sheer number of streets named the same that
overwhelms the senses, but the sheer magic in so many of the names
among the 70,000-odd streets. The city map makers have persevered
with an endurance perhaps more poetic than practical. But they must
be near their wits' end.
</P>
<P>
   They have exhausted the names of the world's great landmarks;
drained the lexicon of oceans and seas, rivers and lakes; paid
tribute to all the gods and goddesses, the birds and flowers, the
colors of the palette, the signs of the zodiac, the names of the
saints, the better-known stars and constellations.
</P>
<P>
   The major arts, crafts and sciences are taken and the minor ones
are going fast. Other capitals, conceivably, might also have a
boulevard dedicated to Bacteriology or Beekeeping. Mexico City also
has Cardiology Street and Astronomy Street, Orthodontist Street and
Hairdressers Street, Publicists Street and Biographers Street.
Significantly, the street dedicated to authors of fiction is not a
street, but Novelists Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Let Paris have its sidewalk semioticians. Mexico City may be the
only place in the world dedicated to a school of literary
criticism: Structural Analysis Street.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's calendar is full of holidays and dates of historical
significance. So is its capital: There are streets named for the
fifth day of January, February, March, May, June, July, September,
October, November and December. The fifth of May, the anniversary
of Mexico's victory in 1862 over French forces, has a special
place. Many, actually.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 streets with the name Cinco de Mayo are listed.
There are more than 100 streets named for days of the year, giving
a newcomer a nearly 1-in-3 chance of choosing an address matching
her birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Like a sprawling sidewalk market, the streets are full of food.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Squid Street and a Shrimp Street and, for better or
worse, a Tuna Fish Street. There is Avocado Street, Onion Street
and Cilantro Street. Corn Street, Rice Street and Bean Street are
here, but, surprisingly, Mexico City has no Chicken Street
(although Kabul, Afghanistan, does). There are streets named
Fountain of Hope, Fountain of Light and Fountain of Happiness, of
course, but there is also the somewhat hallucinatory Fountain of
Mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of its place as a world city, the capital has christened
streets in the name of Greek Culture, Roman Culture, Mexican
Culture, Aztec Culture, Mayan Culture, Physical Culture and just
plain Culture, along with World Cinema Street, Mexican Cinema
Street and a generic Cinema Street. Social Action Street and Public
Assistance Street stand for civic virtues, although National Unity
Street dead-ends.
</P>
<P>
   Whole neighborhoods are dedicated to canonic writers and
composers, scientists and philosophers. One can stand on the corner
of Tolstoy and Dante, Dickens and Moliere, Verdi and Wagner,
Socrates and Homer, Shakespeare and Darwin, imagining the
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   There are many such serendipities. But in a place this big and
complicated, there are bound to be jarring collisions and
dissonances.
</P>
<P>
   There are 21 streets named Peace, but 18 named High Tension
(after public utilities, not private miseries). Democracy, Justice
and Human Rights streets are in a tough neighborhood. Panama Canal
is barely 100 meters long, but 100 Meters Avenue runs nearly a
mile.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's respect for the past sometimes passes
understanding. Russia has liquidated the memory of its worst
dictators. But when Mexico City taxicab meters, which sometimes
malfunction, usually in the driver's favor, break down completely,
they are repaired on Stalin Street. Stalin lies a block away from
Leon Trotsky, though his henchmen assassinated Trotsky in Mexico
City some 60 years ago. By no coincidence, Siberia Street is four
blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Some names have been clearly conceived. There is a Nafta Street,
in a neighborhood called Plentitude. Obscurity Street runs
hopefully into Tomorrow Avenue. Others seem intended to drive
mailmen mad. In one suburban neighborhood, there are two different
streets named for the same Islamic republic. One is Pakistan. The
other is Paquistan. Then there are the names in Nahuatl, the
language of the people who were here before the conquistadors,
which sound like music from another planet: Panquetzaliztli,
Cetlaltepetl, Ixtlememelixtle.
</P>
<P>
   But in cities as in science, mind-bending complexity can contain
beautiful simplicity. A great green park stands near the heart of
this urban beast. An avenue graced by Art Deco buildings circles
this park. And the people who live there have an unforgettable
address: Mexico Avenue, Mexico City, Mexico.

December to start his own Web site, heads turned both inside and
outside the newsroom. After all, Dixon had become the newspaper's
franchise columnist _ the lead writer and editor of the
much-heralded Lex column. Each day, he provided smart commentary on
the merger of the day or a company's recent earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a byline, the columnist was so well known in the
world of London finance that his departure from The Financial Times
was chronicled in most of the big national newspapers. Gossipy
items about his exit peppered the papers with almost the same
attention showered on the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   But that attention turned to real rubbernecking in May, when
Dixon announced that he had effectively defected to The Financial
Times' rival, The Wall Street Journal. Dixon, 36, signed a deal to
begin publishing a daily column in September that mimics The Lex _
based on content from his new Web site, BreakingViews.com _ in The
Wall Street Journal's European edition. In addition, Dow Jones, the
Journal's parent company, took a 7 percent stake in
BreakingViews.com, which offers quick financial commentary online
about breaking-news subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's move came as The Wall Street Journal and The Financial
Times, a unit of Pearson PLC, are in an intensifying brawl aimed at
increasing readership on each other's home turf. And the focus on
Dixon has recently become more intense because of an accusation
being privately levied by some of his former colleagues: Dixon may
have a conflict of interest because his company is being partly
financed by people and companies that he and his team of
journalists are supposed to be writing commentary about.
</P>
<P>
   In a city that is not known for objective journalism, and at a
time when media companies increasingly are financially intertwined
with the people and companies they write about, it is not clear if
the accusation is fair. Dixon acknowledges that the company's
investors include Morgan Stanley Dean Witter along with his
longtime friend, Roland Rudd, who owns Finsbury, one of the leading
financial public relations firms in London representing leading
European companies, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Dixon rebuts the criticism as simply noise. ``I myself think
it's an issue that's been blown up to be an issue, but I don't
believe it's an issue,'' he said. ``I don't know who has a 3
percent stake in New York Times or Dow Jones or in Pearson or
whatever, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was an investment
bank that did. Everyone owns stakes.'' He also said that the stakes
are ``passive'' and that neither financial backer has a seat on his
board.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Dixon has been in the limelight since he left The
Financial Times just before Christmas, taking his colleague from
the Lex column and partner, Jonathan Ford, with him to help him
start BreakingViews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon says he conceived the idea for a financial-commentary Web
site more than four years ago, just after interviewing Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, during a dinner with Michael Kinsley, who had
just started Slate, a political and culture Web magazine owned by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't clear to me whether it made sense to put a political
magazine online,'' he recalls thinking. ``But in the financial
arena, where investors are trading stocks'' on a day of news
developments, he said, ``speed is essential. So it seemed to me
that financial journalism was naturally suited to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, though, in 1996, the Internet had yet to emerge in
Europe with the same force as in the United States. It was not
until last year, ``with sites like TheStreet.com going public and
money so available for ideas like this,'' he said, that he began to
consider the idea seriously. Having raised about $1 million in a
first round of financing by December, Dixon and Ford turned in
their resignations at The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To leave an established organization is quite a wrench,'' he
said. ``They would try to give me all these goodies, and I was
saying no with increasingly strange excuses about why I was turning
down these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombshell came when he told his ex-employer that he planned
to start a Web site that would effectively be an online version of
Lex, the paper's franchise column. In what may have seemed like a
further affront to The Financial Times, he went on to be named the
British business journalist of the year for his work at the
newspaper, and he audaciously promoted BreakingViews.com at the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early in May, he announced that he had raised $6.7 million
and made his syndication deal with The Wall Street Journal Europe.
The timing could not have been more important in the bruising
battle between the two business broadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal redesigned its European edition in
February to better suit readers and has been aggressively marketing
the paper across the Continent. At the same time, The Financial
Times has tried to make inroads in the United States with a $35
million advertising campaign starring Dan Aykroyd plugging its Web
site, FT.com.
</P>
<P>
   Financial Times reporters and editors have been privately
griping about Dixon's defection and his investment partners, though
none agreed to do so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Top executives at the paper were terse. Richard Lambert, the
editor in chief, said simply, ``I don't have an opinion about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for The Wall Street Journal, Richard J. Tofel, the Dow Jones
vice president for corporate communications, said the company is
committed to BreakingViews.com. ``In terms of financial firms
having stakes in publishers, that's nothing new,'' he said. He
pointed out that Dow Jones has a business relationship with General
Electric through CNBC and also has business interests or alliances
with Reuters and Hearst. ``Whether things are adequately disclosed
is what's important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dixon, the Web site and the column in The Wall
Street Journal Europe will include a disclaimer if he or his staff
ever write directly about any of his investors. He said there was
no reason to put a disclaimer on articles, for example, about
clients of Morgan Stanley ``because they advise on zillions of
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times operates a joint newsroom with and has an
investment stake in TheStreet.com, an online financial news and
commentary site that may compete with BreakingViews.com. The
Street.com is partly owned by James J. Cramer, the hedge fund
manager and columnist. It has policies to deal with the appearance
of conflicts, and Cramer's columns carry disclaimers when he writes
about stocks he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, the reporting in BreakingViews.com does
not so far seem to have been colored by its investors' interests.
The site carried a critical column about Carlton Communications,
one of Finsbury's largest clients, which was noted in an item in
The Observer last Sunday. And when Dixon wrote a column this week
about Pearson's acquisition of National Computer Systems, it
included a disclaimer noting that Dixon had worked for the
Financial Times and that he also owned shares in Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Dixon is used to being in public view, his
financial arrangements may expose him to a new level of scrutiny.
He does not shy away from the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people from the FT coming to our site,''
Dixon said, grinning.

GLYNN STRIKES A CHORD

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
TORONTO _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates has been almost begging his
young starters to throw more strikes. Ryan Glynn heard the
manager's plea and took the advice to heart.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glynn survived a three-run homer by Dave Martinez in the first
inning and pitched the Rangers to an 11-6 victory against the
Toronto Blue Jays at SkyDome yesterday. After Martinez went deep,
Glynn retired 20 of the next 24 batters he faced, giving his
teammates a chance to go to work on the Blue Jays' pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had real good stuff today,'' Glynn said. ``I felt strong.
That's not exactly the way you want to start. After losing the
first three games here, I wanted to give my team a chance to win. I
knew the guys didn't want to get swept.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn's effort and 16 hits from his teammates, including three
doubles by Mike Lamb, allowed the Rangers to avoid a four-game
sweep at the hands of the Blue Jays. In the clubhouse afterward,
the manager rejoiced, not about avoiding the sweep but by the sight
of one of his young pitchers going after hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him so, too,'' Oates said. ``Maybe it will set the tone
for everybody else. It can be done. He did it extremely well. Down
3-0 before you crack a sweat, pitching the way he did, that was a
veteran performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates also praised the work of backup catcher B.J. Waszgis, who
made his first major-league start. Waszgis had two hits, and Oates
said he worked well with Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very composed,'' Oates said. ``When I went to the mound, he
knew exactly what he wanted to do. Glynn and Waszgis did a super
job working together. They came right after hitters, saying: `Here
it is. Hit it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Glynn: ``What I worried about last year was about throwing
strikes and not walking hitters. What I'm doing now is just make
the hitters hit the ball. My defense is doing a great job. When I
get into trouble is when I start trying to strike people out. I get
overaggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn said that's what happened in the seventh after he struck
out Craig Grebeck for the second out. The Rangers were leading 7-4,
but Shannon Stewart and Alex Gonzalez both singled and Glynn walked
Martinez to load the bases, bringing up Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put my team in a position where it could lose the game,''
Glynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Venafro bailed Glynn out, getting Delgado to swing at a
first-pitch fastball and ground out to second base to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's hit that pitch out of the ballpark 10 times this
year,'' Venafro said. ``He just got on top of it this time.''
</P>
<P>
   With Glynn keeping the Blue Jays at bay, the offense was able to
come back against Blue Jays starter Kelvim Escobar and three
relievers. They erased the early damage with three runs in the
third on Ricky Ledee's two-out, run-scoring single and a two-run
double by Scott Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went ahead for good in the fifth on a run-scoring
single by Rusty Greer. Rafael Palmeiro followed that with a double
into the right-field corner that made it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon, giving Royce Clayton a day off at shortstop, continues
to show his value as a utility player. He went 2-for-5, with a
run-scoring single in the ninth inning and is now hitting .295.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot of work and a lot of preparation,'' Sheldon
said. ``I try not to do much when I get in there. The tendency is
to try and impress or do something really good. I just try to swing
at good pitches and put a good swing on the ball.'' nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the changeover to digital television was
starting, government leaders and industry executives described the
transition as one of those rare touchstone events that would, in
time, change the lives of every American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be different,'' Reed E. Hundt said in 1996
when, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, he was
about to approve the rules that set the transition in motion. ``The
change is so extreme that many people have not grasped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many Americans still have not grasped digital
television. Four years after Hundt spoke and two years after the
first digital television sets went on sale, few Americans even know
the change is under way. And the transition is so mired in
intractable problems, squabbles and controversies that some
industry executives now worry that the current plan for the digital
rollout could fail.
</P>
<P>
   How long will the broadcasters be willing to spend money
transmitting digital signals if there are no viewers? How long will
the government allow television stations to tie up two channels _
one analog, the other digital _ at a cost of many billions of
dollars? The government is eager to auction off the analog
channels, and is already counting the auction proceeds _ billions
of dollars _ in future budget projections.
</P>
<P>
   Although the questions have no answers at present, a consensus
is emerging that the current approach is not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition as a whole is faltering,'' Ben Tucker, chairman
of the National Association of Broadcasters' television board, said
in a recent letter to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Government initiatives to jump start the transition have been
either absent or ineffectual. William E. Kennard, chairman of the
the FCC, occasionally inveighs against the delays, threatening to
pass rules that could clear some logjams. But the commission's
rule-making procedures allow such long periods for public comment
and internal discussion that they can drag on for months or years.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, meanwhile, has shown little interest in this subject
of late _ despite one inconclusive public hearing on July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal rules that were set when the transition began,
the nation's television broadcasters were each given a digital
channel to use alongside their existing analog channels during the
transition period. In 2006, all of the nation's 1,600 analog
television channels are to be shut down and be auctioned off to the
highest bidder; auction winners will use the space on the airwaves
for wireless communications services or other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   When that day comes, broadcasters will have only their digital
channels, and only people with new digital television sets, or
converter boxes, will be able to watch over-the-air television.
</P>
<P>
   The date can be pushed back, of course. But when the government
set that deadline three years ago, officials vowed with certainty
that by now the transition would be well under way because digital
television would offer so many compelling programs and so many
dazzling new digital services that consumers would line up to buy
the new sets.
</P>
<P>
   Or so the thinking went.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two years of aggressive marketing by consumer
electronics companies, only about 230,000 digital television
monitors have been sold in the United States, even though they now
sell for as little as $2,500, compared with $6,000 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Electronics Association argues that those numbers
are impressive for a new product. But the association's figures
also show that only about 40,000 of those buyers have also bought
the new digital receivers that are needed to watch the new
programming, and the latest figures show that sales of those
receivers have actually fallen sharply in recent months. In the
digital world, the television display and the receiver are usually
sold separately, and the least expensive of the receivers now sells
for about $600.
</P>
<P>
   Those sales figures are minuscule compared with about 260
million television sets nationwide that will have to be replaced,
or updated with a converter box, by 2006. Price is an obvious
problem dampening sales; a comparable big-screen analog television
costs $1,500 or less. But the largest reason seems to be that
there's almost nothing new to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The most compelling feature of digital television to many
industry executives is its ability to broadcast high-definition
pictures so sharp and clear that they look almost real. But even
with about 150 digital television stations broadcasting in 52
cities nationwide, there is little true HDTV on the air. During
nearly all of the broadcast day on most of the channels, the
stations are simply showing digital copies of their regular fare,
giving viewers little incentive to make the change.
</P>
<P>
   The few hours of HDTV that are being shown _ and at that, CBS is
the leader, with offerings like sports, movies and prime-time shows
_ are in large part being paid for by television manufacturers or
other companies that, network executives contend, have more to gain
from the success of the format. The networks seem little interested
in HDTV if it costs them any significant money.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-definition television is absolutely stalled; there's no
broadcaster interest,'' Ed Grebow, president of Sony's broadcast
and professional company, said in a recent article in the journal
Electronic Media. Grebow, whose unit at Sony sells high-definition
cameras and other equipment, declined requests for further comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sony's television division recently canceled
its line of high-definition television sets that were scheduled to
go on sale in the fall. The company now plans to delay the
introduction until at least next year because of uncertainty about
the transition and the many problems besetting it.
</P>
<P>
   Production problems also played a role. But ``there's too much
political jockeying and positioning going on behind high
definition,'' said Victor J. Pacor, head of Sony's television
division. ``And we're not comfortable building sets based on what
we think will occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Konka, a Chinese company hoping to enter the American market
with a new line of high-definition sets, also announced a delay
last month, for the same reasons.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, several hundred of the nation's television stations
have made deals to lease part of their digital channel for other
uses _ principally to send audio-video streaming media to personal
computers equipped with digital over-the-air receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives oppose these side deals; they fear that if
part of the channel is put to other uses, there will not be enough
space left for high-definition programming, which can easily fill
the entire channel. They also complain that digital television was
supposed to bring exciting new services to TVs _ not PCs.
</P>
<P>
   At the congressional hearing late last month, Rep. Billy Tauzin,
R-La., chastised some station owners who were planning to lease out
their spectrum, saying: ``That was clearly not in the deal. If
broadcasters did that, I think you'd run the risk of Congress
revisiting the deal and reclaiming the spectrum. It would be a
clear deal breaker not to show Americans HDTV.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest and most disruptive controversy is a growing
debate over the adequacy of the transmission format for
broadcasting digital signals. Tests over the last year have
indicated that television sets with indoor antennas generally
cannot receive a reliable digital picture.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the FCC rejected a request from several hundred
television stations to revise the format, and equipment makers have
promised to make the current system work better. But since then,
the chorus of discontent has grown, and the critics now include ABC
and NBC. Even the Advanced Television Systems Committee, an
industry group that controls the format's technical standard and
has been its most aggressive defender, recently said it had started
an initiative to improve or revise it.
</P>
<P>
   That caused anxiety at Sony and other companies, where
executives worry that they may be building digital television
receivers that might not work with a revised standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have to go back to the drawing board, and it would
probably be four years before we could get new product out,'' said
Dave Arland, a spokesman for Thomson Consumer Electronics, which
sells more televisions in this country than any other company, most
under the RCA brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would kill the transition,'' Arland added. ``I'm
not even sure we would make the investment, frankly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And there is yet another problem. About two-thirds of the
nation's television viewers subscribe to cable, but most cable
companies refuse to carry the broadcasters' new digital shows.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years ago, the FCC opened a proceeding to
determine whether the ``must carry'' rule that requires cable
systems to carry local analog broadcasts would also apply to the
digital world. The commission still has not made a decision and has
set no date for doing so. But even if the FCC were to decide to
require cable companies to carry broadcasters' digital shows
starting tomorrow, most cable subscribers who own digital
television sets still could not see the new programming. That is
because industry negotiators have been trying for more than two
years to agree on a way to connect a digital set to a digital cable
box.
</P>
<P>
   They still have not agreed, caught in a seemingly endless debate
between the set makers and Hollywood studios over copy-protection
techniques for digital shows. The studios fear that digital copies
of their recent movies appearing on cable will be seized by pirates
and copied endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from the FCC, the industries did seem to agree on
one issue last month: how to label future digital televisions that
are cable ready. Because there will be two types of cable-ready
sets _ those that can receive digital programming and others that
are also capable of supporting interactive programming _ two
different names were needed. After months of discussion, the
television manufacturers and cable companies proudly announced that
they had agreed on two names: Digital TV-Cable Connect and Digital
TV-Cable Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The names do not roll off the tongue easily _ one reason that
Circuit City and other large television retailers immediately
objected. The Consumer Electronics Association quickly backed away
from the agreement, saying their members were not obliged to adopt
the new names, even though the cable industry contended that the
agreement had been binding.
</P>
<P>
   And, like so much else in this blighted transition, no one knows
if or when that debate might be resolved.

MORE CONFLICT EXPECTED AT REFORM PARTY'S CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Months of bickering and conflict are expected to reach a
crescendo of sorts this week, when the Reform Party gathers to
nominate a presidential candidate at its national convention in
Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the tame and carefully planned Republican convention that
anointed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas on Thursday, the four-day
meeting of Reform Party members promises some sharp skirmishes as
the delegates choose between Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin for the
party's presidential nomination and the $12.6 million in federal
campaign funds that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   The party has moved into such contentious terrain that Ross
Perot, the party founder and two-time presidential candidate, has
had virtually nothing to do with it in the last few years. So far
as anyone can tell, he has made no plans to attend the convention.
Nor has Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the only Reform Party
member ever elected to such high office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war over the direction of the Reform Party,'' said
Russell J. Verney, the party's former chairman and a leading force
against Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders on both sides of a dispute over Buchanan's candidacy
agree that what happens in Long Beach will go a long way toward
defining the party's future _ either one based on governmental
reform as envisioned by Perot or, if Buchanan wins the nomination,
one based on the conservative positions he has championed for
years, like opposition to abortion, affirmative action, illegal
immigration and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   That Buchanan has made his fight against those issues the
hallmark of his presidential campaign represents the major source
of conflict within the party.
</P>
<P>
   While Perot's brand of Reform Party was always silent on those
issues because they were divisive and exclusionary, Buchanan has
brought them to the fore, as he did again Sunday on a round of
morning talk shows, offering further evidence to his opponents that
he intends to transform the party into a haven for social
conservatives and disaffected right-wing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the Republican Party for excluding conservatives at
its nominating convention last week, Buchanan said on CBS' ``Face
the Nation'' that ``there wasn't a single voice up there for the
unborn, there was nobody that got up and spoke about right to
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and a major speaker at the Republican convention,
Buchanan said on ABC's ``This Week'': ``Affirmative action, quotas,
racial preferences are wrong. They're unjust discrimination against
white folks because of the color of their skin or where their
ancestors came from, and I don't care if General Powell gets up and
says they're right. For heaven's sakes, why did not a single
Republican get up and say `That is wrong'?''
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime as a Republican, Buchanan joined the Reform
Party last year and set off to re-energize it by recruiting voters
and party organizers. It worked. But the stronger his forces
became, the more he worried longtime party members, especially
Perot supporters, who feared their founding principles would be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on several programs Sunday, Buchanan accused them of
trying to destroy the party by blocking his efforts and ``simply
mixing the Kool Aid for the party,'' as he said on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The feuding factions will not even wait until the official start
of the convention, on Thursday, to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it all starts Tuesday morning, when the party's
national committee _ three people from every state and the District
of Columbia, plus the 11 members of the executive committee _ meets
to consider challenges over who has the right to serve on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Buchanan campaign, which called for the meeting, has
challenged as many as 30 people, the seating of whom would have a
huge bearing on who wins the nomination. By party rules, the
Buchanan supporters need a two-thirds majority on the national
committee _ they say they need just a simple majority _ to settle a
dispute over who is chairman of the convention credentials
committee.
</P>
<P>
   That is important because if the Buchanan forces prevail, their
man, Frank Reid, the Ohio state chairman, would oversee the
convention credential process and play a persuasive role in
settling more than 40 delegate challenges, which affects the
seating of hundreds of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   By party rules, a candidate can ask that the primary vote, which
began last month and concludes this week, be set aside so that the
delegates, by a two-thirds vote, can choose the party nominee.
</P>
<P>
   By controlling the delegates, Buchanan would not have to worry
about the possibility that Hagelin, a quantum physicist who has run
for president twice before on the Natural Law Party ticket but has
uncertain support within the Reform Party, would win the popular
vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The national committee is also scheduled to resolve another key
issue: whether a recent vote by the executive committee to
disqualify Buchanan from the primary should stand.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin has accused the Buchanan campaign of corrupting the
primary process by submitting the names of ineligible voters to be
sent ballots. A panel was appointed to review the charge, and it
asked both campaigns to provide material that proved the legitimacy
of the names they submitted.
</P>
<P>
   After Buchanan's campaign refused, the panel recommended that he
be disqualified, a decision that the executive committee supported
by vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan forces assert that the executive committee vote was
improper, sending the dispute before the national committee.
</P>
<P>
   For all the tension and conflict, Buchanan seems not to be
affected in the least. He has boldly predicted that he will win the
nomination, saying Sunday on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``I think you
will see at Long Beach the fact that this is a Buchanan party, a
conservative party, reform party and populist party, and you will
be surprised at the unanimity.''
</P>
<P>
   One who certainly will be surprised if there is unanimity is
Hagelin. He said last week that if Buchanan won the nomination by
any spurious means, he would sue him.

GIVING ONLINE AUDIENCES NEWS THEY WANT 
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is how Jonathan Klein, a former high-level executive at
CBS, sees the future of news:
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will click on video reports they want to see, when they
want to see them. Computerized news services will learn users'
viewing habits and offer them news bits tailored to their tastes.
Advertisers will aim at viewers based on their supposed news
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Klein is so sure that his vision of the future is accurate that
he is staking $35 million in venture capital on a new Web site,
FeedRoom, which is to make its public debut later this month.
</P>
<P>
   FeedRoom is one of a handful of new Web sites offering users
television-style news reports on the Internet, in digestible bits
that can be put together into personalized newscasts. Yahoo has a
similar offering, as does Zatso.com, a new company from San
Francisco. Another site, called Jagfn.com, posts video reports
about financial news.
</P>
<P>
   These services are based on the new-media assumptions that
consumers want information and entertainment on demand and that
high-speed Internet connections, offered by broadband services, can
finally give it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to watch good news, you'll watch good news; if you
like to watch crime news, you'll watch crime news,'' said Klein,
who was executive vice president of CBS News from 1995 to 1998.
``It's putting the clicker in the viewer's hand and saying, `You
decide.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the not too distant future, Klein predicts, this new
style of newscast will replace the traditional news fare of the
major networks and local TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that prediction is an accurate one and whether it would
be a step forward or back for journalism are matters of heavy
debate in the television news industry, which is struggling to hang
on to viewers amid increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   And even if Klein is right, analysts say, it is not clear that
sites like his would be well received by people not yet accustomed
to watching anything resembling TV on computers that, for the most
part, have poor pictures and make for uncomfortable viewing.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Klein's news service is among the most ambitious
attempts yet to recreate a television news experience on the
Internet. Though the concept has been around for a while, it has
been slow to take off because of inadequacies in Internet
technology.
</P>
<P>
   And the more established news providers have been hesitant. They
are waiting to see which business models will survive and how
viewing habits will develop, once more people have broadband, or
high-speed, Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   FeedRoom, which will require users to have broadband
connections, is meant to be user friendly, with a central video
window occupying one-quarter of the computer screen (currently,
video windows occupy only about one-sixteenth). The main window is
flanked by smaller ones advertising the available reports. A
separate box offers viewers links to different types of reports
under categories like health, entertainment, finance and sports.
</P>
<P>
   The reports will be provided by local stations around the
country that have struck deals to provide video to FeedRoom, which
in return will share advertising revenue and design the stations'
individual Web pages. Last week, Klein announced two such
agreements with the NBC television station group and Tribune
Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   What stops these major media companies from doing it themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a very large, successful broadcast business that
we have to continue to run and grow,'' said Jay Ireland, president
of the NBC station group. ``These guys had a combination that
proved very valuable, and it gets us out there quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   With the NBC and Tribune deals in place, FeedRoom now has ties
to 32 TV stations that reach 45 percent of the country's television
markets. Klein said he hoped to complete similar deals with other
big television networks by the end of the year. Although no major
advertiser is signed yet, he said he had enough financing _ from
investors like Warburg Pincus, Ridgewood Capital and Intel _ to
operate for two years without ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But FeedRoom is designed with advertisers well in mind, and
Klein said he expected to close some deals soon. The site is
equipped with software that can identify users and, based on what
segments they tend to select, aim specific banner ads at them. The
system is also programmed to give on-screen prominence to the types
of segments an individual viewer tends to choose.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic winnowing is worrisome to many journalists and
media experts, who fear that the proliferation of personalized news
will enable viewers to filter out information that is important but
may not be sizzling entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business model might do a very good job of supporting
narrow content for things like sports or business or health,'' said
John V. Pavlik, executive director of Columbia University's Center
for New Media. ``But I'm not so confident that the business model
will support public affairs journalism. Who, exactly, is going to
be the sponsor for that type of news?''
</P>
<P>
   Some network news executives said last week that they shared
that concern, especially in light of the low TV ratings for last
week's Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has potentially enormous implications for not only how we
do our business, but also for our democracy,'' said Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``it has implications for the citizenry that might be
disturbing, that doesn't mean you can stop it,'' he added. ``This
is where the technology is heading.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, big-network news executives like Heyward seem satisfied
to sit back and monitor expensive experiments like Klein's. ``The
FeedRoom is one of what are going to be numerous experiments in the
early days of broadband,'' Heyward said. ``No one knows which is
going to prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have little research on which to base forecasts because
of the embryonic state of broadband Internet access _ whose 31
million users so far are mostly office workers and college
students, according FeedRoom's research.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not stop analysts from debating whether computer
users are ready for personalized, TV-style, online newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to do broadband video right now,'' said David
Card, a media analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``Point one:
There aren't a lot of people who have broadband. Point two: Even in
broadband, it's not a beautiful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledged the challenges. ``It's an enormous risk,'' he
said. ``But the rewards are enormous if this thing works.''

HOLYFIELD DOESN'T GET IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield is losing his grip on reality.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he actually has a right to fight for the world
championship Saturday when he faces John Ruiz, and he contends he
should be champion anyway because he should have been given the
decision against Lennox Lewis in their second bout.
</P>
<P>
   OK, technically, he's right on the first count. He and Ruiz
!ital!are fighting for the WBA version of the title that was
stripped from Lewis when he refused to fight the No. 1 contender,
Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   However, everyone knows that Lewis _ holder of the IBF and WBC
belts _ is the man no matter what happens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Holyfield-Ruiz is a sham of sorts. Lewis twice
beat Holyfield (once officially) and without question is the top
heavyweight in the world while Ruiz, a journeyman heavyweight, was
once knocked out in 19 seconds by David Tua.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Holyfield was among those who lobbied to have Lewis
stripped of his title even though he knows a divided heavyweight
championship is bad for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Holyfield disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't follow the rules, you lose your title,'' he said.
``I follow the rules. I fought (mandatory challenger Vaughn) Bean.
I would've had to fight (Henry) Akinwande (before the fight fell
through) or I would've been stripped of the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, we'll give him that point on a technicality. However, in
no way did he win his second bout with Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield barely concedes he lost their first bout, one which
almost all impartial observers saw as an easy victory for Lewis
that lousy (corrupt?) judges scored a draw.
</P>
<P>
   The second bout was closer but still a clear victory for Lewis,
whose combination of size and talent is too much for the smaller
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, it sounded a bit absurd when Holyfield said:
``Anybody who watched (the second) fight knows I did beat Lennox.
They always talk about the first fight. . . . The next fight, they
thought, 'We corrected it and made it right.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no complaint. I understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems as if Holyfield really !ital!doesn't
understand. For the sake of Lewis and the sport, at least the rest
of us do.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hype begins: Fernando Vargas tried to keep focus on his Aug.
26 bout with Ross Thompson during a teleconference call last week _
but he didn't try too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he's thrilled at the prospect of fighting Felix
Trinidad in December and couldn't keep his enthusiasm in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything I've ever wished for, everything I've prayed
to God for,'' said Vargas, a resident of Oxnard, Calif..
</P>
<P>
   The deal's not done yet, although both sides say they're very
close to an agreement for Dec. 2 in Las Vegas. If it happens, it
could be the best matchup yet among a rich pool of fighters in the
welterweight and junior middleweight divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the first question is about Vargas' relative lack of
experience: 19 pro fights. One wonders whether he'll experience a
fate similar to that of David Reid, another young fighter whom was
beaten unmercilessly by Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, 22, said he heard similar things before title fights
with Yory ``Boy'' Campas, Raul Marquez and Ike Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think David Reid had the mentality to deal with the
crowd, the magnitude of the fight,'' he said. ``He respected
Trinidad too much. I definitely believe he was thinking, `Oh, my
God. I'm fighting Felix Trinidad.'
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . I'm comfortable at this level, I've been able to perform
at this level. I feel I'm ready for Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   Another obvious question mark is Trinidad's undeniable power:
What will happen when Vargas gets tagged?
</P>
<P>
   Vargas contends he has a good chin _ ``My trainer (Eduardo
Garcia) says I have the jaw of a mule'' _ and results support that
contention: He's never been knocked down or seriously hurt.
However, he doesn't plan to allow Trinidad's power to become a
significant issue: He won't engage Trinidad in a brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an intelligent fighter,'' he said. ``If you go to war, you
get busted up and you have a good chance of getting knocked out
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to fight a smart war.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he doesn't believe Trinidad has any more power than he
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, he has power,'' Vargas said, ``but he has no
more power than I do and he's not a stronger junior middleweight
like some people think. I'm going to show that Aug. 26.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More Vargas: Some experts believe Vargas has surpassed Oscar
De La Hoya as a fighter, particularly after Vargas' impressive
victory over Ike Quartey and De La Hoya's losses to Trinidad and
Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas won't come out and say as much, but he certainly won't
argue with the prevailing thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just analyze it. Putting it simple, I make adjustments to beat
fighters, whatever that might be,'' he said, referring to De La
Hoya's inability to adjust when Mosley took control of their fight
in the final six rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas went on: ``I don't think you should blame the trainers
(for De La Hoya's performance). At the end of the day, you're the
one in the ring fighting. It's all up to you. You have to think,
`I'm getting blistered all over the place. I might as well change
up something,' maybe feint and come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane Mosley had a great fight plan, he fought a great
intelligent fight. He made Oscar fight his fight. I definitely
think De La Hoya went in a one-dimensional way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see when I fight, I box when I have to box and punch
when I have to punch. I beat everyone at their game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Friday is a busy day for boxing.
</P>

in Atlantic City, N.J., on ESPN2, which should be a typical
action-packed Robinson fight.

COMMENTARY:   EXEGESIS OF ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The well-accepted acceptance speech of George W.
Bush is worthy of an exegete's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Most moving and evocative passage: In his visit to a jail for
juveniles in Marlin, Texas, when a 15-year-old inmate asked him,
``What do you think of me?'' Bush perceptively interpreted the
question to mean, ``Do you, a white man in a suit, really care what
happens to me?'' He drew on John Donne's no-man-is-an-island
philosophy to decry the imprisoning wall of indifference separating
rich and poor, ambitious and despairing. Bush had alluded earlier
to the Berlin Wall that had come down ``with the leadership of
Presidents Reagan and Bush.'' He then connected the metaphor of the
jailed juvenile to Ronald Reagan's words in Cold War Berlin: We
must ``tear down that wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Most subtle play on discomfort of many Democrats with the
current president: He quoted Robert Frost, the poet older Americans
remember speaking in the cold at John F. Kennedy's inauguration, of
the dream of the nation's founders ``to occupy the land with
character.'' That reminder set up Bush's observation that ``a
president himself must be responsible,'' significantly followed by
his pledge to ``uphold the honor and dignity of the office,'' which
most voters believe Clinton failed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Most adept plays on phrases of previous presidents: Although Al
Gore now leads FDR's party, ``the only thing he has to offer is
fear itself.'' Bush had already improved on Clinton's phrase ``the
tyranny of low expectations'' with his own ``the soft bigotry of
low expectations'' and drove it home again in his acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Most useful verb to deride the opposition's misuse of
only-superpower status and economic boom: ``Instead of seizing this
moment, the Clinton-Gore administration has squandered it.'' This
word, of unknown origin but more mouth-filling than ``waste,''
should become a staple of Bush rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Most unexpected use of a code phrase to take an unequivocal
stand: ``I will lead our nation toward a culture that values ...
the life of the unborn.'' This definition of the fetus as alive,
which is unequivocally anti-abortion, showed the depths of his
pro-life belief and the nonpolitical reason for his refusal to
modify the GOP's extreme anti-abortion platform plank. It also gave
millions of Republican women clear reason to vote for his opponent,
which I suppose shows his confidence in holding his lead.
</P>
<P>
   Most uneven credo: This series of sentences beginning with ``I
believe,'' summing up the speaker's core beliefs, both soared and
stumbled. ``I believe in a God who calls us, not to judge our
neighbors, but to love them'' was especially welcomed by gays, and
there was tasteful eloquence in ``I believe in grace, because I
have seen it, in peace, because I have felt it, in forgiveness,
because I have needed it.'' But to cap this with ``And I believe
this will be a tough race, down to the wire'' was demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   On the debit side, more on substance than style:
</P>
<P>
   Running against Washington. The Yale graduate and child of
privilege assumed, Jimmy Carter style, a hardscrabble pose to
assert that his ``background may lack the polish of Washington.''
And then, following a focus-group distaste for controversy, he
dissociated himself from all investigations into Clinton-Gore
scandals, including illegal fund raising: ``I have no stake in the
bitter arguments of the last few years.'' Republicans on the
unpopular ramparts of the rule of law were coolly informed he
preferred ``civility and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Oversimplifying foreign and defense policy. ``When America uses
force in the world, the cause must be just, the goal must be clear
and the victory must be overwhelming.'' This is the old
Weinberger-Powell doctrine, and had it been applied in the Balkans
would have awarded Kosovo to Slobodan Milosevic. If Bush becomes
president, that all-or-nothing policy sentence _ denying limited
intervention _ will come back to haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   Feeble labeling. ``It is a time for new beginnings. ... I
believe America is ready for a new beginning.'' We are readier for
new sloganeering; Bush's ``New Beginning'' will go over as
thunderously as Clinton's ``New Covenant.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has put out word that he is composing his own acceptance.
Welcome to the world of speechwriting, Al; the nonpartisan blades
of exegesis go snicker-snack.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Six weeks after taking charge of Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign, William M. Daley has not
yet figured out where everybody works in the sprawling and frenetic
Gore headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, where's Mark's office?'' he sheepishly asked a young aide
one night last week, scrunching his bushy eyebrows as he wandered
right past the door to the lair of Mark Fabiani, the deputy
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in his short time here, the former commerce secretary
seems to have significantly revived the once flagging morale of the
Democratic campaign, both in Nashville and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   After a spring when the campaign was accused of squandering any
momentum created by Gore's victories in the Democratic primaries,
Daley has moved to curtail the infighting that had sapped the
campaign's energy and to impose badly needed discipline on its
strategy and message.
</P>
<P>
   He has freed Gore to focus on essential decisions rather than on
the power struggles back home, and he has reassured Democratic
partisans that the campaign is back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Top Gore supporters, including congressional leaders and
officials with major constituent groups, say that they have noticed
a distinct change since Daley replaced the ailing Tony Coelho, and
that they have been soothed by Daley's straightforward presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came and spoke to our caucus last week and the turnaround
in attitude that he brought was very noticeable,'' said Sen. Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader. ``He exuded a confidence
about the organization that my colleagues needed and wanted to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Sweeney, the AFL-CIO president, had initially complained
that he was not consulted about Gore's appointment of Daley, who
earned the enmity of labor by leading the administration's lobbying
for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the normalization
of trade relations with China. But after Daley spent two days this
week meeting with labor leaders in Chicago, Sweeney had nothing but
kind words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things are moving in the right direction,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``I think that since Al Gore named Bill
Daley to head up his campaign, Daley has been working extremely
hard on a number of fronts. And certainly I can say he's been
meeting with us regularly and making sure that working-family
issues are at the center of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest change in the campaign's leadership, its second in
barely a year, could have been deeply destabilizing. But as Gore
moves into two critical weeks in which he will select a running
mate and accept his party's nomination in Los Angeles, his aides
and leading supporters say they feel more optimism than at any
point since the vice president vanquished Bill Bradley and swept
the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morale is shockingly high here for a campaign that's 10 points
behind,'' one top Gore aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign, by almost any standard, had a lousy spring.
After the primaries, the campaign drifted for weeks with little
sign of a general-election strategy. Gore allowed Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas to cruise unchallenged back to the center after he
was forced to the right in the Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also manufactured its own crisis when the vice
president broke with the White House to maintain that Elian
Gonzalez should be given permanent residence status, a move seen as
such a craven appeal for Cuban-American votes that it reinforced
Bush's contention that the vice president would say anything for
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign experimented constantly with its message and its
tone, first attacking Bush stridently, then backing away. That,
too, only seemed to buttress the Republican criticism of Gore,
whose various public transformations inspired Bush to declare in
his acceptance speech at the Republican convention that he was
``not running in borrowed clothes.'' By late spring, Gore had
unwittingly made himself an underdog, consistently trailing in the
polls despite his association with the prosperity of the Clinton
era.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, a 51-year-old Chicago native, was not looking for work
when Gore woke him from a deep slumber at 12:15 a.m. on June 15 to
tell him that Coelho, who had led the campaign for a year, was
resigning for health reasons. He said he felt he had the best job
in government and was content to ride out the last six months of
the Clinton administration in his spacious office in Washington,
and on the golf course on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, who had spoken to Daley about leading the campaign a
year before, was insistent that he needed his considerable
political skills. ``I was out of it, I mean dead sound asleep,''
Daley said of the phone call. ``I said, `Well, why don't we get
together tomorrow and have a cup of coffee?' And he said, `Why
don't you get up and make a cup of coffee?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes later the deal was sealed, and Daley
immediately began to shed his duties at Commerce. He started full
time on July 17, commuting between Washington and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who is known for his straight talk, acknowledged in an
interview last week that the Gore campaign was troubled at the
time. ``It's not a secret that there was a period there of internal
debate on the thrust of the campaign,'' he said, ``a concern that
we had lost some ground from the primaries, that Bush was running a
good noncampaign campaign, that his base came home quicker and that
we were still working on our base.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the direction of the campaign had become a struggle
among distinct power bases: the paid staff, led by Coelho and Donna
Brazile, the campaign manager, who themselves had occasional
disputes; Washington consultants like Carter Eskew, Tad Devine,
Robert Shrum, Bill Knapp and the pollster Harrison Hickman, some of
whom have moved to Nashville; Gore family members, including Gore's
wife, Tipper, his daughter Karenna Gore Schiff and his
brother-in-law, Frank Hunger; staff members in the office of the
vice president in Washington; and old Gore hands like Peter Knight,
Roy Neel, Tom Downey and Jack Quinn, all of whom are now Washington
lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho, who resigned after suffering epileptic seizures and
intestinal problems, receives decidedly mixed reviews from Gore's
aides. He is deeply respected, almost revered, for having guided
Gore successfully through his primary fight with Bradley and for
obsessively pursuing goals like winning the endorsement of the
AFL-CIO. He and Brazile made difficult but needed cuts in staff and
budget and oversaw last fall's move of the campaign from Washington
to Nashville (the headquarters are now in an office park
conveniently situated on Mainstream Drive).
</P>
<P>
   But despite his long tenure as a congressman from California,
Coelho was never able to become the public face of the campaign,
largely because his role as leader of the U.S. exhibit at a 1998
world exposition in Portugal was the subject of a State Department
investigation into suspicions of financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   And by insisting on tight control of all aspects of the
campaign, including access to the candidate, he bred resentment and
alienation among many advisers with long relationships with Gore.
For instance, Quinn, a former Gore chief of staff, said he and
other former aides had felt ``underutilized'' during Coelho's
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The internal tensions were papered over while Gore aides made
common cause of defeating Bradley. But they re-emerged after the
primaries and all too often the candidate himself was called upon
to mediate, Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a lot of squirreling around here about the
battles, the personality disputes, and I think that sucked him into
it a lot,'' Daley said. ``I think he was having a lot of people
call him, you know, nyah, nyah, and you hear this about this one,
this about that one, this one's not doing this, nothing's being
done, yadda, yadda, yadda. And they were all going around each
other to him, and that's not the way it should be. The candidate
cannot be made to be put in that position, and I think he was being
put in that position by just about everybody here.''
</P>
<P>
   That has changed, Daley asserts. ``He's performing much better
because I think he's not burdened by worrying about the campaign as
much,'' he said. ``He's doing his thing. He's not the campaign
manager. He's not the chief issues person. He's the candidate, and
I think he's made that transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley's arrival coincided with the unveiling of the campaign's
latest message, a double-barreled populist appeal that casts Gore
as the candidate most likely to continue the country's prosperity
and Bush as the captive of powerful interests. Daley has insisted
that the campaign stick with those themes for the last month and
has encouraged the kind of dexterity that led Gore to rip up his
schedule one day in July and go to Texas to blame Bush for that
state's fiscal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be we couldn't stay on message for a week,'' one
senior Gore aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Fabiani, the campaign's communications director, said Daley had
brought ``an overall direction to the campaign so we can stay on
course no matter what happens, rather than being buffeted by events
and things beyond our control.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, a top strategist, said Daley had ``brought some stability
and confidence, and those are important in showing the external
world that there's a mission and a plan, and in giving the
candidate confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime Democratic operative, as well as the son of
Chicago's former mayor and the brother of its current one, Daley
has the advantages of vast connections in party politics and an
intimate knowledge of the Midwestern states that are expected to be
this fall's battlegrounds.
</P>
<P>
   He has presented the campaign's case in regular television
appearances, has become a key adviser on convention planning and
the vice-presidential selection; he is overseeing the expansion of
the campaign's paid staff from 75 people to 300.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought Ronald A. Klain, a former Gore chief of staff,
and Monica Dixon, a former deputy chief of staff, to Nashville to
invigorate the campaign's rapid response operation (known as ``the
kitchen''), a mainstay of the 1992 and 1996 Clinton campaigns. And
he has renewed contact with Gore allies who felt shut out,
prompting Quinn to observe that ``he's the sort of guy who leaves
no resource unused.''
</P>
<P>
   In a close election, such things can matter, several Gore aides
said. ``These campaigns are all about the candidates,'' Quinn said,
``but campaign leadership really does keep people rowing not only
in the right direction but rowing together.''

   While the European Union contends that opposition by U.S.

World Trade Organization to keep its telecommunications market
open, the United States is making similar arguments against Mexico.
</P>

the year 2000 scare, the government is much smarter about
information technology systems and processes, and it is directing
that knowledge to Internet purchasing efforts. Internet companies,
meanwhile, are looking for any market that can deliver revenue and

ANGELS SWEPT IN CLEVELAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Anaheim Angels remained 0 for August, and oh so
close to letting a promising season slip away, after a 5-2 loss to
the Cleveland Indians on Sunday before 43,133 at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians completed a three-game sweep of the Angels, who have
lost five in a row _ their longest losing streak of the season.
They are looking for their first win in August and fell eight games
behind first-place Seattle in the AL West, their largest deficit of
the season. They are only five games out in the wild-card race but
trail four teams (Oakland, Boston, Cleveland and Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, however, continue to say they will work things out,
that it's no time to panic. There are 50 games left in the season,
plenty of time to turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's still early enough to look at the big picture,''
Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``Obviously we're not going to
be complacent, thinking we're going to win playing the way we are
now. But we're too good a ballclub to stay in this rut.''
</P>
<P>
   The rut _ 11 losses in 15 games _ has been caused by a lack of
good starting pitching. The staff has been ravaged by injuries, but
even those who are healthy are not throwing well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's starter, Brian Cooper, has been trying to correct a
mechanical flaw in his delivery, but apparently he has work to do.
He lasted only 3 innings, allowing five runs and seven hits. Four
of the seven hits were home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper threw a three-hit shutout against the A's on June 30 but
has struggled since then. In his last six starts, he is 1-5 with a
9.42 ERA. He threw only one good game during that stretch, beating
the Padres on July 17 (6 innings, 2 runs, 4 hits).
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he regressed a little bit with his command,''
Scioscia said. ``He couldn't locate the ball, he couldn't put
hitters away. For a sinker-ball pitcher to get hit like that is not
what we're looking for. But he'll get it ironed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he hopes Cooper (4-7) can get his problems fixed
in the majors, but a trip back to the minor leagues in not out of
the question. Ramon Ortiz has pitched well in Triple-A and Kent
Mercker should be ready in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four tough (starts) in a row, it's pretty easy to dwell on the
negative aspects,'' Cooper said. ``But if I stay away from that and
focus on the things I'm doing right, it should carry me from start
to start. . . . As long as they have confidence in me, I'll have
confidence in myself. Hopefully something will spark and get me
rolling in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper retired the first two batters he faced, then surrendered
back-to-back home runs to Roberto Alomar and Jim Thome. The Angels
tied it with two runs in the second, but Alomar homered again in
the third for a 3-2 Indians lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Einar Diaz followed a single by Bill Selby
with a two-run homer. Cooper didn't make it out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels bullpen pitched well, throwing 4 scoreless innings.
But the Angels offense couldn't get back in it.
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Bartolo Colon (10-8), who hit 99 mph on the
Jacobs Field radar gun several times, gave up two runs and six hits
in seven-plus innings, striking out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Colon also walked five batters, but the Angels failed to take
advantage. The Angels went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring
position, the only hit being Kevin Stocker's RBI double in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a pretty good disciplined approach with
(Colon),'' Scioscia said. ``We had plenty of opportunities early in
the game but couldn't get the key hit that would have changed the
complexion of the game.''

DEMOCRACY ADVOCATE IN EGYPT ACCUSED OF ESPIONAGE  

</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ A state prosecutor on Sunday expanded the list of
accusations against Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a prominent democracy
advocate, to include espionage for the United States, his lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, who has been detained since June 30 without being
formally charged, is accused of revealing Egyptian security secrets
while speaking at a 1994 conference on Egyptian-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Farid al-Deeb, one of his defense lawyers, said the new
accusation was raised in the latest interrogation of Ibrahim, a
sociologist who also holds American citizenship and who has been
active in human rights work and election monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Spying is the most serious of the complaints brought against him
so far and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are baffled by this new accusation,'' said his wife,
Barbara Ibrahim, in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   No one in President Hosni Mubarak's government has commented
publicly on the case. But Ibrahim, and his supporters, have said
they believe he is being punished for his plan to set up
independent monitors for the parliamentary elections scheduled for
November.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's National Democratic Party holds 97 percent of the
seats in the People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim's case has drawn considerable international attention at
a time of rising tensions between Egypt and the United States over
the faltering Palestinian-Israeli peace efforts. Clinton
administration officials have accused Egypt of being uncooperative
by not pressuring Palestinians to accept an offer on the status of
Jerusalem, a charge that officials here vehemently deny.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, every government-subsidized newspaper has run
editorials attacking President Clinton, accusing him of being
biased in favor of Israel and insensitive to Egypt's foreign policy
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The continued detention of Ibrahim has only intensified the
friction. The State Department, questioning Egypt's commitment to
human rights, has urged authorities to clarify the charges against
him or release him.
</P>
<P>
   No formal charges have been brought against Ibrahim, but the
State Security Court has twice extended his original 15-day
detention period.
</P>
<P>
   To keep him imprisoned longer without charge, authorities would
have to resort to Egypt's emergency law, which permits detention of
up to six months without charge. The law, generally used to detain
suspected terrorists and political prisoners, has been in effect
since 1981, when former President Anwar Sadat was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   In previous interrogations, according to his lawyers, Ibrahim
has been accused of defaming Egypt by producing a get-out-the-vote
film, of misusing foreign funds in his social research
organization, of sowing sectarian hatred through his research into
Muslim-Christian relations and of having unauthorized contacts with
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen employees of Ibrahim's Ibn Khaldun Center Development
Studies in Cairo have also been imprisoned. The center itself has
been closed by security forces, as has a related center that was
promoting women's electoral participation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the playwright who wrote the script for the film on
voter participation, Ali Salem, has been charged with threatening
national security because of his connection with Ibrahim. The film,
which has never been released, was financed with a grant from the
European Union and urges Egyptians to shed their apathy and vote.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage accusation concerns a conference that was attended
by Ibrahim and a number of diplomats from the Egyptian Embassy in
Washington _ a present Egyptian government minister, Ali el-Din
Hilal; members of a research organization financed by the Egyptian
government; the former Egyptian ambassador to Canada, Tahseen
Bashir; and representatives of the U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Deeb said that Ibrahim spoke at the conference about his
research into Islamic extremism in Egypt.

 &HT;    BellSouth to create high-speed Internet system
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth today will announce plans to build a
high-speed Internet system near Miami that will carry huge amounts
of data arriving from overseas, helping to relieve congestion in
much of the equipment now used by Internet companies in the
Southeast. Construction will be done by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting in a 20-lane cloverleaf,'' said Susan
Campbell, director of Internet strategy and business development at
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Most data traffic in the United States passes through one of the
seven public ``network access points.'' Some large data carriers
have their own private access points, accessible only to companies
who contract to connect.
</P>
<P>
   But no public access point has been built since 1996 _ and
Internet traffic has been doubling every two or three months. So
like a transportation system in a growing economy, the spectacular
growth of the Net has outpaced those systems' ability to carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Internet-transmitted video often appears jittery
and jerky, because congestion has slowed transmission of the signal
to a relative crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration with that flaw is bound to increase as home Net
users plunk down more money to get high-speed access _ broadband _
only to find their use can be disrupted by jams in data traffic
hundreds of miles distant, Campbell said. ``The Internet really has
got to move to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Addition of an eighth public access point could help relieve
that congestion, at least in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, BellSouth will use fiber optics _ a faster, more
reliable technology than that of any other public access point, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company knows of no other public access point planned with
optical technology, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has for years been pouring resources into fiber and
now manages more than 2.8 million miles of fiber in its nine-state
region.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has not decided whose equipment to use, and says only
that the project has a ``multimillion- dollar'' cost.
</P>
<P>
   The $26 billion-a-year company will reap revenues from the
companies that connect, with fees based on how much data is
handled. Signed up so far to connect with the BellSouth system are
the Internet service providers run by FPL FiberNet, Qwest,
International Wireless, UUNet, Intermedia, NetRail and Diveo.

NRA, MANY GUN OWNERS SEE BUSH AS A FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ark., Maine, Ill., N.Y.)   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One expectation of anyone running for governor
of Texas is that he or she must grab a gun and shoot something. So
in 1994, George W. Bush, then the Republican candidate for
governor, borrowed a 20-gauge shotgun and invited a group of
reporters on a dove hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the dawn mist, Bush fired seven times, bagged a bird for the
cameras, and then left to continue campaigning. But the dead bird
turned out to be a killdeer, a protected species, and a photo
opportunity meant to underscore Bush's kinship with gun owners
instead became an embarrassment, as he paid a small fine and
apologized for his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the eyes of gun owners in Texas and national gun-lobbying
groups like the National Rifle Association, Bush's illegal shot was
the last mistake he has made. The NRA's chief lobbyist in
Washington, James Jay Baker, could not recall a single instance in
which Bush, as governor, had opposed the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I can remember,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record has been decidedly sympathetic to gun owners. He
has signed far-reaching pro-gun legislation, including a 1995 law
making it legal to carry concealed weapons, an expansion of that
law in 1997, and a 1999 law making it extremely difficult for
cities to sue gun manufacturers. One national survey by a
gun-control group found that only three states _ Louisiana,
Arkansas and Maine _ had looser gun laws than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This stance has earned Bush many admirers in Texas, where guns
are entwined in the culture. But it has also galvanized his
opponents in this presidential campaign, from gun-control groups to
Vice President Al Gore, who have eagerly tried to cast Bush as a
willing pawn of the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore are using the gun issue to pursue broader
themes of attack. Gore has cited Bush's pro-gun record to try to
marry the Texas governor to his party's right wing, and, in
contrast, has offered a string of gun-control proposals. Bush's
aides, noting that Gore once opposed gun control, only to change
his position, have used the issue as part of their effort to depict
Gore as opportunistic.
</P>
<P>
   Both the rifle association and the leading gun-control group,
Handgun Control Inc., are treating this election as historic.
Handgun Control ran commercials attacking Bush during the
Republican National Convention and will continue to do so. Baker,
who said the NRA would spend $15 million in this year's election
campaigns, said that the candidates' divergent views on guns made
this presidential race the most important in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's supporters say he has put Texas in the national
mainstream with the 30 other states that have similar laws allowing
the carrying of concealed weapons. But his critics note that
several other Republican governors, including George Ryan in
Illinois and George Pataki in New York, have pushed for stronger
gun laws. Bush supports better enforcement of existing laws, as
does the rifle association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a Texas governor that compares to Bush in
carrying water for the NRA,'' said Nina Butts, president of Texans
Against Gun Violence, a gun-control group.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a high-ranking NRA official was videotaped telling
supporters that in a Bush presidency, ``we work out of their
office.'' The official said the association and Bush would have
``unbelievably friendly relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush bristled at that remark and has sought to signal his
independence from the association by endorsing ideas that include
background checks on the buyers of firearms at gun shows and
raising the minimum age for buying handguns to 21 from 18. This
spring, when the Million Mom March on Washington was held in
support of gun control, Bush announced that he would spend $1
million a year of state money to to hand out free trigger locks to
handgun owners. He said that if elected president, he would support
a similar national program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be times when we agree and times when we
disagree,'' Bush said of the NRA in an interview in March.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's critics are skeptical that he has been converted.
They note that Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, has long opposed
gun control. As a Republican congressman from Wyoming, Cheney was
among only 21 House members who voted against banning so-called
cop-killer bullets. In 1988, Cheney voted against a ban on plastic
guns that could pass through airport security.
</P>
<P>
   And the critics note that Bush declined to put his clout behind
gun-show background checks in Texas even though he is now
supporting them nationally. ``Bush is out on the campaign trail
running for president in a country where parents are very concerned
about gun violence,'' Butts said, ``and he's making promises that
have nothing to do with his record in Texas.''
</P>

<P>
   Texas residents recall that Bush ran for governor on four issues
in 1994 _ juvenile justice, tort changes, and overhauling education
and welfare. But guns were also an issue. The incumbent Democrat,
Ann Richards, had vetoed a 1993 bill to permit a statewide
referendum on allowing Texans to carry concealed weapons. Bush
pledged to sign such a bill, and gun lobbyists now say the issue
was critical to his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush ran against Ann Richards largely on the
right-to-carry issue,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Legislature again passed a concealed-weapons bill.
Many law enforcement agencies, including the Texas Association of
Police Chiefs, opposed the bill, but Bush, as he had promised,
signed it into law. The law, which did not require a referendum,
allows residents to carry hidden weapons if they undergo a
background check and 10 to 15 hours of training. Two years later,
Bush signed an amendment that allowed people to carry concealed
weapons into previously excluded institutions, including churches,
nursing homes and hospitals, unless those institutions expressly
prohibited it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters were pleased, but if they regard Bush as
an ally, they do not consider him a soul mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is being given the mantle of the pro-gun zealot and he's
really not,'' said Jerry Patterson, a former Republican state
senator who was a chief sponsor of the concealed-weapons bills in
1995 and 1997. Guns had ``never been a hot button issue'' for the
governor, said Patterson, who claimed that some ``pro-gun people
are not comfortable'' with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   He said of Bush: ``He made a commitment and lived up to his
commitment. This issue is not high on his list of priorities. I
would say it's probably not even on his list of priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control supporters were outraged, particularly by the
provision involving churches. Patterson said it had been in
response to complaints from pastors who could not carry their
weapons onto the grounds of their own churches. As of July 3, state
statistics showed that 212,969 Texans had licenses to carry
concealed weapons, and Bush has argued that the law has made Texas
safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that Texans supported,'' said Bush's
spokesman, Dan Bartlett, of the overall legislation, noting that
the crime wave predicted by opponents never materialized. ``It's a
rigorous process to go through. Law-abiding citizens should have
the ability to protect themselves and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates say crime has fallen in Texas because of
larger national trends, not concealed weapons, and point to studies
that show that many gun owners with concealed-weapons permits have
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A 1999 report by the Violence Policy Center, a national
gun-control group, showed that Texans with licenses to carry
concealed handguns were arrested in connection with 2,080 crimes
from 1996 through 1998, from drunken driving and burglary to rape
and murder.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle association shifted emphasis in 1999, beginning a
nationwide effort to blunt lawsuits filed by cities against gun
manufacturers. In Texas, which includes three of the nation's 10
largest cities, the Legislature passed a bill prohibiting such
municipal lawsuits, though it did allow the state attorney general
to file such suits. Bush signed the law and has suggested that he
would sign similar federal legislation if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider that in the gun-control debate,'' Bartlett
said. ``That is a tort reform measure.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When asked about gun control, Bush often repeats the theme that
government should enforce existing laws, not restrict the rights of
law-abiding citizens. As part of his juvenile-justice package, Bush
increased the penalties for minors committing crimes with a gun. In
1999, he helped institute the Texas Exile Program, which helps
local law enforcement agencies prosecute gun crimes under stricter
federal sentencing guidelines. In 1995, he signed the Texas Child
Access Prevention law, which holds adults criminally responsible
for not keeping loaded guns out of the hands of children.
</P>
<P>
   But while gun-control advocates applauded the child access law,
they noted that it included something for the NRA _ a provision
that ``strongly encouraged'' school districts to provide gun-safety
programs beginning in kindergarten. And the provision instructed
schools that the safety program must comply with the rifle
association's safety course for children, with the cartoon
character Eddie Eagle, essentially allowing the association to
dictate the curriculum. Critics equate the Eddie Eagle program with
the cigarette industry's use of Joe Camel to entice teen-agers to
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, gun-control advocates in Texas say Bush should be
judged not only by what he has done, but what he has not. Last
year, Debra Danburg, a Democratic state representative from
Houston, introduced a bill to close the loophole that allows people
to buy weapons at gun shows from unlicensed sellers without a
background check. Texas has the most gun shows of any state, with
472 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Columbine High School shootings, Bush said that
a popular culture that romanticizes violence had been partly to
blame. But in remarks to reporters, Bush endorsed the idea of
background checks at gun shows. This stunned Danburg. Just hours
before the governor's comments, Danburg's bill had died in a House
committee. Bush had done nothing to get the bill passed.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure quickly built for Bush to revive the Danburg bill, but
he refused, declaring it dead and telling reporters that ``it
really needs to be worked out at the federal level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides and pro-gun lobbyists say the Danburg bill was
flawed and would have essentially closed down all gun shows.
Danburg said she would have amended the bill and could have passed
it, if Bush had helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he supported it, he should have put his money where his
mouth is,'' she said. Danburg, who sponsored a resolution in
support of the Eddie Eagle program, calls herself a moderate on the
issue. But she said the governor was listening to only one side of
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made enough promises to extremists who are pro-gun that
they have passionately adopted him,'' she said. ``Yet he doesn't
talk with people who are concerned with gun safety. We're not
invited inside the big tent.''

SURGEON'S SUICIDE LEAVES ARGENTINES MOURNING AND PONDERING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio)   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ It has been more than a week since Dr.
Rene Favaloro, Argentina's most esteemed surgeon and a pioneer in
heart bypass surgery, committed suicide. But the outpouring of
grief seems to be growing more intense day by day, opening a
channel of despair so deep that Argentines are raising the deepest
of questions about themselves and their country.
</P>
<P>
   As wreaths of flowers pile up in front of Favaloro's research
foundation, newspapers are publishing extra columns of letters to
the editor in a deluge of long, sorrowful and often bitter
diatribes blaming the entire society for the suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro's photograph is on the cover of seemingly every
magazine, and articles are recounting the suicide in gruesome
detail, while the country's most important writers speculate about
what Favaloro's death means. There has been blanket television
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Argentines, especially Portenos as residents of this capital are
known, are among the most psychoanalyzed people in the world.
Depression is a topic of everyday conversation of people of all
classes, and Argentines are not shy about complaining about
everything from the weather to the pressures of their jobs.
Funerals and cemeteries are elaborate, and suicide is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something so distinctive about Favaloro's death
that it goes well beyond the national fixation with neurosis and
death. Some analysts say that the national mourning could be just
the epiphany Argentines need to kick themselves out of their
lethargy and the long decline the nation has suffered since its
economic and cultural heyday in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Sabato, Argentina's leading novelist, noted that it was
``profoundly tragic'' that one of Argentina's most creative sons
would feel so ``desperate and impotent'' that he would end his own
life. But he added, ``I ask myself if this sadness that is draining
all of us might just jolt us out of our inertia. Perhaps that was
his final wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking may well be wishful in the extreme, an example of
what one newspaper article characterized as an Argentine propensity
to swing from despair to euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of smoke-filled cafes here these days is about how
Favaloro's death is just one more symptom reflecting a country in
which a deep two-year recession has ravaged the middle class,
forcing the best and brightest to stand in line at the American,
Spanish and Brazilian embassies seeking visas to work elsewhere. It
has also spurred a debate about health care in Argentina, and how
the country does not put enough resources into scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay titled ``The Sad Land of Psychoanalysis and Tango,''
published Sunday in La Nacion, the country's most prestigious
newspaper, Favaloro's death was linked to a deep national
melancholia. ``Millions of Argentines, trapped by unemployment and
recession, are confronting an insecure future with anguish,'' wrote
Claudio Ivan Remeseira in the essay. ``The death of Rene Favaloro
marked a transcendent moment in this climate of frustrated
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Fernando De la Rua has been put on the
defensive, as reports emerged that the surgeon sent him a letter
crying out for help just days before he shot himself in the chest.
It was more than awkward, and some said it was heartless, when the
presidential palace put out a statement early last week denying
that the government was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old heart surgeon had a rags to riches life story.
The son of a seamstress and carpenter who grew up in the provincial
city of La Plata, Favaloro managed to become one of the world's
best known doctors. While working at the Cleveland Clinic in 1967,
he performed a bypass around a deadly coronary blockage. Although
other doctors had performed a similar surgery earlier, those
procedures were done under emergency conditions after patients
deteriorated on the operating table.
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro's procedure was planned, and he became the first to
report on it in a medical journal.
</P>
<P>
   After his success in America, he returned to Argentina and
founded a foundation dedicated to heart transplants and research.
It is among the most important medical facilities in South America.
Beloved and respected, Favaloro was repeatedly mentioned over the
years as a possible presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But along with the Argentine economy, the Favaloro Foundation
had fallen on hard times in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Favaloro was found dead by his brother and secretary in a
bathroom of his apartment in the upscale Palermo neighborhood on
July 29, a .38 caliber pistol beside his body. No foul play has
been suggested.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, the press has revealed that the Favaloro
Foundation was being sued by the government because it was behind
in paying Social Security contributions to its employees even while
the government reportedly owed the foundation a more substantial
sum of money for unpaid services to a public retirement institute.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation of the government suit came from a federal judge,
Julio Cruciani, who bitterly complained that ``this is a country
that comes down hard on people who are doers.''
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua's handling of the death has been criticized as clumsy
and is at least partially fueling all the hand-wringing.
</P>
<P>
   His immediate response to the news of the suicide was to issue a
special decree expressing that the nation was in mourning. But over
the next few days, the Argentine press revealed that before his
death Favaloro had made a desperate appeal to the president to help
him solicit financial support for his foundation from businesses.
De la Rua said he received the letter only a day before the
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has no guilt to wash off its hands nor does it
want to enter the debate over whether or not someone is to blame,''
Jorge De la Rua, the president's brother and chief of staff, was
quoted as saying in the local press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unjust to attribute to the government of Fernando
De la Rua the responsibility for these tragedies _ the emigration
of so many young people, the worsening poverty, the suicide of an
exceptional scientist,'' wrote Tomas Eloy Martinez, one of
Argentina's leading writers. ``But all these things are alarming
symptoms that we cannot pretend not to see.''

<P>
   Last December, when the government was in the throes of Year
2000 anxiety, e-commerce initiatives barely crossed the minds of
many federal officials. Not that e-commerce executives particularly
cared: With their companies' stock prices climbing and much larger
markets in their sights, they could afford to look past the
government as a place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the only Year 2000 disaster has turned out to be the
stock prices of dot-com businesses, Internet executives and federal
officials are taking a much closer look at one another. Thanks in
part to the Year 2000 scare, the government is much smarter about
information technology systems and processes, and it is now
directing that knowledge to Internet purchasing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, meanwhile, are looking for any market that
can deliver revenue and keep their businesses afloat as the dot-com
consolidation continues. The goal is not only to sell goods to the
government to help build its e-commerce systems, but to provide
goods that government purchasing agents can buy through those same
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet buzzcronym for this market is B2G, for business to
government, and the numbers involved are large enough to get just
about any dot-com's attention. The federal government will spend
hundreds of millions of dollars building its e-commerce systems
over the next five years, according to the Gartner Group, a
technology research firm. And as those systems improve, the
analysts say, the government should be able to move a large part of
its $260 billion in annual purchases onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the race to B2G. But as dot-coms have begun to chase those
dollars, they are finding that doing business with the government
frequently requires two things Internet companies lack: time and
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's tremendous potential there,'' said Christopher
Baum, a Gartner Group analyst. ``But when you peer over the edge,
you start to see a lot of rocks down there. It's like cliff-diving
in Acapulco with the tide going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Washington was still far from having its computer
systems set up so that private businesses could easily integrate
their own Internet-based purchasing systems with those of the
government. Such systems, for instance, might enable a vendor to
display its catalog of office furniture on agency purchasing sites
with little need to fine-tune it for each site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even the largest businesses can afford to set up separate
interfaces with even the biggest government agencies,'' Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, he said, the government would also streamline the
payment clearing process so that vendors on various agency Web
sites could clear payments electronically through one source,
instead of several.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several obstacles that could slow such
initiatives, analysts and government leaders said. According to a
report to be released Monday by the META Group, a technology
research and consulting firm, federal employees involved in the
government's e-commerce efforts said the biggest short-term
obstacle was lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the META Group, government agencies could halve the
average cost of processing an order _ to $10 from the current $20 _
by using the Internet. But even in a time of budget surpluses,
officials said they had a difficult time persuading members of
Congress to invest in e-commerce programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of money is hard to get,'' an official said. ``If I
say, `Give me $10 million and I can save $50 million,' the benefit
of that $50 million saved doesn't necessarily accrue to the glory
of the people who make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   That thinking could change if either political party were to
seize on the issue as campaign fodder. But changing the business
culture within the government so that e-commerce can be adopted may
be more difficult, longtime agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to operate in Internet time, not Washington time,''
said David J. Barram, administrator of the General Services
Administration, which oversees the procurement of about $40 billion
in annual goods and services for federal agencies. ``But it's very
hard because people don't want to make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought is, `Somebody's going to get you,''' Barram
continued. ``It might be Congress. It might be a partisan attack
from another party. But the ethic is to not take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Barram's agency was the federal government's
biggest e-commerce success. In 1996, it started an online ordering
site, GSAAdvantage.gov, which now lists more than a million items
and last year sold more than $100 million in goods to government
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Because more than 90 percent of the financing for the General
Services Administration comes from its own operations _ it collects
transaction fees from vendors who sell to the government _ Barram
said his agency's workers were somewhat less worried about having
their financing withdrawn if they made mistakes. That ethic, plus
the fact that the agency holds the purse strings to many online
federal purchases, has made it a primary target for dot-coms
wanting to get a piece of the business-to-government pie.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet company, MobShop, recently began working with the
agency's Federal Supply Service to offer so-called group purchasing
on the Buyers.gov site, which will roll out this month. In group
purchasing, suppliers offer an item for sale at a progressively
lower price as greater numbers of prospective buyers express
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rose, MobShop's chief executive, said that even within the
General Services Administration, it could be difficult bridging
what he called the huge gulf between the culture of an Internet
company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge opportunity for us,'' he said, ``because the
government has the heft to do a lot of things. But there are all
sorts of processes that don't make a lot of sense that you have to
work within.''
</P>
<P>
   Those processes are even harder for an Internet company to
accept, he said, because in the current market, dot-coms do not
have unlimited resources to spend on projects that might not
generate revenue quickly. ``There is a point where everybody will
sit down and ask, `Is this worth doing?''' Rose said. ``I don't
know where that point is. It's a constant game of assessing how
best to use our resources.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those companies that can wait long enough, the benefits
can be substantial. The Dell Computer Corp., which began selling to
the government online in 1996, will sell roughly $400 million worth
of computers to federal workers on the Internet this year. Aside
from the obvious revenue increase, Dell also saves time and money
by moving these purchases online, according to Tom Buchsbaum, vice
president for federal systems at Dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cuts the order-cycle time for us,'' Buchsbaum said, ``and
we don't have to cut a purchase order and have it processed. But it
also makes all of government available to us at the click of a
mouse, instead of having to get in a plane to D.C. to get things
together. It certainly broadens our reach.''

HERNANDEZ COMEBACK SPOILED AS MARINERS ROUT YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez has a familiar pose whenever a game
starts to crumble around him. He slouches his body, pins his right
hand on his waist like someone who is impatiently waiting in line
for a driver's license and peers out to where another damaging hit
has just landed. ``How did that happen?'' El Duque seems to be
saying to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck the pose often on an overcast day at Yankee
Stadium, a day that did not last too long for the sluggish pitcher
or for the Yankees. El Duque had not started a game in 24 days, he
had difficulty throwing strikes and he wondered why the Seattle
Mariners were pummeling the strikes he did throw in coasting to an
11-1 victory. ``How did this happen?'' El Duque surely said to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It happened because the Mariners were patient. They made a rusty
Hernandez work deep into counts and then they treated a pitcher who
was considered one of the best in American League in April like an
impostor. Hernandez trudged back to the dugout after the fourth
inning as if he were walking over land mines, knowing that his
long-anticipated return to the rotation ended in an 85-pitch
debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was very frustrated because, like he does most of
the time and like we do, when he goes out there, we expect him to
shut down the opposition,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``He wasn't
able to do that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was on the disabled list with a sprained right elbow
and back spasms, but he did not blame the five earned runs on eight
hits and three walks on any physical discomfort. Hernandez had a
strong fastball and a decent slider. He simply did not locate his
pitches precisely and the Mariners waited, pounced and then rode
Paul Abbott's eight excellent innings to the rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to battle,'' Jorge Posada said about Hernandez.
``You could see that he was in a battle. He was frustrated with
himself. They were laying off some tough pitches and I think he got
frustrated a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Torre and Posada both called Hernandez frustrated and
although El Duque's body language revealed exasperation, he
bristled when he was asked about being frustrated after matching
his second-shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't win and we didn't win,'' Hernandez said through Leo
Astacio, his interpreter. ``Frustration is for the weak and I don't
consider myself weak.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a lost weekend for Hernandez, who returned from
rehabilitating in Tampa, Fla., on Friday and immediately created a
controversy by asserting that one of the Yankees' coaches
supposedly said he was not ``as hurt as much as I thought.'' Torre
was understandably upset with Hernandez's charge, which the pitcher
tried to minimize by apologizing to the coaches on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for making them feel bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Torre admitted that Hernandez's words would probably not
evaporate. Hernandez said it to reporters and, regardless of his
retraction, everyone knows what he said after returning from
working under Billy Connors, the Yankees' vice president and
pitching instructor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will always be that little thing out there, that
element of question,'' Torre said. ``Sometimes we magnify things.
As far as I'm concerned, he has had so much support from everyone
here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hernandez and Allen Watson were drilled, Abbott used a
fastball and a change-up to disarm the Yanks and win for the second
time in seven starts. The Yankees began three innings with runners
on first and second, but Abbott induced double plays each time.
After Bernie Williams homered in the fourth, the Yankees loaded the
bases and stranded all three runners. Abbott did not give up a hit
in eight at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a buzz saw,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Hernandez never looked comfortable. He wore a
blue, long-sleeve shirt on a 76-degree day and jogged out to the
mound seconds before the national anthem began. After Hernandez
went ahead 0-2 on Stan Javier, he threw three straight balls before
Javier singled to right field for his first of five hits. One out
later, Alex Rodriguez looped a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had a 1-1 count on Edgar Martinez when he threw a
fastball up and in to give Martinez a different look or maybe get
him to foul off the pitch. But Martinez's quick, compact swing
enabled him to hammer a pitch that was near his eyes over the
left-field fence, giving the Mariners a 3-0 bulge and giving him a
major league best 103 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems like he can hit a ball over his head,'' Posada said.
``He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   When the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre visited the mound after
Martinez's homer, Hernandez looked perturbed. Hernandez walked two
batters in the third, but he escaped unscathed from a bases-loaded
situation. He could not escape more danger in the fourth when four
of the first five batters slapped hits and the Mariners surged to a
5-0 lead, leaving Hernandez looking frustrated and wondering what
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, I feel good,'' Hernandez said.
``My elbow is fine. My back is fine. All the rest will solve
itself.'' &QL;

ITEMS, AND HISTORY, TAKEN FROM SAN ANTONIO MISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROSS E. MILLOY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Someone is stealing pieces of this city's
past, and whatever the motives, the thefts have stunned local
church officials, stumped the police, and saddened
heritage-conscious people.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime between midnight and dawn last Tuesday, thieves broke
into the 300-year-old San Juan Capistrano Mission near here and
stole three hand-carved 18th-century statues from the church's
altar, including one dating to 1731 that depicts the mission's
namesake, Giovanni de Capistrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is somebody who knew exactly what they were doing,'' said
the Rev. James Galvin, the mission's pastor. ``They studied the
church's routines, they brought their own equipment to enter the
building and hoist out the statues. This was not a casual thing,
but very well planned.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth theft from one of San Antonio's five Spanish
missions since June, when a 2-foot-tall statue of the Virgin Mary
disappeared from the nation's oldest church, Mission Conception.
Later that month, an antique thurible _ an incense-burning device _
was taken from the same church. And last month, four paintings on
wood of Our Lady of Guadalupe were chiseled from their frames at
San Juan Capistrano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've obviously got a pattern here,'' said Msgr. Larry
Stuebben, the vicar general of the Roman Catholic archdiocese.
``Someone is targeting the missions, and the entire city feels as
if we've been punched in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people living around those missions whose families
have lived there for 250 years,'' he said. ``The symbolic presence
of those churches and those artifacts in their midst is a very
important thing. Generations have grown up among these things, and
when they are taken, it seems as if nothing is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a city like this, where legends seem to inhabit every
street corner, the Spanish missions have always held a special
status.
</P>
<P>
   In equal parts forts, churches and social centers in the early
1700s, they rest today like a string of faded Old World pearls on a
23-mile Mission Trail that meanders along the banks of the San
Antonio River into downtown, ending at the most famous mission of
all, San Antonio de Valero _ better known as the Alamo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missions are also national parks,'' Stuebben said. ``It
would be as if someone chipped the nose off one of the presidents
on Mount Rushmore. They are seen as part of the heritage and life
of the whole community, not just the Catholic community, and that
just adds another awful element to the whole tragic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the National Park Service said that although they
operate information booths at the missions during the day, the
properties are owned by the Catholic church, which is responsible
for security at the sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Stuebben said: ``Just keeping the buildings up is an
enormous expense. We can't afford to provide around-the-clock
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, church officials had kept silent about the robberies,
fearing that more attention would encourage copycat thefts. But
after last week's theft, Stuebben said it was decided to go public
to prevent the sale of the artifacts in the international art
market, although he would not speculate on their monetary value.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not sculpted by Michelangelo or anyone famous, and
they are not intrinsically valuable as art,'' he said. ``Their
value is in their history and their importance to the people of the
missions. What is 300 years of tradition and culture worth?''
</P>
<P>
   Gregoria Gaitan, 72, who says her family members have been
parishioners at Mission San Juan Capistrano for centuries, believes
money may not have been the object of the thefts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to go deeper than that,'' she said. ``This is someone
who was out to hurt the church. This is a poor church, not a rich
one. The statues are much more valuable to the people as history
than anything that someone could buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Gaigenmillar, a member of the church for more than 50
years, agreed. ``It's sickening. These statues aren't worth much
money; it's just a way of striking out at the people in the
church,'' he said, although he could offer no explanation for why
someone would do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can figure the mind of someone who would steal from a
church?'' Gaigenmillar said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for the San Antonio Police
Department, said the police were investigating but had no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Most church members and officials seem resigned to their loss,
and shaken by what the thefts say about contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sad that people do these things,'' Galvin said.
``The statues belong to the people. They are history itself.
Someone is taking lovely art out of people's lives, art that
everyone should be able to enjoy.''

FUND MANAGERS AT ODDS OVER USE OF DOMAIN NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANNY HAKIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas F. Marsico was a star money manager at Janus Capital
before he left three years ago to form his own company. But his
name, it seems, has found its way back to his old employer. Or at
least his domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a Web site called FundAlarm.com disclosed that Janus,
the United States' fifth-largest mutual fund manager, had
registered the domain name tommarsico.com. Actually the name was
registered by James P. Goff, manager of the $8.7 billion Janus
Enterprise fund. Goff, 36, said he registered it on his own last
December and not on behalf of Janus.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been plenty of dust-ups over domain names
before, this may be the first to involve two prominent investors
who manage billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were big shareholders of Network Solutions,'' Goff
explained, referring to the Internet company that until last year
controlled the registry of domain names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on there and got jimgoff.com,'' he said. ``Just for
kicks, I looked up Tom's and was surprised they hadn't reserved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsico, the 45-year-old chairman and chief executive of Marsico
Capital Management, which manages more than $15 billion, said he
was not aware until last week that the domain name had been
registered. He was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go out and buy domain names like that, they're
usually trying to do it for some benefit, selling it for a higher
price,'' he said. ``I was dumbfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Marsico managed the Janus Twenty fund and
was one of the industry's most prominent fund managers, appearing
often on the covers of financial magazines. He also helped recruit
talent to the firm, including Goff. Both men worked previously for
Fred Alger Management, a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Since his departure from Janus, Marsico has said little about
the firm. He and his former colleagues have had plenty on their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Bank of America bought the half of Marsico Capital
Management that it did not already own, for a total price of $1.1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Janus, meanwhile, lost a bitter dispute with its corporate
parent, Kansas City Southern Industries, which spun off Janus as an
entity called Stilwell Financial, over the objections of Janus
executives.
</P>
<P>
   What will be the fate of tommarsico.com?
</P>
<P>
   The World Intellectual Property Organization has ruled against
several companies that operated registered Web addresses
incorporating the names of Yahoo, AT&AMP;T and Microsoft. But the
Marsico case seems more likely to be settled on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, who belong to the same Denver-area country club,
met by chance last Wednesday. Goff said he apologized and offered
to return the domain name free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for fun, and it was a bad decision,'' Goff said,
adding that he had never set up any Web site at the address.
</P>
<P>
   Marsico was skeptical of Goff's explanation: ``This is a guy who
I brought to Janus. I got him into a country club he lives right
on. He doesn't say, `It's nice you sold your business,
congratulations.' It was, `By the way, since The New York Times
called me, I bought your domain name.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marsico did once try to register marsico.com, but he said it had
already been taken by a Pittsburgh company.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a man named Marsico there,'' he explained. Marsico
Capital uses the address marsicofunds.com as its home.
</P>
<P>
   As for tommarsico.com, Marsico said it had never occurred to him
to register the name.
</P>
<P>
   Will he take up Goff's offer and claim the site? When Goff
approached Marsico in a buffet line at the golf club, Marsico said
he was more interested in hitting the links than hearing about a
domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm protected,'' he said. ``If I ever wanted my name,
I could get it.''

LAWSUIT IS SYMBOL OF CHINA'S HOSTILITY TO JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ When Tang Weijiang slid a promotional compact
disc into his friend's computer last month, what he saw ruined his
day, and now he is asking Canon Inc. to pay $12 million in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Tang, 29, said he was furious that the Japanese company implied
on the disc, which promoted Canon's bubble-jet printers, that
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan are three separate countries. He said
he suffered mental distress from what he alleged was a deliberate
effort by Canon to undermine China's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Behind what outsiders might see as a quixotic lawsuit is a
deeper reason for Tang's reaction: China's long-simmering anger
toward Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong trade ties between the two countries, Japan
remains suspect in the eyes of many Chinese because of the Imperial
Japanese Army's horrendous behavior in China during the 1930s and
1940s, which included beheading contests and the mass rape and
murder of civilians in Nanjing. China estimates that as many as 35
million people died during the Japanese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   So visceral is China's animosity toward Japan that anything
short of demonizing wartime Japan is considered unpatriotic. Many
Chinese say openly that they hate the Japanese, though they don't
say so to the Japanese directly.
</P>
<P>
   The director Jiang Wen has been criticized for depicting the
Japanese too sympathetically in his film ``Devils on the
Doorstep,'' which won the Cannes Film Festival's Grand Prix in May
but has been banned in mainland China. The term ``devils'' refers
to Japanese of that period.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility creates a difficult environment for Japanese
companies operating here, even as Chinese are fast embracing
Japan's powerful popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese women, even in remote cities, teeter on cakelike
platform shoes and carry Hello Kitty handbags, all icons of Japan.
Casio G-Shock and Baby-G watches are the rage among teeny-boppers,
and sushi is an increasingly fashionable meal for the
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   But that shallow love affair can evaporate quickly when the
Chinese feel slighted.
</P>
<P>
   During demonstrations at Zhejiang University following NATO's
bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, last year, the
mood quickly turned from anti-American to anti-Japanese when a ball
being kicked around by a group of Japanese students playing soccer
inadvertently hit a student banner. The Japanese had to be
evacuated by police.
</P>
<P>
   And a university in the central city of Wuhan has banned the
rental of kimonos and Japanese swords to people posing for pictures
beneath blossoming cherry trees that were planted on campus by
Japan during the war. The university said the once popular practice
upset students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of propaganda have conditioned Chinese citizens to sense
slights regarding Taiwan, and the fact that the insult came from a
Japanese firm intensified Tang's reaction _ in Beijing's view,
Taiwan is a province of China, while Hong Kong, once a British
colony, is now a Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company mixed it up intentionally,'' said Tang, who sells
airline tickets in the central Chinese city of Chongqing. ``It hurt
the feelings of the Chinese people, and I felt hurt personally.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Japan has never fully apologized to China for its wartime
crimes. It maintains a shrine in China for fallen Japanese
soldiers, including seven class-A war criminals who were hanged.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori said Sunday that he would
not make an official visit to the shrine this month on the
anniversary of the end of World War II, although he did so last
year. His defense minister will visit it this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has never confessed its wrongdoings, from the 1894
Sino-Japanese War to the war in the 1940s, and now it is using
another approach to invade _ economic penetration,'' said Lu Lei,
Tang's lawyer, who is also suing Canon after finding similar errors
on the company's Web site. ``The country has political goals,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba Corp. is fighting an anti-Japanese media campaign that
accuses it of treating Chinese as second-class customers because
the company has offered to compensate American buyers of faulty
laptops but not Chinese buyers. The U.S. compensation was necessary
to avoid a costly legal case.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese consumers are now also suing Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   Canon was quick to issue a recall of the discs that led to the
current lawsuit and offered its Chinese customers an apology,
blaming an editing error.
</P>
<P>
   But Tang is unappeased, bolstered by the stone-faced seriousness
with which his case has been treated in the press. His vow to spend
the $12 million he is suing Canon for on schools in impoverished
areas of China, if he wins his case, has made him something of a
local hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't accept Canon's apology,'' said Tang. ``We need Canon
to apologize to all Chinese people.''

ASTRONOMERS DISCOVER 10 NEW PLANETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers are announcing this week that they have discovered
10 new planets and have found tantalizing hints of another
multi-planet system.
</P>
<P>
   Where there is one planet around a star, there are likely to be
more. At least that is the view of astronomers at the University of
California at Berkeley. The reason astronomers have not sighted
more multiple-planet systems, they say, is simply that they have
not looked long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers first found a planet around a Sun-like star only
five years ago. The count of planet-bearing stars has now passed
40, including the 10 that will be discussed this week, but of
these, only two have more than one planet.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the extrasolar planets discovered so far have been
detected indirectly _ their gravitational pull causes their parent
stars to wobble back and forth, which causes a slight wobble in the
wavelength of light coming from the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Debra A. Fischer, a postdoctoral fellow at Berkeley,
re-examined data from 12 stars known to have one planet to see if
they contained unnoticed evidence of other planets. ``Five of them
showed extra wobbles,'' Fischer said. ``That indicates the presence
of some other thing there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unseen bodies could be other planets, dim companion stars or
brown dwarfs _ small ``failed'' stars that were not quite massive
enough to light up.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are being presented at the International
Astronomical Union meeting which opens Monday in Manchester,
England.
</P>
<P>
   The only two known multiplanet star systems are Upsilon
Andromedae, 44 light-years away in the constellation Andromeda, and
HD 83443, which is 141 light-years away in the constellation Vela.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley team announced a year ago that they had found three
planets around Upsilon Andromedae. Astronomers led by Dr. Michel
Mayor of the Geneva Observatory in Switzerland announced the
discovery of one planet around HD 83443 in May and will present
data on the second planet at the astronomical union's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered planetary system provides a surprise to
astronomers: two gas giant-size planets very close to the star.
One, only 3.5 million miles away from the star, completes one orbit
in less than three days. The other completes its elliptical orbit
in only 30 days. Mercury, the innermost planet in the solar system,
is 35.5 million miles from the Sun and completes one orbit in 88
days.
</P>
<P>
   The HD 83443 system appears to be stable despite the
gravitational tuggings between the two planets and the star.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other planets discovered so far, the two around HD
83443 are also relatively small. One planet may be just slightly
more massive than Saturn; the other may be half as massive as
Saturn. Saturn is one-third the mass of Jupiter; most of the
extrasolar planets are several times larger than Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer and his colleagues also announced planets around five
other stars in addition to HD 83443. The Berkeley team announced
three new planet detections at the astronomical union's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Extrasolar planets have now appeared almost next door to the
solar system, too.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers led by Dr. William Cochran, a research scientist at
the McDonald Observatory of the University of Texas, announced the
discovery of a planet around a star only 10.5 light-years from
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The planet, around Epsilon Eridani in the constellation
Eridanus, is similar to Jupiter in its distance from its star, its
orbital period and its mass. But its highly eccentric orbit would
most likely disrupt the orbits of any Earth-like planets in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   That one of the nearest stars has a planet is by itself
encouraging to those looking for alien life or even civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, even when you look at the next sun out, it's got
planets, too,'' said Dr. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI
Institute, ``suggesting that planets are as common as cheap
hotels.'' The institute is a private organization conducting
research to determine whether intelligent life exists beyond Earth.

   She said the jury had heard the evidence about his mental
retardation and had reached its verdict, and that she supported the
jury's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak said that the jury had not been properly instructed to
consider evidence of mental retardation, as required by Supreme
Court rulings. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled recently
that while the instruction had not been given, it was not a fatal
constitutional error. Cruz filed an appeal on Friday with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On the general issue of whether the mentally retarded should be
executed, Reed said, ``I'm not willing to make a broad statement
for or against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people charged with capital murder are poor, and so are
represented by appointed lawyers. Many of these lawyers are
inexperienced, and even incompetent, and they often fail during the
mitigation phase of the trial to present the evidence of mental
retardation that could persuade the jury to spare their client's
life.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Ramon Martinez-Villareal is on death row after being
convicted of murdering two people. He has an IQ of 50 and also
suffers from brain damage, schizophrenia and dementia, according to
evidence presented by his lawyers in various appeals.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Martinez-Villareal's lawyer did not mention
his client's mental retardation. Martinez-Villareal, meanwhile, was
not able to tell the difference between the spectators and the
jury, his trial lawyer testified at a later hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the evidence of Martinez-Villareal's mental retardation,
brought out by Martinez-Villareal's postconviction attorneys, has
emerged, the trial judge and the prosecutor have said that
Villareal should not be executed. Nevertheless, Martinez-Villareal
remains on death row.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case involving a Texas death-row inmate, Johnny
Paul Penry, the Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that executing someone
who was mentally retarded was not ``cruel and unusual punishment''
in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, reversed the conviction of Penry for rape
and murder because the jury had not been instructed during the
mitigation phase of the trial that it could take into account his
mental condition in deciding whether to give him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Penry, who suffered brain damage at birth, and has an IQ of
about 60 and the mental ability of a 7-year-old, is still on death
row. His lawyers are preparing to return to Supreme Court. Now they
may win the argument that executing the mentally retarded is
unconstitutional, death penalty lawyers and constitutional scholars
say.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in Penry in 1989, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said that a ``national consensus'' had not developed
against executing the mentally retarded. At the time, only Georgia
and Maryland prohibited doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Since then 11 states have enacted laws that prohibit these
executions _ Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, and
Washington. Five other states came close to passing laws during
their most recent legislative sessions _ Illinois, Missouri,
Arizona, Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not said how many states would constitute
a ``national consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of the rights of the mentally retarded, one
of the strongest laws is Nebraska's, said Jerry Soucie, a lawyer
with the Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy, a state agency
that represents indigents in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was pushed by advocates for the mentally retarded
and the Roman Catholic Church, says that a person with an IQ below
70 is presumed to be mentally retarded, and requires a judge to
vacate a death sentence imposed before the law was passed, if he
finds by a ``preponderance of the evidence'' that the person was
mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was passed, two of the 10 men then on death row
had their sentences commuted to life in prison. One had an IQ of
68, the other 65.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois does not have a law prohibiting execution of the
mentally retarded, but Anthony Porter's mental deficiencies saved
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who was sentenced to die for the murder of two people,
and who has an IQ of 51, was 48 hours away from execution when the
state Supreme Court granted him a reprieve so that his mental
retardation could be investigated. The reprieve gave investigators
time to uncover evidence of Porter's innocence, and last year he
was exonerated and released from prison.

12-YEAR-OLD BUTTERFLY SPECIALIST SWIMS INTO OLYMPIC TRIALS (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jeff Caplan 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With dolphin-like swiftness and ease,
12-year-old Dana Vollmer has propelled herself from Granbury's
summer swimming league to a shot at the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Amid 1996 Olympic gold-medalists Jenny Thompson, Beth Botsford
and Andrea Beard, all of whom will converge on Indianapolis for
this week's U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, Dana is rapidly revealing
herself as a rising star. Sporting a lean frame of nearly 5-foot-9,
she is sharp, focused and bursting with talent.
</P>
<P>
   She regards Thompson, a two-time Olympian, as her ultimate hero
_ Thompson is the world record-holder in Vollmer's top event _ yet
her path to this point mirrors Botsford and Beard. Those two, both
sophomores at Arizona, rocketed onto the Olympic scene in Atlanta.
Beard was 14; Botsford was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dana has a chance to eclipse that when she takes the water
Wednesday in the 100-meter butterfly, though she is more likely a
serious contender for the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try really not to think about it because I get myself worked
up and nervous before the meet,'' Dana said Friday morning after
completing her final practice session at the Forest Park pool.
</P>
<P>
   A family play day at Hurricane Harbor was up next, only two days
before her scheduled arrival in America's heartland and braving a
new world: elite Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic-caliber swimming is unlike gymnastics or figure skating,
where younger often means better. Adolescent swimmers face an
upstream battle against fully developed athletes who have been
training and competing at a world-class level around the calendar
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Botsford and Beard were, Dana appears to be a prodigy
in the making. Until recently, Dana didn't register a blip on the
selective radar of the Fort Worth Area Swim Team (FAST), an
extension of USA Swimming and a year-round elite swim club. That is
a major difference from her youthful predecessors, who began
year-round training years before making the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Dana, remarkably, joined FAST only last September. Her parents,
Les and Cathy, a longtime swim coach who has tutored her daughter
for years, chose to forgo the life-changing commitment of full-time
training for a couple of reasons. The drive to Fort Worth and the
nearest Olympic-sized pool is 50 minutes from the Vollmers in
Granbury, but the drive was only part of the reason they didn't
make the trip regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coaching a long time, and I've seen a lot of young
kids that were really good get burned out really early and then
they quit,'' Cathy said. ``As soon as you switch over to full time,
it's full time from now until after college, and that's a lot. You
do have to keep reminding yourself that she's just 12, that she
needs to be a kid and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the switch to full-time training _ about 11 practices a
week for two-hour sessions twice a day, starting at 5:30 a.m.
coming up in the fall _ has come as naturally to Dana as the
butterfly stroke she started to perfect at age 5 when mom toted her
around in a backpack when she coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been people really good at 12, but not at the level
she is,'' said Ted Murphy of FAST, Dana's instructor since joining
the club. ``She is basically one-in-a-million. She is swimming in
senior national events. The top 1 percent of all swimmers are in
those meets.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof is in her times. In the past six months, Dana has set
three national age-group records in the butterfly. Two of those
records, the 50-yard and 50-meter butterfly had belonged to
Botsford, set in 1993. Dana's third record, in the 100-meter
butterfly, blasted an 18-year-old mark set by Jennifer Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Dana is so advanced that she doesn't swim against competitors
close to her own age. Instead, she is routinely blowing away
college-age swimmers at high-level meets.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dana: ``I don't think they really realize \Rmy age\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana's 100-meter national butterfly record of 1:03.07, set July
15 at the Junior National Southeast meet in Orlando, Fla.,
qualified her for the Olympic trials by two-hundredths of a second.
It is about four to five seconds off the pace she probably will
need to make the Olympic team, which carries two swimmers in each
event.
</P>
<P>
   She has two primary goals this week. Making the Olympic team is
the ultimate. On a more realistic level, Dana said she wants to
make the semifinals, which would put her in the top 16. Also, a
time of 1:02.21 would automatically place her on the U.S. National
Junior team, a squad that competes internationally and is the next
logical step on the road to the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Her rapid rise hardly seems to affect Dana, who will soon have
to make some athletic choices. This month, she will enter seventh
grade, the first year students can participate in scholastic
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play volleyball, basketball and track,'' she said.
``Right now, it sounds kind of weird, but I love basketball as much
as I love swimming. I hear things like, `But you're going to the
Olympic trials.' I've always dreamed of playing in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Calm and mature, the significance of her supersonic success and
a blazing bright future might be more incomprehensible right now
for Dana's parents than for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of ignoring it because it could be so big that it
would overwhelm me and therefore influence her,'' Les Vollmer said.
``This trip to Indianapolis, we are trying to find a bunch of
things to do, call it a vacation, and, oh by the way, on Wednesday
you're going to swim for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.'' nn

A POSSIBLE BID TO KEEP SEAGRAM IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Seagram Co., which is
being sold to Vivendi of France, is considering making a bid for
his company's liquor division, home to brands like Absolut vodka,
Captain Morgan rum and Chivas Regal scotch.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge Investments Ltd., Bronfman's privately held investment
group, has retained investment bankers at Bear Stearns to examine a
possible bid. Vivendi, a French conglomerate, is building its
entertainment and communications operations, but plans to sell the
liquor business.
</P>
<P>
   Several people close to Bronfman said Sunday that he was still
considering how to structure an offer, if indeed he bids at all.
However, his grandfather, Samuel, founded Seagram as a liquor
company. His nephew, Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chief executive of the
company, expanded it into entertainment properties.
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi has no interest in the liquor business and wants to shed
it to help reduce its debt of about $6.6 billion. Analysts have
speculated that the liquor operations could raise more than $7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reports have said that Charles Bronfman has hoped
that the business will remain family-owned. Phone calls to Claridge
and Bear Stearns were not returned Sunday. A spokesman for Seagram
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a person informed of the discussions said Charles Bronfman
was mulling how to put together a deal, including strategies that
involve joining with Bacardi-Martini, the privately held owner of
Bacardi rum, or with the owner of Absolut vodka, to which Seagram
already owns the worldwide distribution rights.
</P>
<P>
   Absolut's distribution deal stipulates that if Seagram is sold,
the Swedish distiller, the state-owned Vin and Spirit A.B. of
Stockholm, has the right to break its contract. One person
speculated Sunday that the Bronfmans might have some advantage in a
sale because the company and the family already have a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Other large liquor companies that could join the bidding for
Seagram's liquor operations are Diageo of Britain, which just sold
Pillsbury to General Foods for $10.6 billion, prompting analysts to
speculate that Diageo was raising money for a bid. Allied Domecq,
which owns brands like Beefeater gin and Ballantine's scotch, is
also expected to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those companies would have some economies of scale in
making an offer for Seagram that could make it easier for them to
raise their bids beyond the $7 billion to $8 billion that analysts
say the company is worth.

ICE-T'S TAKE ON NAPSTER, THE LAW AND MORALITY  
 A NEWS SERVICE CATERS TO NONPROFIT GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oliver Stone may have an equal in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   At an industry conference in Los Angeles last Tuesday, the
rapper Ice-T, a self-described ``conspiracy theorist type of guy,''
shared his views on the recording industry and the Napster
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records are free when on the radio, right?'' Ice-T said. The
recording companies, ``are tripping off the fact this stuff comes
through the computer clean,'' he said. ``That's the thing. When it
comes on the radio, you can tape it, I can send it to my homeboy.
But mail moves slow and the Internet moves faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ice-T's comments had his audience of about 400 people
roaring with laughter. The gathering was the Herring on Hollywood
2000 conference, sponsored by The Red Herring, a business magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the majors do is they go into gangster techniques,''
Ice-T said, referring to the major recording labels. ``Napster will
resurface in one of these major record companies as a way to share
files. Once they figure out how to take the technology and get paid
off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster, of course, is the service that lets people swap music
files over the Internet, often with little regard to copyrights.
The Recording Industry Association of America is suing Napster in
federal court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper also commented on the musicians _ including the
rapper Dr. Dre and the band Metallica _ who are suing Napster.
``Some lawyer wakes me up and says, `Man, we can get a couple of
million dollars.' And I'm like: `Sue whoever you gotta sue. Who is
Napster? What do they do?''' Ice-T said suing is for lawyers, not
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Why do so many people traffic in music they haven't paid for?
``To me,'' Ice-T said, ``you got the cops and the robbers. And to
me, I think human beings are naturally robbers. I think human
beings want it free. And that's just your nature. And if there is a
way around paying, that is what you are going to do. None of you
guys are moral enough to say I would rather pay $16 than get it
free.''

<P>
   A News Service Caters to Nonprofit Groups
</P>
<P>
   When the University of California at Berkeley announced two
weeks ago that physicists had peeled the tips off carbon nanotubes
_ an advance that may assist in the development of micromachines _
major newspapers did not put the arcane news on their front pages.
But at least they knew about the development.
</P>
<P>
   The news went out to the media by way of AScribe
(www.ascribe.org), an Internet-based distributor of news releases
for universities, nonprofit organizations and foundations.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days it has carried other announcements, like the
results of a Michigan State University study about the male
children of alcoholics and a new theory from the Jet Propulsion
Center about temperature cycles in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   If these subjects are not what most people would consider
newsworthy, that is partly the point. Because universities and
nonprofit groups often know that their news releases may have only
a narrow audience, they may be loath to spend several hundred
dollars to distribute a release over PR Newswire or Business Wire _
the two main services that corporate America relies on to
disseminate news releases.
</P>
<P>
   But by using software automation and the Internet to create a
low-cost way to distribute such releases, the founders of Ascribe _
Ron Wolf, a former business reporter, and David Irons, a former
university spokesman for Harvard and Berkeley _ are offering a
service that is meant to make ``public interest'' announcements
more accessible and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Some 250 colleges, universities and other organizations have
signed up for the service, paying $10 to $20 a release depending on
the subscription plan. Releases are e-mailed to AScribe in Oakland,
Calif., where they are copy-edited and then sent to news
organizations and Web sites through several means, including The
Associated Press and Dow Jones Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being paid to distribute the news releases, AScribe also
receives payment each time someone downloads a release through Dow
Jones. Most of the 150 Web sites that publish the releases also pay
AScribe. The company is now trying to attract venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, a former reporter for The San Jose Mercury News, said the
company hoped to develop relationships with thousands of
organizations that would use AScribe to publicize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great constituency for lots of other content besides
corporate financial news,'' he said.

BARNYARD SHOWDOWN: NEIGHBORS SAY ARTIST IS CREATING A CRASS
MENAGERIE
</HEADLINE>
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ Gines Serran-Pagan has a farm. And on this
farm he has some barns. And in those barns he kept some pigs and
chickens and rabbits and sheep and goats. And a llama. But the pigs
got loose and ate the neighbor's grass. The chickens flew the coop
and ate the neighbor's flowers. The rooster crowed at all hours and
disturbed the neighbor's sleep. The llama, the neighbors said, just
plain stunk.
</P>
<P>
   So now Pagan, an internationally renowned artist, gallery
proprietor and the sole owner of livestock in Southampton Village,
has a court date.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors and officials claim that he has violated section
116-9.8 of the village code, which bans ownership of barnyard
animals within village boundaries. Pagan insists that he has found
a loophole in the code that allows people to keep livestock for
pets or meat as long as they own a barn.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has pitted Pagan and the coterie who visit his salon
des artistes _ The Red Bar Atelier _ against his neighbors, the
Gadomskis, a married couple who have lived in the same little house
on Layton Avenue for nearly 50 years. The Spanish-born painter
insists that he is not another out-of-towner with outlandish and
grandiose dreams. Rather, he said, he is a preservationist who is
trying to restore the old character of Southampton; a character
that has been torn down and paved over by a development craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to re-create a colonial feeling here,'' said Pagan, a
quixotic 50-year-old with a shock of curly hair and a goatee. ``The
neighbors, they're an old cranky couple who just don't appreciate
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex and Genevieve Gadomski said they are not cranky people at
all. And as for nature, they grew up on farms in rural Poland.
Their position, they said, is a simple one: Animals are good, just
not in the middle of a subdivision. More than 30 of their neighbors
agree, as does the mayor of Southampton Village, Joseph P.
Romanosky Jr., who happens to be their son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm living with a lot of noise and a lot of smell and I'm a
wreck,'' said Mrs. Gadomski, 79. ``I've lived here a long time and
always thought it was residential. If it's not, then I'm buying a
horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that the problems started as soon as Pagan
purchased the acre of property in 1997. The parcel is said to be
the oldest collection of barns in the village, dating back to the
18th century. Pagan remodeled the buildings in a Mediterranean
style, with an outdoor bread kiln and palazzo, and turned the place
into a nonprofit gallery space and a petting zoo for school
children.
</P>
<P>
   Pagan planted more than 100 trees around the perimeter to
obscure the view of the Gadomskis' plastic fencing, which he
thought was ugly. The trees began to grow over and through the
fencing, dropping pine needles in the elderly woman's garden.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the spring of last year, the first animals were brought
in: crowing roosters, wandering rabbits, flying chickens, baa-ing
sheep. And the uncastrated llama.
</P>
<P>
   When two chickens flew into his yard last year and tore up his
flowers, Mr. Gadomski 80, brought out a pellet gun. A teenager who
was sent by Pagan to retrieve the chickens said the man threatened
to shoot the birds. ``I admit I had the gun,'' Gadomski said. ``But
I wasn't going to shoot anything. I'd like to wring that guy's
neck, but I'd never shoot anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Gadomskis' complaints, the village took Pagan
to court in July 1999, contending that he violated the animal
disturbance law. The case was dismissed with the caveat that Pagan
put his barn in order and keep the animals quiet. He got rid of the
llama. ``He was very aggressive anyway,'' he said. ``He was
spitting on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, Pagan bought three pigs. The list of the
menagerie now read: 20 chickens, 20 ducks, six goats, three pigs,
four sheep, sundry rabbits and guinea hens. At some point, the pigs
dined on the Gadomskis' lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Pagan has been summoned to court again and is scheduled to
appear on Sept. 7. Mayor Romanosky wants all of the animals gone
before then and has instructed the sheriff to fine Pagan $250 every
day the animals remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fascism,'' the Spaniard said. ``It is a total abuse of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Romanosky bristled at the suggestion that he is harassing Pagan
to placate his in-laws. ``It's not as basic as he bought three
little pigs and we're the wolf trying to blow his house in,'' the
mayor said as he was joined in his office by Jonathan Foster, the
village building inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not because it's my in-laws. It's because he's got a
ranch going on over there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a llama!'' blurted the building inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Bowed by the $250 fines for the trespassing chickens, Pagan
clipped their wings. He got rid of everything but the goats and
ducks and chickens. He even reinforced the fencing that surrounds
his property. Still the village and the Gadomskis are determined to
close his barn doors.
</P>
<P>
   In retaliation, Pagan has launched an all-out ``save the farm''
campaign. He has purchased time on the local radio stations to
plead for justice. He has 500 names on a petition (some local, some
not). His supporters routinely call the mayor. He has taken to
hiding his animals behind the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make peace, I tried to meet them half-way,'' Pagan
said while standing in the rain, surveying his hacienda. ``But I'm
ready to go to jail for my animals.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ One has to admire Santa Fe Opera's willingness
to gamble. After all, in an eight-week season offering only five
productions, every questionably bankable show accounts for a
significant portion of the schedule. This summer the company is
staging two high-risk works, the American premiere of Hans Werner
Henze's ``Venus and Adonis'' and Rossini's ``Ermione,'' a rarity
that lay unperformed from its 1819 premiere until its modern
revival in 1987. A third work, Strauss' ``Elektra,'' though not
uncommon, is well down the operatic hit parade.
</P>
<P>
   The Henze and Rossini works have a constituency among opera
obsessives who travel the world in search of fresh works and are
the majority of the Santa Fe audience. And ``Elektra'' draws
admirers of the estimable Strauss tradition established here by
John Crosby, the company's founder and general director. But these
constituencies are not huge: only this season's bread-and-butter
offerings, Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' and Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro,''
are sold out.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Ermione,'' the company enlisted Jonathan Miller to direct,
and he transported the piece from the Trojan War era to the
American South just after the Civil War. It is difficult to imagine
what in this work suggested such a peculiar, historically
incongruous move. Perhaps the idea was picked out of a hat.
</P>
<P>
   In this operatic reduction of Racine's ``Andromaque,'' Pyrrhus,
the Greek ruler of defeated Troy, has resolved to dump his wife,
Hermione (Ermione), in favor of the Trojan princess Andromache,
Hector's widow. She considers the offer only as a way to save her
son Astyanax, the heir to the Trojan throne. Orestes, sent by
Greece to demand Astyanax's execution, mostly pants after Hermione,
who dispatches him to murder Pyrrhus and then excoriates him for
doing so when she has a belated change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   A few trenchant moments are scattered through the
2-and-a-half-hour work, but ``Ermione'' is mostly Rossinian
boilerplate: chirpy tunes with scant connection to the words being
sung, much less the emotions they evoke, and plenty of florid
stuntwork for the soloists. That puts a heavy burden on the
soloists: not only must they have the range and agility to meet the
music's demands, but they must sing thrillingly enough to make the
work's vacuousness seem beside the point. The Santa Fe cast worked
valiantly on Thursday evening, with inconsistent results.
</P>
<P>
   In the title role, Alexandrina Pendatchanska wobbled shrilly
through the first act, but after the intermission she settled into
the role sufficiently to give an admirably ornamented account of
Hermione's final scenes. Barry Banks' Orestes was a bit overwrought
and his timbre veered on reediness. But he has the power and range
for this music, and a taste for bel canto heroics.
</P>
<P>
   There was also much to admire in Sara Mingardo's vocally
dark-hued and dramatically dignified portrayal of Andromache. But
Gregory Kunde was an awkward Pyrrhus, stretched well beyond his
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra, conducted by Evelino Pido, seemed to be having
fun with the music, even after Pido toned it down enough to let the
singers be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Orestes reappears in ``Elektra,'' this time to avenge the death
of his father, Agamemnon, by slaughtering his guilty mother,
Clytemnestra, and her new husband, Aegisthus. The Strauss work,
heard on Friday, is being offered in a strikingly direct production
by Copley. The set, by Bruno Schwengl, is the courtyard of
Aegisthus' palace, littered with fragments of a fallen statue of
Agamemnon.
</P>
<P>
   Schwengl's costumes mirror the spirit of the characters: black
for Elektra, light, muted colors for Chrysothemis, a blaze of red
for Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, and cool blue armor for Orestes.
More crucially, the production has a uniformly strong cast. As
Elektra, Mary Jane Johnson was the picture of madness about to
break loose, but under control for the moment. She was undaunted by
either the acrobatics or the virtually unrelieved intensity of
Strauss' vocal line, and in its best moments, her performance was
hair-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Susan B. Anthony's Chrysothemis was paler dramatically, but she
sang with a power and range that matched Johnson's. Judith Forst
played up Clytemnestra's malevolence and magnified her decrepitude,
but was also equal to the considerable vocal demands of the short
role. And Greer Grimsley's sonorous bass was perfectly suited to
the patiently vengeful Orestes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's championship of the Strauss operas, nearly all of
which have been played here, has its roots in Crosby's fascination
with the composer, and the company's tradition is that when Strauss
is on the stage, Crosby is in the pit. His devotion to this music
and his deep knowledge of it were clearly a motivating force, and
the orchestra responded with the lush string textures, burnished
brass sound and, most important, the carefully modulated tension
that ``Elektra'' requires.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The high, forested mountains of
southeastern Bosnia are a place to hide, and, according to current
local lore, it is there, in the steep gorges or trails and high
passes into neighboring Montenegro, that Radovan Karadzic has been
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic, the former leader of the Bosnian Serbs twice indicted
by the Hague war crimes tribunal on charges of genocide and crimes
against humanity, took refuge, according to media reports in Bosnia
last month, in the village of Celebici, right on the border with
his native Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   A onetime psychiatrist who led a campaign of extreme nationalism
and instigated a lethal war of ethnic cleansing, he has been
closely guarded since the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   Even men who were once his close associates say they have not
seen him for two years. His influence over the Bosnian Serb
republic, which he founded, is said to be waning, as officials
close to him have been moved out of office, left the country or
been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Karadzic, widely regarded as the man most culpable for the
1992-95 war in Bosnia, is still at large.
</P>
<P>
   His unrepentant presence glowers over every issue in this ruined
society: The return of displaced people to their homes, the rule of
law, cooperation of local officials and politicians with the
international administration, and the failure or unwillingness of
the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia, known as SFOR, to arrest
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me he is the central one,'' said Thomas Miller, the U.S.
ambassador in Bosnia, who insists that arresting Karadzic is still
a priority. ``For my government, if I had one single wish, it would
be to get Karadzic. He's a war criminal, responsible for terrible
things, but to his people he symbolizes resistance. If he goes, it
collapses that wall of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Karadzic has eluded the special squads who have steadily
picked up lesser suspects _ almost one a month in the last 10
months _ and he has continued to move around the region, if with
great caution and even more warily since NATO troops seized his
close associate and partner in war, Momcilo Krajisnik, in April.
</P>
<P>
   It is five years since Karadzic was indicted, and local
journalists and officials fear that despite all foreign promises,
he may get away for good, sneaking into Montenegro and then Serbia,
where many other war crimes suspects have found refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Georgios Vlachogiannis, the international governor of Foca, the
Serbian nationalist stronghold closest to Celebici, said he did not
believe that Karadzic was still in the area. ``There are rumors
that he is moving through the Montenegrin border,'' he said. ``Some
think he is moving into Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pale, the ski resort town outside Sarajevo that Karadzic made
his capital and wartime headquarters, his daughter has reportedly
been looking for a buyer for her television and radio station,
Astra. That could indicate that the family is preparing to move to
Serbia, one local journalist said. Karadzic's son, a businessman
reputed to have ties to the widespread smuggling networks developed
during the war, has lived in Belgrade for some years.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic's wife, Ljiljana Karadzic, still heads the Red Cross in
the Bosnian Serb republic and in July attended the celebrations in
Pale marking the 10th anniversary of the founding of her husband's
Serbian Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   She appears to live apart from her husband for security reasons
but remains a standard bearer and praised the achievements of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Karadzic in Pale remains outwardly strong.
``Everyone still supports him,'' said a 24-year-old who gave only
his first name, Mladan. ``I think no one would betray him, despite
the big reward. If he were arrested, blood would be spilled and
there would be attacks on SFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   But others doubt that there would be unrest, pointing to the
muted reaction after the arrest of Krajisnik. ``People are only
interested in jobs,'' said Mayor Dragoljub Pipovic of Foca, a Serb.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The governor, Vlachogiannis, says the thugs who made Foca
notorious _ 12 men from Foca alone have been indicted on war crimes
charges _ have gone and the atmosphere in the town has changed.
``My feeling is that after Krajisnik's arrest they left,'' he said.
``They are probably living in Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why NATO peacekeepers would not arrest indicted war crimes
suspects before they crossed the border, a spokesman for the force,
Col. Tom Beginnes, said that it was not the force's task to pursue
suspects and that they could be arrested only when encountered in
the course of peacekeeping activities.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic's top general, Ratko Mladic, has been living in
Belgrade since the end of the Bosnian war and has been sighted
there several times in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Serbia may not provide a safe refuge for some men _ as
Dragan Nikolic, a Serb wanted by the Hague tribunal for crimes
alleged to have been committed in a camp for Muslims near Vlasenica
in 1992, found out. Nikolic, the first man indicted by the war
crimes tribunal, was abducted from his home in the town of
Smederevo in central Serbia in April, driven to the border with
Bosnia in the trunk of a car and handed over to U.S. troops. His
abduction is said to have been organized by Serbian bounty hunters
tempted by the cash reward, who have since been arrested in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has posted a $5 million reward for
information leading to the arrest of the three most notorious men
indicted by the tribunal, Karadzic, Mladic and President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia, who was charged for crimes committed by
his troops in the Kosovo war last year.
</P>
<P>
   If the reward has not brought any results so far, it has
certainly raised the stakes. Wolfgang Petritsch, who heads the
international administration in Bosnia, said the steady stream of
arrests had increased the pressure. ``The big shots are still at
large,'' he said, ``but I can feel a heightened sense of
nervousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic has gone to extreme lengths to protect himself. He
never shows his face, but people know he is in Pale when they see
members of his entourage around, one journalist in the town said.
That last happened two to three months ago, the journalist added.
Former associates say Karadzic went underground two years ago after
the murder of the young deputy police chief, Srdjan Knezevic, in
Pale in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic is widely believed to have been behind the killing,
since the influential deputy had defected to join Biljana Plavsic,
then president of the Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
   Plavsic, once an extreme nationalist, turned her back on
Karadzic and threw in her lot with the Western officials running
Bosnia before losing the presidency in late 1998. She reacted by
withdrawing Karadzic's government bodyguards, according to his
former defense minister, Milan Ninkovic.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few close associates of Karadzic still openly in
circulation in Bosnia, Ninkovic remains the most powerful
politician in his hometown of Doboj in the north of the country.
Yet the threat of a secret indictment clearly nagged at him. He
complained that peacekeepers' helicopters had started flying over
his house on the outskirts of Doboj.
</P>
<P>
   ``They often fly over the house and hover, and there is some
indication that they are photographing my house,'' he said. ``I
consider that there is no war crime in my past and the only problem
is that I am an obstacle to my political enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   He served as defense minister for the last year of the war in
Bosnia, and so was in office during the worst massacre of the war,
at Srebrenica. He insists that he had little authority and that
Karadzic and Mladic frequently bypassed him when they issued orders
to the army.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed Mladic, with whom he had frequent disagreements, for
Srebrenica. He was careful in his comments about Karadzic, saying
the only order he had seen was for the army to surround Srebrenica,
not seize it.
</P>
<P>
   Ninkovic, like Karadzic, defends the actions of the Bosnian Serb
leadership during the war. An interview with him runs like a speech
in his defense, and one that takes little account of the recent
arrests and indictments of some of the most notorious Bosnian Croat
war crimes suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only mistake was that I wanted to defend my own people,''
Ninkovic said, accusing the Muslim side of war crimes too. ``Who
killed the 30,000 Serb war dead?'' he asked. ``Yet it is only Serbs
who go to the Hague.''

OFF THE TOP SHELF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   __ The book: ``All Things Possible: My Story of Faith, Football
and the Miracle Season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The author: St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, with
Sports Illustrated writer Michael Silver.
</P>
<P>
   __ The essential info: $24; HarperSan Francisco; 269 pgs.
</P>
<P>
   __ The real-life message: Inspirational on many levels, Warner's
story goes well past Hollywood-scripted tripe often passed off as
``Field of Dreams'' material. This reads, and feels, more real.
</P>
<P>
   What he calls ``one of the wildest slingshot rides you'll ever
see in sports or anywhere else'' _ specifically, ending up as the
MVP of the Super Bowl after working his way up from the bottom _
seems even more improbable. As he tells it, starting with his
childhood bedwetting problems and broken home, moving along to
marrying single-mom Brenda and stocking shelves at the supermarket,
it's still stuff that's already been chronicled, but it all seems
richer as he adds his humor and personal anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he writes about trying to avoid the trappings of
success: ``A few years ago, we were eating ramen noodles and peanut
butter-and-jelly sandwiches for dinner, and now that we can go out
to a restaurant and afford to buy anything on the menu, a lot of
times they won't even bring us a check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to roll my eyes at the special treatment we
receive. People who wouldn't give us the time of day . . . now act
like we're the best thing since squeezable ketchup bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The religion angle: It's an important part of his life, but
he explains how: ``A lot of people are turned off when athletes
talk like this, so let me come right out and clarify my position:
I'm not trying to preach or be overly judgmental, and I'm not in
any way claiming that God is some sort of football grand pooh-bah
who hands out touchdowns and sacks to the faithful like winning
lottery tickets. I'm just trying to give people a sense of what
works for me. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Amen to that.

 &HT;    Falcon's preseason victories make for tough decisions
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Atlanta Falcons discovered in Tokyo that they have
problems _ good problems.
</P>
<P>
   Players are making it very difficult to decide who will stay and
who will go.
</P>
<P>
   The two preseason victories have shown that competition is
intense at the wide receiver, running back and secondary positions.
And four-year veteran quarterback Tony Graziani muddled the
quarterback race with a solid performance in Saturday's 20-9
victory against Dallas in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be a good football team, you're going to
have to turn some good football players out on the street,'' vice
president/football operations Ron Hill said. ``Competition makes
everybody better because people push each other and improve faster
working against better players.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves has made it clear that rookie free agent
quarterback Doug Johnson stands a good chance of staying as a
developmental project. In limited action against Dallas, Johnson
didn't lose any ground, completing three of four passes for 44
yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Graziani was the story.
</P>
<P>
   Despite speculation that he has little chance in competition
with Danny Kanell for the backup spot, Graziani, a seventh-round
draft choice in 1997, completed nine of 14 passes for 134 yards and
two touchdowns. He threw touchdown passes to 6-foot-5 wide receiver
Brian Finneran, who's pressing for a permanent job, and rookie free
agent Maurice Smith, who also is opening eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell completed nine of 15 passes, including touchdowns to
Finneran and tight end Brian Kozlowski, during last week's victory
against Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was skeptical about Tony going to Barcelona (to play in NFL
Europe) instead of staying here in our offseason program, and
working with the new guys,'' Reeves said. ``But he got to play a
lot, and that's really what he needed more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson, whose comeback from right knee surgery should
continue with his first preseason action Friday at home against the
Bengals, isn't the only issue at running back. Smith, who gained 24
yards on eight carries against Dallas, Ron Rivers, Byron Hanspard,
Gary Downs, Ken Oxendine and Winslow Oliver are competing for two
or three running back spots.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams will be a very important consideration for reserve
running backs, and Downs and Oliver, who have not carried the ball
in in the preseason, are valuable there.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith and Rivers (nine carries for 25 yards) have run well
in the past two games. Oxendine also had a strong performance
against the Cowboys with 53 yards on 16 carries. Smith lost a
fumble, but also caused one on a Dallas kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   At wide receiver, Terance Mathis, Tim Dwight and Shawn Jefferson
are locks. Finneran, who had three receptions for 36 yards, Eugene
Baker, who had two catches for 45 yards, Jammi German (20-yard
reception) and special teams ace Ronnie Harris (three for 34) are
vying for two or three spots.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran had a 41-yard reception called back.

ROTATION' REVOLVING DOOR OPENS FOR EX-WAVE WISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Matt Wise will become the 12th pitcher to start a
game for the Anaheim Angels when he faces the Red Sox at Edison
Field on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wise's opportunity, as for many of the others, has come as a
result of injuries to other starters. Wise, who went to Bonita
High, Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton, is getting his chance
because Seth Etherton has tendinitis in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Wise went 9-6 with a 3.69 ERA, two complete games and one
shutout in 19 starts for Triple-A Edmonton this season. He was
called up Wednesday when reliever Al Levine got hurt. And after a
few days in the bullpen, he learned he'd be making his first
major-league start this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a surprise, ever since I was called up,'' said Wise,
who is 6-foot-4, 190 pounds. ``When they told me I was starting
Wednesday, it caught me off guard. But I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who lives in LaVerne, was part of a rotation at Double-A
Erie last season that included Etherton, Ramon Ortiz and Brian
Cooper. They made it to the big leagues without him, but he says he
understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of stuff to work on,'' he said. ``Plus, I had
(elbow) surgery last year. I wanted to take advantage of the
opportunity to pitch there (Edmonton). I was happy for those guys.
But I wanted to make sure I was ready before I came up here. I
still have things to work on, but I feel I'm close enough to do
good.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No payback: Scioscia defended his players' decision not to
retaliate against the Indians' Manny Ramirez for a spikes-high
slide into catcher Matt Walbeck on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's spikes cut Walbeck's thigh, and the Angels thought the
play was dirty. But when Ramirez batted again one inning later with
first base open and two outs, pitcher Scott Schoeneweis didn't
brush back Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the game hard and we play the game clean,'' Scioscia
said. They got the message we weren't happy with the slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time we've seen something like that with
(Ramirez). It would be different if a player habitually does it.
And even so, it doesn't necessarily mean we'd put a ball in his
neck. There are different ways of handling things. Messages can be
sent in different forms.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Washburn activated: Pitcher Jarrod Washburn will be activated
today and start against the Red Sox at Edison Field. Washburn (6-2,
3.87 ERA) has been on the disabled list since July 22 with a sore
left biceps.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will have to make room for Washburn on the roster and
are expected to demote reserve outfielder Edgard Clemente. Clemente
is out of options and would have to clear waivers before being
assigned to the minors. There is a good chance another team would
claim him.

RED SOX IN A CYBERSERIES? GET SERIOUS

<P>
   __ The game: World Series Baseball 2K1, featuring Boston Red Sox
pitcher Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   __ The essential info: By Sega, for Sega Dreamcast, suggested
price: $49.95, rated E (for everyone). This is the first baseball
game made for Dreamcast since the platform was introduced last
September.
</P>
<P>
   __ The pros: Easy to control with five levels of play (amateur,
rookie, veteran, All Star and legend); excellent job incorporating
real player faces onto the cyberbodies with more than 1,500
motion-captured animations, especially with batting and running
motion.
</P>
<P>
   __ The cons: Each defensive play looks anything but fluid, crowd
noises are annoying, and the game announcer is more stiff than
Geoff Witcher in real life.
</P>
<P>
   __ The commercial: Might be the best part of the package right
now. It's with cover boy Pedro Martinez lovingly talking about
``his kids'' and then changing his tune, describing how he'll beat
them at the game because he has ``more pitches than a used-car
salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Keep in mind: It uses rosters that all 30 teams had at the
beginning of the 2000 season, so it's already kind of outdated,
only because of all the trading.
</P>
<P>
   __ A reason to doubt its realism: In a Dodgers-Mets game we
played, Carlos Perez got out of the first inning without giving up
a run.

CNN.COM RESTORES JERUSALEM TO ISRAEL  
 LEWINSKY INTERVIEW DID HAVE ITS COSTS  
 `BIG BROTHER' HOST SEEKING CREDIBILITY  

</HEADLINE>
   By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In February, executives at CNN.com made a change to their
weather home page that at the time, they said, seemed innocent
enough. On a list of cities that allows users to click on a heading
to get weather reports around the world, they moved Jerusalem out
from under the heading of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Users, who once would have found Jerusalem listed with other
cities in Israel, now found it standing alone.
</P>
<P>
   The executives made the move, they said last week, in keeping
with their editorial position that Jerusalem is a disputed
territory and that to list it as part of Israel would portray
CNN.com as taking sides in the debate. ``CNN is a news-gathering
organization. It does not take editorial stances,'' said Edna
Johnson, a spokeswoman for CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   But CNN.com changed its stance last week, after it received an
angry letter from Phil Baum, executive director of the American
Jewish Congress, who wrote that it was exercising ``politically
biased news judgment that Jerusalem is now an international city.''
He demanded that the network change its Web site and put Jerusalem
back under Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Baum's letter was followed by a flood of phone
calls and e-mail messages making the same demand. ``They saw it as
a political statement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After some internal discussion, CNN changed its Web site again
on Thursday, and listed the city as Jerusalem, Israel, once again.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that while the executives at CNN, a unit of Time
Warner, were reacting to the political accusations when they made
the change, they were also, in part, considering complaints from
users who said that by moving Jerusalem out of the Israel section,
they had made it hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives have not caved in altogether. The CNN.com
weather listing for Jerusalem is marked with an asterisk, which
leads users to the following message: ``The status of Jerusalem,
the seat of Israeli government, is the most contentious issue in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Palestinian and Arab leaders
consider part of Jerusalem the capital of the prospective
Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky Interview Did Have Its Costs
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, ABC News struck gold: Monica Lewinsky, after
flirting with other news organizations, agreed to give her first
interview to Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing the coup, Walters and ABC News repeatedly
stated that they had not paid Lewinsky for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that the interview did not cost ABC News.
The organization paid Theodore Olson, a Washington lawyer, to help
it ``secure access to Lewinsky,'' says a profile of David Westin,
the ABC News president, in the issue of The New Yorker that is out
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ABC needed help from the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. The
interview with Lewinsky was delayed for months because of
Lewinsky's immunity agreement with the prosecutor. It required
Lewinsky to get permission from Starr before giving any interviews.
Starr had been withholding that permission.
</P>
<P>
   Starr gave his blessing to the interview in February 1999. The
article does not establish whether Starr gave his permission
because of any efforts by Olson, whom the article describes as a
friend of the prosecutor. Westin told the magazine that the
arrangement did not violate the network's policy against paying for
interviews, since the money was paid to a lawyer, not to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday an ABC spokeswoman said Olson was hired for his
``specialized knowledge and expertise in immunity agreements'' and
took issue with what she called the implication that ABC was paying
for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker article had been widely anticipated among
executives at all of the major news organizations. In part, that
may be because it has been a slow summer in terms of news (yep,
that includes the convention), and an even slower one in terms of
grist for the network chattering classes.
</P>
<P>
   `Big Brother' Host Seeking Credibility
</P>
<P>
   CBS' announcement earlier this summer that Julie Chen, the news
reader on ``The Early Show,'' would be a host on ``Big Brother,''
one of the network's two summer reality programs, sent ripples of
anger through the network's news division.
</P>
<P>
   There was grumbling that it was inappropriate for a news
personality like Chen to participate in ``Big Brother,'' a
prime-time game show that is managed by CBS Entertainment. Her
appointment to the program kicked off a renewed debate over whether
the lines between network news and entertainment were becoming
blurred. Andy Rooney, the ``60 Minutes'' commentator, publicly
called her role in the program ``a further deterioration of news
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, executives close to the program say, Chen is doing what she
can to maintain her stature as a newscaster, heatedly fighting with
``Big Brother'' script writers, who have been handing her lines
that are hardly the stuff of network news people.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after the first episode of ``Big Brother,'' Chen
was heavily criticized by TV critics for uttering the following
decidedly un-newsy statement: ``Wow. That was intense.'' Earlier,
Chen had told the audience, ``Wow, that's wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the lines seemed to have been ad-libbed by Chen,
executives revealed that the words were scripted. Chen, they said,
was deeply embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, they said, she has been engaging in long, tense
arguments about scripts with her ``Big Brother'' producer, Michael
Horowicz, over lines that she thinks will sully her image. Though
Chen is said to have won some battles _ knocking out the more
embarrassing lines _ she has only been able to do so much, and some
have remained from week to week.
</P>
<P>
   Chen and Horowicz both declined to comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' runs on CBS six nights a week and made its debut
in July, when 10 contestants were placed in a house together and
put under constant surveillance. Once a week the contestants
nominate one another for elimination or the audience votes one of
them out. Chen is the host of the weekly shows and she interviews
contestants about the week's developments.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said that to give Chen more time for those
interviews, in which she can act more like a newscaster, they have
eliminated the role of the co-host, Ian O'Malley.

GORE AND ADVISERS GATHER TO SELECT A RUNNING MATE
</HEADLINE>
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ With just hours to go until his self-imposed
deadline of noon on Tuesday, Vice President Al Gore huddled with
close aides and family members Sunday night to make his decision on
a vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation continued to center on four Democrats in the Senate
_ John Kerry of Massachusetts, John Edwards of North Carolina,
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Evan Bayh of Indiana _ although
Gore raised the possibility last week that he might pick a ``wild
card.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president met here Sunday afternoon with Warren
Christopher, the head of his vice presidential search committee, to
discuss his choices. Also in the meeting were Gore's wife, Tipper;
his brother-in-law, Frank Hunger; William Daley, his campaign
chairman; and Donna Brazile, his campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   At every opportunity Sunday, Gore said he had not made a
decision. ``I have not decided yet,'' he said at an afternoon
fund-raiser in New York. ``But I will, and shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley appeared on several talk shows Sunday morning, determined
not to tip Gore's hand but he did discuss how the campaign might
respond to concerns that have been raised about each of the
possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Edwards' tenure of just a year and a half in the
Senate showed sufficient experience, Daley noted on CNN's ``Late
Edition'' that Abraham Lincoln had served only one term in Congress
before he became president.
</P>
<P>
   Of Kerry, whom some Republicans have branded a Massachusetts
liberal in the Kennedy tradition, Daley said he was a patriot and a
decorated Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Of criticism from abortion-rights groups that Bayh was not
committed enough to abortion rights, Daley said that Bayh's record
as a former governor of Indiana showed his leadership and that his
position on abortion would not disqualify him from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the country was ready for a Jewish president _
referring to Lieberman _ Daley acknowledged that some people might
have a problem with that, but he noted that several states have
elected Jewish senators.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rendell, chairman of the Democratic Party and former mayor of
Philadelphia, told reporters on Saturday, ``I don't think anyone
can calculate the effect of having a Jew on the ticket.'' Rendell
is Jewish, but his comments drew criticism Sunday from Jewish
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Diament, political director of the Union of Orthodox
Jewish Congregations of America, said that Rendell was giving
legitimacy to ``whatever anti-Semitic views are out there.''
Diament said he was worried that commentary on Lieberman, whose
Orthodox faith precludes certain activities on Saturdays, was
``feeding a perception that Sabbath-observant people aren't capable
of doing certain jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, speculation centered as much on when the selection might
be leaked to the news media as much as it did on whom the candidate
might be.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, said, ``There is no firm
timetable, but it's unlikely that any phone calls will take place
until later on on Monday or early Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that the process was being run in the manner that
Gore had insisted upon. ``We haven't engaged in soliciting
Democrats by sending out questionnaires, we haven't held a series
of press conferences with possible candidates, and you haven't had
a range of names put out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, who has been helping Gore in the selection process,
said Sunday afternoon that he thought Gore had conducted his search
in ``a professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not brought up any names publicly, but officials close
to the campaign have confirmed a list of six. Besides the four
senators, the list included Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire
and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, both of whom
have said they are not interested.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whom Gore may pick for his running mate has
dominated political talk here and wherever Gore appeared over the
weekend. When he arrived in Nashville from New York on Sunday
afternoon, his hotel was swamped with camera crews and reporters,
and Gore tried to turn the focus of attention from speculation on
his running mate to his campaign themes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore began the day at a church service in Sag Harbor, N.Y., on
the east end of Long Island. He had asked to speak to honor the
35th anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
which gave the federal government the authority to oversee voter
registration and elections in counties that had used literacy tests
and other unconstitutional means to determine voter eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion allowed Gore to reflect on his, and his father's,
support for civil rights, although, as a U.S. senator from
Tennessee, his father, Albert Gore Sr., had voted against the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also showcased more of his biography, a goal that is
becoming more urgent as he heads toward the Democratic National
Convention next week in Los Angeles, where his advisers hope he can
make the most of his chance to re-introduce himself to voters.
</P>
<P>
   He used the spotlight over the weekend to appeal to the base of
his party, including blacks and liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Sunday from the pulpit of Christ Episcopal Church,
beneath a revolving fan on the arched wooden ceiling, Gore said
that the congregation of about 70 people, who included several
African-Americans, ``looks like America.''

KELLY SAYS HE'S STAYING TWO MORE SEASONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Sophomore wide receiver Kareem Kelly wrapped up
summer school a day early and will unexpectedly join his teammates
today when USC opens training camp at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more important for the Trojans, Kelly has already
decided he will not turn pro after this season, no matter how
successfully he might follow up last season, when he was named the
Pacific-10 Conference Freshman of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NFL teams call out at me, I'll turn them down,'' Kelly
said Sunday. ``I want to make it at least until my junior year. I
still have a lot to learn. It's evident that I always get better
every year. But coming out after my sophomore year is too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's announcement means he and sophomore quarterback Carson
Palmer have publicly stated they will both stay at USC for at least
two more years. Kelly said if Palmer turns pro following the 2001
season, he would most likely also leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who caught 54 passes for 904 yards and four touchdowns
last year, said he will be used in a more unconventional manner
this season, in part because teams will probably double-team him
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan a lot of trickery and I'll even be in the backfield a
little,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   __ High expectations: Beginning with Saturday's first team
meeting, it's evident USC enters the year with higher expectations
than any season since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team last night, in all my years of coaching, I
don't know if I've ever been more excited about a group,'' USC
coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is the Orange Bowl, but we'll settle for the Rose
Bowl,'' quarterback Carson Palmer said, referring to the national
championship game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   __ Freshmen report: Hackett said strong safety Matt Grootegoed
and offensive tackle Joe McGuire stood out in the freshmen-only
practices held on campus this week. He also singled out wide
receiver Keary Colbert, quarterback Matt Cassel and tight ends Alex
Holmes and Gregg Guenther.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the surprise would be (defensive lineman) Jamaal
Williams,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Position switch: Sophomore Scott Huber, who switched from
tight end to linebacker last spring, has decided to move back to
tight end.

 &HT;    LAWSUITS TARGET MINE INSPECTOR(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By CRAIG HARRIS(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Arizona State Mine Inspector's Office received just one
anonymous complaint in five years about unsafe conditions at
Asarco's Mission underground copper mine, but the family of Jose
Villanueva blames state officials for the January accident that
took his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want $10 million from the state and say they will sue
if the state won't pay.
</P>
<P>
   A suit in the Villanueva death would be the latest in a string
of court battles for the small agency that was created by the
Constitution that accompanied statehood in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Since settling a wrongful-death suit in 1998 for $90,000, the
mine inspector's office lost a trial in April, after a person died
from a fall into an abandoned mine shaft near Payson. The jury
awarded $811,576 in damages after a trial in which the Mine
Inspector's Office alleged the victim had been drinking at the time
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Another mining wrongful-death case from 1997 is scheduled for
trial this week in Pima County Superior Court in Tucson. In
addition, Mine Inspector Doug Martin, who was elected in 1988 but
had avoided suits until the past few years, faces another
wrongful-death suit involving a concrete facility in Huachuca and a
personal-injury suit from a mine in Morenci.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the jury award and settlement, Martin believes the
lawsuits are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me think I have some people out there who want
monetary compensation, and they don't care where it comes from,''
Martin said. ``They want it from any source they can. {hellip} What
can I say? It is a litigious society.''
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona loses a mining case or agrees to a pretrial
settlement, the money comes from the state's risk management fund.
That money, of course, comes from taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Millea, the Phoenix attorney representing the Villanueva
family, said those victimized by mining accidents have no one to
sue but the state Mine Inspector's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Millea said Arizona's workers' compensation laws make it nearly
impossibly to sue an employer unless an accident victim can prove
willful misconduct. He also said federal laws make it difficult to
sue the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, the other
government agency responsible for protecting miners.
</P>
<P>
   The Villanueva family contends that the state Mine Inspector's
Office is responsible for Jose Villanueva's death because it acted
in a ``grossly negligent manner'' as it inspected and regulated the
mine, which is 18 miles south of Tucson in the community of
Sahuarita. Millea contends that if the state had done its job,
inspectors would have seen the same kind of unsafe mining
conditions that killed Villanueva.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if it truly was an unavoidable accident, but
this is not what happened here,'' Millea said. ``It's sad when you
see how this guy (Villanueva) was so concerned about his safety,
and that is why his family is so angry. And that is why we are
going to ask the state for a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva was killed Jan. 31, when a 9-ton slab of copper ore
fell on his crane while he and two partners were loading explosives
into the roof of a cave. He fell at least 20 feet to his death,
while Joe Olson and Javier Vargas were severely injured.
Investigative reports from Martin's office and the federal mine
safety agency said Villanueva and Olson's failure to properly
secure their safety belts contributed to the accident's severity.
</P>
<P>
   During the entire 13 months Villanueva worked at the mine,
neither he nor anyone from his family complained to the state,
according to Phil Howard, assistant mine inspector. In fact, no one
had complained to the state about the mine since 1996, when a
person anonymously complained about poor ventilation and unsafe
work conditions. A state report found those complaints were
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Villanuevas had not called the state mining office
to complain about conditions at the Mission mine, Millea said,
``I'm not sure they understood exactly how mines are regulated.''
He said Jose, his wife and their two youngest children had moved to
Arizona from New Mexico about a year before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Then Millea added, ``I can tell you it is my impression that
miners don't think the Arizona mine inspector does anything. They
report (problems) to the federal agency because they thought they
were more likely to get results.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, Villanueva's widow, Amparo, has received a
$5,000 burial benefit and roughly two-thirds of his salary from
Asarco's insurance carrier, both of which are required under state
workers' compensation laws. The insurer also has covered all the
medical costs for Olson and Vargas and has paid them nearly
two-thirds of their salary as they recover from severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But in each case, the miner or his family is receiving
approximately $200 less every two weeks because the state caps
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is pretty good if you are the employer, but not too
good if you are the employee,'' said Olson, who said he felt boxed
in by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona allows a worker to sue an employer for an on-the-job
accident only if the employee files written notice rejecting
workers' compensation. The notice must be filed before the employee
suffers an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is rarely done and very few people opt out ahead of
time,'' said Brian I. Clymer, a Tucson attorney who wrote a
handbook on the state's workers' compensation system.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Industrial Commission does not keep records as to how
many of the state's 2.36 million workers opt out of the coverage
and therefore retain the option to sue their employer.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas said he had no idea he couldn't sue Asarco now that he
has accepted worker's compensation.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, Tucson attorney Patrick Butler filed notices of
claim against the state for both Vargas and Olson. Butler claimed
that competent state inspections would have revealed ``that the
mine consistently employed mining methods which resulted in
unnecessary exposure of miners to unstable ground conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The notice of claim for Olson and his wife demands $2.5 million,
claiming that in the accident he suffered a spinal cord injury,
nerve damage and fractures to his sternum, left wrist and left
elbow, as well as four fractured ribs. The claim for Vargas and his
five children demands $3.5 million for injuries to his legs so
severe that he lost several inches of one leg and ``will continue
to require assistance and care.''
</P>
<P>
   Millea said the Villanueva family might sue the federal Mine
Safety and Health Administration if there is proof federal
inspectors failed to investigate safety complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona's workers' compensation laws are not all that
different than the rest of the country, said Cheye Calvo, who
studies the issue for the bipartisan National Conference of State
Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a trade-off and in most states it benefits employees,''
Calvo said. ``You could go to court, wait five years and not get a
dime. But (under workers' compensation) if you are injured, it will
take care of you Day One and you are compensated for lost wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvo also said every state but Texas has a mandatory workers'
compensation system.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, workers' compensation language was written into the
1912 state Constitution at the urging of an attorney who
represented the railroads and Phelps Dodge, a major mining company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, voters changed the Constitution to require an injured
worker to take workers' compensation benefits unless it's rejected
prior to an accident. In 1980, voters changed the law again by
giving co-workers immunity from lawsuits. And language was added to
protect employers from suits unless they ``knowingly and
purposely'' injured workers or engage in a ``willful disregard of
life,'' according to Clymer.
</P>
<P>
   Now with all the suits filed against his office, Martin plans to
ask the 2001 Legislature to give his office absolute immunity from
suits. An effort this year to get the office partial immunity
failed.

Beard's first name) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With dolphin-like swiftness and ease,
12-year-old Dana Vollmer has propelled herself from Granbury's
summer swimming league to a shot at the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Amid 1996 Olympic gold-medalists Jenny Thompson, Beth Botsford
and Amanda Beard, all of whom will converge on Indianapolis for
this week's U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, Dana is rapidly revealing
herself as a rising star. Sporting a lean frame of nearly 5-foot-9,
she is sharp, focused and bursting with talent.
</P>
<P>
   She regards Thompson, a two-time Olympian, as her ultimate hero
_ Thompson is the world record-holder in Vollmer's top event _ yet
her path to this point mirrors Botsford and Beard. Those two, both
sophomores at Arizona, rocketed onto the Olympic scene in Atlanta.
Beard was 14; Botsford was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dana has a chance to eclipse that when she takes the water
Wednesday in the 100-meter butterfly, though she is more likely a
serious contender for the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try really not to think about it because I get myself worked
up and nervous before the meet,'' Dana said Friday morning after
completing her final practice session at the Forest Park pool.
</P>
<P>
   A family play day at Hurricane Harbor was up next, only two days
before her scheduled arrival in America's heartland and braving a
new world: elite Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic-caliber swimming is unlike gymnastics or figure skating,
where younger often means better. Adolescent swimmers face an
upstream battle against fully developed athletes who have been
training and competing at a world-class level around the calendar
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Botsford and Beard were, Dana appears to be a prodigy
in the making. Until recently, Dana didn't register a blip on the
selective radar of the Fort Worth Area Swim Team (FAST), an
extension of USA Swimming and a year-round elite swim club. That is
a major difference from her youthful predecessors, who began
year-round training years before making the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Dana, remarkably, joined FAST only last September. Her parents,
Les and Cathy, a longtime swim coach who has tutored her daughter
for years, chose to forgo the life-changing commitment of full-time
training for a couple of reasons. The drive to Fort Worth and the
nearest Olympic-sized pool is 50 minutes from the Vollmers in
Granbury, but the drive was only part of the reason they didn't
make the trip regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coaching a long time, and I've seen a lot of young
kids that were really good get burned out really early and then
they quit,'' Cathy said. ``As soon as you switch over to full time,
it's full time from now until after college, and that's a lot. You
do have to keep reminding yourself that she's just 12, that she
needs to be a kid and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the switch to full-time training _ about 11 practices a
week for two-hour sessions twice a day, starting at 5:30 a.m.
coming up in the fall _ has come as naturally to Dana as the
butterfly stroke she started to perfect at age 5 when mom toted her
around in a backpack when she coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been people really good at 12, but not at the level
she is,'' said Ted Murphy of FAST, Dana's instructor since joining
the club. ``She is basically one-in-a-million. She is swimming in
senior national events. The top 1 percent of all swimmers are in
those meets.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof is in her times. In the past six months, Dana has set
three national age-group records in the butterfly. Two of those
records, the 50-yard and 50-meter butterfly had belonged to
Botsford, set in 1993. Dana's third record, in the 100-meter
butterfly, blasted an 18-year-old mark set by Jennifer Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Dana is so advanced that she doesn't swim against competitors
close to her own age. Instead, she is routinely blowing away
college-age swimmers at high-level meets.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dana: ``I don't think they really realize \Rmy age\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana's 100-meter national butterfly record of 1:03.07, set July
15 at the Junior National Southeast meet in Orlando, Fla.,
qualified her for the Olympic trials by two-hundredths of a second.
It is about four to five seconds off the pace she probably will
need to make the Olympic team, which carries two swimmers in each
event.
</P>
<P>
   She has two primary goals this week. Making the Olympic team is
the ultimate. On a more realistic level, Dana said she wants to
make the semifinals, which would put her in the top 16. Also, a
time of 1:02.21 would automatically place her on the U.S. National
Junior team, a squad that competes internationally and is the next
logical step on the road to the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Her rapid rise hardly seems to affect Dana, who will soon have
to make some athletic choices. This month, she will enter seventh
grade, the first year students can participate in scholastic
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play volleyball, basketball and track,'' she said.
``Right now, it sounds kind of weird, but I love basketball as much
as I love swimming. I hear things like, `But you're going to the
Olympic trials.' I've always dreamed of playing in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Calm and mature, the significance of her supersonic success and
a blazing bright future might be more incomprehensible right now
for Dana's parents than for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of ignoring it because it could be so big that it
would overwhelm me and therefore influence her,'' Les Vollmer said.
``This trip to Indianapolis, we are trying to find a bunch of
things to do, call it a vacation, and, oh by the way, on Wednesday
you're going to swim for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.'' nn

<P>
   NORMAL, Ill. _ In stump speeches that echoed his combative
address to the Republican National Convention, Dick Cheney on
Sunday repeated his promise of a ``tough fight'' to ``restore
honor, integrity and decency to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he acknowledged in an interview that House
Republicans bore some responsibility for the ``partisan bickering
and backbiting'' in Washington that he rails against in his
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't deny it has been a two-way street,'' said Cheney, the
Republican vice presidential nominee, on the third day of a rail
trip across middle America with Gov. George W. Bush. ``The process
by which we Republicans took control in '94 left some scar
tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, the second-ranking House Republican until he became
defense secretary under President George Bush, also denied waging a
specific offensive against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've attacked President Clinton at this
stage,'' he said. ``We've made it clear what we want to bring to
the White House. If it implies any criticism of the Clinton
administration, that's their problem, not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the lower-key style of Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois was more in sync with Bush's ``compassionate
conservatism'' than the scorched-earth tactics of former Speaker
Newt Gingrich, a friend of Cheney, were. ``Denny Hastert is
probably more suited to the kind of thing we're talking about now
than Newt,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, of course, is a name that most Republicans are running
away from these days. There is little mention of the hard-edged
politics of confrontation that predated Bush. And Cheney fits that
mold of the conservative pragmatist who brings the campaign depth
in foreign affairs and the business world.
</P>
<P>
   In his speeches, Bush describes his 59-year-old running mate as
``humble,'' ``strong,'' ``steady,'' and someone who has brought
``nobility to public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their rail tour, Cheney has stuck to his role as the
solid, substantive but colorless understudy, the intellectual
ballast who would never upstage the top of the ticket. And that is
how Bush wants it, his aides say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what's involved is to get reoriented back into the
political world,'' said Cheney, who until two weeks ago was
chairman of Halliburton Co., the big oil services company. ``All of
this has happened so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace is about to get even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking tradition with the role of previous vice presidents,
who typically were dispatched to shore up their voter base, Cheney
said he would spend most of the campaign in key battleground states
that will be decisive in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Republicans are so united, we have the freedom to send
him to swing states,'' said Karen P. Hughes, Bush's communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush will campaign in California and the Pacific Northwest
later this week with his former rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
Cheney will hit the stump on his own in Missouri, Michigan, Ohio,
Kentucky and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   To cover as much electoral ground as possible in the next three
months, the two running mates will run apart, with Cheney saying he
would campaign four or five days a week, depending on the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll try from time to time to get together, for joint
appearances, but most of the time we'll have separate schedules,''
Cheney said in an interview Sunday aboard his train, which was
rolling through Illinois cornfields. When Cheney campaigns solo, he
said, he will hammer home the same issues _ education, Social
Security reform, tax cuts and rebuilding the military _ that are
staples of Bush's stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotional undercurrent of Cheney's message is a call to
Republicans to evict what they call a scandal-tainted Democratic
administration. ``It will be a tough fight, but it's absolutely
essential for us to do whatever has to be done in order to restore
honor, integrity and decency to the Oval Office,'' he said at a
rally in Joliet, Ill., on Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two candidates' body language at rallies on this four-state
jaunt suggests that Bush is comfortable with Cheney, but not close
in the way the chemistry clicked between Bill Clinton and Al Gore
on their first postconvention bus tour in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney, for example, usually just shake hands after the
introductions. On Sunday, for the first time, each threw an arm
around the other's waist, and they waved together to a cheering
crowd in Joliet, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are opposites in other ways. ``Mr. Cheney has
a wry sense of humor,'' Hughes said. ``The governor's is more
rambunctious.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney did have a rare moment of playfulness as his campaign
train pulled into Akron, Ohio, the other day. When he spotted some
photographers on the platform, he threw his arms up in a
Nixon-esque victory pose, grinning until his wife, Lynne, nudged
him to quit clowning around.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it always takes time for two candidates to mesh. At
times Cheney seems more appended than integrated into the
well-oiled Bush campaign. The 13-page press schedule for the
campaign's whistle-stop tour repeatedly listed when ``the
governor'' arrived at or departed from events. But Cheney was
mentioned only once _ when he and his wife were to get off the
campaign plane in Dallas, one stop before Bush flies on to Austin,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his hamming for cameras in Akron, Cheney still doesn't
seem completely at ease on the podium. He introduces Bush usually
in two minutes or less. Two lines from Cheney's convention speech _
``It is time for them to go'' and ``Help is on the way'' _ are
among the biggest applause lines. The former 10-year congressman
from Wyoming delivers them in a matter-of-fact monotone.
</P>
<P>
   When the more dynamic Bush speaks, Cheney tends to fidget on
stage, folding his arms, then jamming his hands in his suit pants,
and then clasping his hands behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   None of this bothered Republicans who turned out to see their
candidates. ``Cheney just seems very sincere,'' said Teri Almy, 55,
an Iona County clerk who came out for the rally in East Lansing,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Cheney insisted that he is running for ideals
developed over three decades of public service. When Bush asked him
to run, Cheney said he had no good reasons other than personal
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, look at what he gave up: a great CEO's job, making
millions of dollars a year, he had his own private airplane; now
he's out here running for public office, what the hell's wrong with
him,'' Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the crowds on the trail have already vindicated his
decision. ``Mostly what people say is, thank you, we really
appreciate you're willing to take this on,'' said Cheney. ``That
counts for a hell of a lot.''

THE METS' ONLY GOOD NEWS COMES AT A HOSPITAL IN SCOTTSDALE 
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The New York Mets' only victory Sunday came at a
hospital in Scottsdale, where Mike Piazza's left knee was examined
and found to not be seriously injured. There was not much happening
at Bank One Ballpark, where the Arizona Diamondbacks stopped the
Mets, 9-5, in a lackluster game that snapped the Mets' seven-game
winning streak against their rivals from the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had won four straight and 10 of their previous 11
games, their only loss coming when Cincinnati beat Glendon Rusch
last week. Rusch (7-9) was the losing pitcher Sunday, when he
missed his locations at critical moments and the Diamondbacks made
him pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had two of their best hitters out of the lineup.
Piazza, who sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left
knee after crossing first base on a close play Saturday night, will
miss three to five games, and Todd Zeile was given the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets mounted a rally in the ninth inning, helped by Jay
Payton's fourth single of the game. The Diamondbacks, who started
the inning leading by 9-3, had to summon their closer, Matt Mantei,
with two runs in, two runners on and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   The next two hitters were the first baseman and the catcher, but
with Zeile and Piazza out, those hitters were Matt Franco and Todd
Pratt. Franco struck out to end the game, leaving Pratt on deck and
earning Mantei a save.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt's home run off Mantei last October clinched the Mets'
victory in the division series over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a great ball team,'' Mantei said. ``Their lineup
is solid one through eight, and even some of their pitchers can
hit. There's not a thing I don't like about the Mets. I like the
way they play, I like the way they hustle; they play hard. Just to
get a win and get an edge on them a little bit is nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to pitch in this series. After the home run last
year, I wanted to go out and pitch well against them again.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Mets traveled to Houston, where they will
play at Enron Field for the first time, in a four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very dangerous situation,'' Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine said of playing the Astros, who have baseball's worst
record (42-69). ``They're still good players without a good
record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, of course, were supposed to be the more
formidable opponent on this two-city, seven-game trip. But since
Arizona beat the Mets in the second game of last October's division
series, the Mets had won seven consecutive games between the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks won Sunday behind the efficient pitching of the
former Met Armando Reynoso (8-7) and some big hits by Matt Williams
and Greg Colbrunn. Williams had three hits, including a two-run
homer, and Colbrunn had two, including a three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   For Rusch, the four-inning outing was his shortest start of the
season; he had lasted at least five innings in each of his first 19
starts. The trouble began in the second inning, when Rusch fell
behind in the count to Colbrunn, 3-1. Rusch rarely issues a walk,
and his next offering was over the plate. Colbrunn ripped it down
the left-field line for a double, and a single and a sacrifice fly
followed to give the Diamondbacks a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tied the score the next inning, with a big assist from
Colbrunn. With the bases loaded and one out, Robin Ventura hit what
should have been an inning-ending double-play grounder to Colbrunn
at first. But he bobbled the ball and could get only one out,
allowing a run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch retired the first two batters in the third, but Luis
Gonzalez singled and Williams came up. Williams is a productive
home run hitter, but he has lost much of this season to injuries to
his right foot and right quadriceps and had only three homers
coming into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not miss a high fastball from Rusch. He lined it
into the bleachers in left-center field for his first home run in
more than three weeks. The Diamondbacks led, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the Diamondbacks' fourth, a walk and a single put two runners
on with one out. A sacrifice accounted for the second out, and
Rusch got ahead of Tony Womack, 1-2. He had retired Womack on a
breaking ball earlier, and he tried one again. But the pitch hung
in the strike zone, and Womack whacked it up the middle, scoring
two runs and increasing Arizona's lead to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of games, one pitch is going to make or break the
ballgame,'' Rusch said. ``You need to identify that point in the
game and make quality pitches there. If you don't, it could cost
you the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   After a walk, the pitching coach Dave Wallace came to the mound
to visit Rusch. The left-hander stayed in and retired Gonzalez to
end the inning, but he left for a pinch-hitter in the fifth, having
allowed five runs, seven hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch's opponent was the right-handed Reynoso, who has not lost
against the Mets since leaving them as a free agent after the 1998
season. Reynoso, who beat the Mets twice last year, gave up five
singles through six innings, but he faltered in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and a runner on, Mike Bordick drove a pitch just
over the fence in left field for his second home run as a Met. That
cut Arizona's lead to 6-3, and it chased Reynoso from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer and Greg Swindell finished up the inning, and the
Diamondbacks put the game away in the seventh, when Colbrunn bashed
a three-run homer off Dennis Cook. Cook had allowed only one run in
the second half of the season before giving up three in one inning
Sunday.

VITRIOL FLIES AFTER WEB SITE PUBLISHES ACCOUNT ABOUT COLUMNIST
</HEADLINE>
  By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Establish a Web site with lots of links to other sites, and they
call you an aggregator.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Romenesko, a man much noticed in his own profession
because he notices it back, has begun to reach out far beyond his
humble html beginnings. His MediaNews.org Web site is becoming an
online version of the local bar, where journalists go after hours
to argue, to announce their new jobs, to toast their friends and
denounce their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Romenesko, a journalist himself, has transformed
himself twice over.
</P>
<P>
   First he was a simple, if obsessive, aggregator who created a
site linked to other sites featuring media news or media criticism
_ offering what Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The Portland Oregonian,
called one-stop shopping for such material.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was hired by a journalism research center, the Poynter
Institute, and, along with his links, he made a place for running
discussions, like the current give-and-take _ or bash-and-poke _
between journalists and public relations people who sometimes are
called flacks by the journalists. (The nastier themes of this
particular battle are punctuated with some gentle intermezzos, like
the observation that ``Flacks are like spouses: half the time, they
just want to be heard.'')
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he expanded his portfolio once again with the
publication of a lengthy revisionist history of the 1998
controversy involving the columnist Mike Barnicle of The Boston
Globe _ who was accused of plagiarism by the newspaper _ complete
with new details provided by Barnicle. This is a new stage in the
evolution of MediaNews.org. It is not just for links any more. And
it is not just for journalists any more.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Eugene Kennedy, who is identified as an author
and a columnist, is based on some original reporting, new documents
provided by Barnicle and a review of the record. It argues that
Barnicle was the victim of shifting standards and deeply mixed
messages from the editor of The Globe, Matthew V. Storin. (Storin
said Friday that he had followed the discussion but did not want to
comment on it or on the new direction of Romenesko's site.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the first people to send e-mail to the site after
Kennedy's article was posted was the author Norman Mailer, who
wrote: ``Despite the position of The Boston Globe, I don't think
Michael Barnicle received anything in the way of a fair or balanced
judgment. And the careful assessment in Eugene Kennedy's piece goes
just about all the way to prove it.'' The historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin and her husband, the political consultant Richard Goodwin,
wrote to call the Kennedy piece proof Barnicle was a victim of
``political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Peter Maas, a sometime collaborator with Barnicle, who
paused just a second with his nod to the ``fine Kennedy piece on
Barnicle'' before lambasting Richard Blow, a former top editor at
George magazine, over his handling of a piece by Maas and Barnicle.
Blow's response came quickly, and began, ``Has Peter Maas fallen on
his head?''
</P>
<P>
   Then things really took off. Journalists at two different
publications were claiming all or partial credit for Barnicle's
downfall. The disagreement between Blow and Maas escalated (Maas
called Blow's assertions ``fiction,'' while Blow responded that
``Peter Maas didn't like being fact-checked then, and apparently he
doesn't now.'')
</P>
<P>
   One amused bystander observed in his own posting that ``I don't
pretend to know the relationships among your correspondents about
Mike Barnicle _ they sound like they all live in the same condo and
hate each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on any given day, vitriol can fly in any discussion
thread on any site. What sets Romenesko's site apart, beyond its
continual evolution, is the seriousness with which it is followed
among print and online journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Celia McGee, a reporter for The Daily News in New York,
announced her move from media columnist to feature writer on
Romenesko's site, and Steven Brill, the founder of Brill's Content
_ one of Romenesko's regular links _ used it as a public forum to
discuss how free-lancers should be compensated for the online
resale of their work.
</P>
<P>
   The redesign of the online magazine Salon was excoriated by
Romenesko's readers. Salon's editor, David Talbot, said in an
interview on Friday: ``On the one hand, it's a little embarrassing
to have your dramas played out that way on a bulletin board for
everyone to comment on. On the other hand, it's a useful way for
journalists to sort out these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barnicle article, and the attendant discussion, however,
stretched the concept of a discussion toward the breaking point. As
James Naughton, president of the Poynter Institute, explained in an
interview, ``We weren't vouching for'' Kennedy's long, long e-mail,
``but we weren't holding it out of the dialogue about a substantive
ongoing issue in journalism.''

ON BASEBALL: YANKEES TOO SUCCESSFUL FOR THEIR OWN GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trapped in the Bronx, or thoughts from the deepest,
darkest recesses of George Steinbrenner's mind:
</P>
<P>
   I just can't believe what's happening. What's wrong with these
people? I tried for years to warn them of the dangers of coming to
Yankee Stadium, and for years they heeded my warnings. Remember
1996? I did some of my best work that year. We won the World
Series, but we had only two and a quarter million fans come to the
old ball yard in the Bronx. It was no coincidence that it was
during that year that my friend the mayor released a report
recommending the construction of a new park on the West Side of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   I have only myself to blame. I dragged my feet and didn't let
Rudy know what I wanted to do. I kept saying I'd announce my
decision after the season. I just never said what season. I never
said I'd take Manhattan, forget the Bronx and Staten Island, too.
If I had, maybe I wouldn't be in this quandary. Look at what has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Another crowd of 50,000-plus showed up at the Stadium Sunday for
the game with Seattle that we played so badly I should have offered
them tickets for another game. That makes 11 crowds of 50,000 or
more in the first 53 home dates, four more than last year for the
same number of dates. (I don't keep these things in my head; I just
tell my PR people to get me the information and they jump.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Yankees history, not just my history but
the Yankees' entire history, we are averaging 41,000 fans a game.
If we just maintain that average _ and I'm afraid we're going to
exceed it as we get closer to another championship _ we'll finish
with a total attendance of 3.32 million. Last year we reached 3
million for the first time, and we would break that record.
</P>
<P>
   So how on earth am I supposed to convince anyone that we need a
new park? Why would the city and the state be willing to spend a
billion dollars or more on a new park when we're doing better than
ever at the old one? Not just better than ever, really, better than
anyone would have ever expected.
</P>
<P>
   We got too good for our own good. We are a prisoner of our own
success. In the mid-70s we went to the World Series three years in
a row and won two in a row, and in those three seasons we had a
total of 6.44 million fans. We'll have more than that just for this
season and last.
</P>
<P>
   We have become too attractive. The fans find us too
irresistible. We're like a human magnet that is pulling people into
the Bronx despite the dangers. At this point, we probably couldn't
even justify renovating Yankee Stadium for three-quarters of a
billion. That's what the 1996 study said it would cost. Today it
would probably cost closer to a billion. Rudy's a lame duck. He
probably couldn't even push that plan through.
</P>
<P>
   My luxury boxes, will I ever get my luxury boxes? Baltimore,
Cleveland, Seattle and Detroit have luxury boxes. Colorado, San
Francisco, Houston and Arizona have luxury boxes. For heaven's
sake, Pittsburgh and Milwaukee are going to have luxury boxes. And
George Steinbrenner isn't going to get luxury boxes. I get the
Grand Concourse that hasn't been grand for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   But now that I'm thinking about this, maybe I should forget
about it. Who needs a new park with luxury boxes if those other
incompetent owners are going to take my money? Yeah, remember that
blue-ribbon report? Those guys want to take half of my local
revenue and give it away. They want to play Robin Hood and rob me
of my hard-earned money and give it to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   I can just see my good friend Bud wearing green tights and
riding from place to place dropping off bags of my money. One for
the Expos and one for the Twins and one for this team that never
wins.
</P>
<P>
   This year they're going to take about $25 million from me and
spread it around to those so-called small-market clubs. Right. When
did the Angels and the Phillies become small-market clubs? Next
thing you know, they'll be giving some of it to the Mets, too.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs to generate more revenue just to give it away? If I
want to give money to charity, I can send a check to the Little
Sisters of the Poor. It'll cost me a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   That report said we already have the most local revenue _ $650
million for the past five years, it said. With our local television
money going up in a new deal, way up _ I have to be careful and not
talk out loud about it because we've been sued over it _ our total
local revenue will go up. So we will already be giving away more of
my money. Why should I sweat out construction of a new park or
renovation of the one we have just so those greedy guys can get
their hands deeper into my pockets?
</P>
<P>
   I have no intention of operating the George Steinbrenner
Foundation for Wayward Baseball Teams. I gotta call Rudy in the
morning and tell him I've made my decision. No more
procrastinating, no more fence-sitting. Rudy, we're not going
anywhere. But you better reserve your seats for the rest of the
season. They're flocking to the Stadium. What a wonderful place to
see a ballgame.

ESTYLE.COM EVENT WILL PREP PLAYERS FOR U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Some of the world's top women tennis
players will be looking for a bit of a bounce when the estyle.com
Classic begins today at the Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, in its 19th year, boasts one of its top singles
fields ever, with many of those star players feeling as though they
have something to prove this week after recent disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis and Lindsay Davenport, ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in
the world and seeded the same way, both suffered stunning
early-round defeats last week at the Acura Classic in Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
   Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, winner of four career Grand Slam
titles, has advanced past the quarterfinals just four times this
year, and Serena Williams must worry not only about matching her
breakout 1999 season, when she won five tournaments, but also about
matching her older sister, Venus, who won Wimbledon and the Acura.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I'm not very happy with the way I've played this
year,'' said Serena Williams, the defending champion who has just
one victory this year. ``I think I could have won a few more
tournaments and done a little better here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I still have the rest of the year left, and we're
going into the last part of the season. So I feel that I'm going to
do a lot better. The second portion of last year, after the U.S.
Open, I was really focused.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open, which begins in three weeks, will be on all the
players' minds. Manhattan Beach serves as a chance to restore
confidence heading into the final Grand Slam event of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams, 19, earned her first Grand Slam title last year
at the U.S. Open and hopes that Manhattan Beach will once again be
the jump-start that will carry over to New York later this month.
She missed two months of this season with a knee injury but reached
the semifinals at Wimbledon, where she lost to her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm practicing really hard,'' Williams said. ``I'm not taking
hardly any time off. I'm really going for it. I really feel I'm
going to do well (at the U.S. Open) again this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Williams, Davenport or Hingis stumble again this week,
there are plenty of other players capable of winning.
</P>
<P>
   At age 26, Monica Seles is one of the oldest players among the
tour's elite but has won three singles titles this year and reached
the Acura final. Seles is ranked No. 5 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Conchita Martinez, thought to be on the downside of a long and
consistent career, rebounded earlier this year by reaching the
Australian Open final. Amy Frazier upset Hingis is the
quarterfinals of the Acura Classic, and wild card Alexandra
Stevenson reached the Wimbledon semifinals in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-player tournament begins today at 10 a.m. and concludes
with the championship match Sunday.

   HEYBELI ISLAND, Turkey _ The marble floors are polished to a
high gloss. The latest scholarly journals are arranged with care in
the famous library. The sparse dormitories are spotless and, in one
huge hallway, two pingpong tables stand ready, nets taut.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is in perfect order at the Holy Theological School of
Chalki, one of the most historic and important seminaries in
Orthodox Christianity. But the only students are the ghosts of
monks and priests who lived and trained here for over 1,000 years
before the Turkish government closed the school in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pleadings of Orthodox leaders and the urgings of
Turkey's allies, most recently President Clinton, Turkish
authorities insist that the school remain closed under a law that
gave the government control over higher education in religious and
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The primary motive for the law was to impose government
authority over training Islamic clerics, but it also snared the
theological seminary run by the Greek Orthodox Church on the
picturesque Heybeli Island, in the Sea of Marmara.
</P>
<P>
   The name means ``saddle bag island'' in Turkish, and it derives
from the two hilltops that embrace the lower harbors, though the
Greeks called it Chalki. The island is part of a small archipelago
known as the Prince's Islands about an hour's ferry ride from
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth century, the monasteries and convents on the
islands became infamous as a place of exile for ousted Byzantine
rulers, with emperors and empresses alike finding themselves
banished to cells there. In the latter part of the 19th century,
the start of steamboat service allowed wealthy Istanbul residents
to build summer villas in the islands. Leon Trotsky lived in a
mansion on the largest island from 1929 to 1933.
</P>
<P>
   The islands retain a quaint charm, despite the profusion of
villas and apartments. Cars are used only by police and for garbage
pickup, and on a summer weekend the air is filled with the
clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages and the shouts of bathers
fleeing Istanbul's heat.
</P>
<P>
   The theological school on Heybeli Island was built in 1844 atop
one of the two hills, on the site of the Holy Trinity monastery and
school, which dated to the ninth century. The school's library is
regarded as one of the richest in the world in old and rare works.
Like the rest of the school, the library is cleaned meticulously
each day by the four clerics and 14 employees who maintain the
school.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader
of the world's 220 million Orthodox Christians and Leader of the
Greek-Orthodox Church, arrived at dockside here aboard a private
boat with an entourage of archbishops and priests. The patriarch's
primary residence is in Istanbul, but he regularly visits the
island to lead services in the school chapel for island residents
and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   As sunbathers gawked, the black-robed, bearded patriarch stepped
agilely into a carriage for a trip up the winding road to the
theological seminary. Like each patriarch before him, Bartholomew,
60, was educated here. Sitting in his sparse quarters after his
arrival, he reminisced painfully about the scholarly atmosphere
during his years here and lamented the seminary's closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a religious institution like the Ecumenical Patriarchate,
which is accepted and recognized throughout the world as the first
seat of the Orthodox Church, it is inconceivable not to have a
school, an educational institution to prepare coming generations,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than half of Turkey's 75 Greek Orthodox churches are open,
in part because of a shortage of priests. And the population of
ethnic Greeks, with an average age of 60, has been whittled from
150,000 to about 2,500 over a century of expulsions, attrition and
migration, church officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish authorities have kept the seminary closed partly out of
historic antipathy for the Greeks. But the more pressing fear is
that opening this school would lead to demands for similar freedom
from Islamic religious groups, an element of society on which the
secular government keeps a firm grip.
</P>
<P>
   Still, last spring brought a glimmer of hope. Clinton had
pressed Turkey on the issue in Istanbul the previous November, and
warming relations with Greece seemed to make the timing good.
Opening the school was regarded as a gesture that would keep
progress going. Even President Suleyman Demirel privately supported
the move, church officials had heard.
</P>
<P>
   But Demirel was denied another term, and the pace of improving
relations between Turkey and Greece has lost some momentum in the
continuing disputes over such tough obstacles as boundaries in the
Aegean Sea and how to govern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from both countries have exchanged sharp words in
recent weeks and the two architects of the closer ties, Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey and Foreign Minister George
Papandreou of Greece, postponed a meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greek-Turkish rapprochement will be difficult to sustain if
nothing happens this fall,'' cautioned a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   No one in authority is arguing that relations between the
countries are on the rocks, but prospects for re-opening the
seminary have dimmed. Still, each day the floors are shined and the
library is dusted in preparation for the next class of students.

SEATTLE OPERA RETURNS TO ITS ROOTS WITH RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By R.M. CAMPBELL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its third production of Wagner's ``Der Ring des Nibelungen''
over the past 25 years, Seattle Opera has returned to its roots: a
concern for Wagner's text and evocation of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   The latest edition, premiered in part this past weekend at the
Opera House, employs technological advances in stagecraft, as well
as imagination on a high order and some of the best singers plying
the composer's treacherous waters today.
</P>
<P>
   The result is thoroughly engrossing _ visually and musically and
dramatically _ with an excitement both visceral and intellectual.
For the first two operas in the cycle, ``Das Rheingold'' and ``Die
Walkure,'' Seattle Opera general director Speight Jenkins has
assembled an extraordinary cast which is, at the least, equal if
not superior to most ``Ring'' casts in the world. As a group, they
have handsome tone and startingly electricity and the requisite
power to fill the nearly 3,100-seat house. And, directed by Stephen
Wadsworth, they make Wagner's drama, often static in less inventive
hands, a vivid theatrical enterprise. Swiss conductor Armin
Jordan's conducting is a revelation of detail and sensuous beauty.
Thomas Lynch's set design _ ``green'' to the core at Jenkins
insistence _ is often awesome, in a sober way, and surprisingly
realistic.
</P>
<P>
   With all the contemporary ``Ring'' cycles afloat on the world's
stages, it is more fashionable, even glamorous, to do something
radical than something traditional: for instance the ``Ring'' that
premiered last week at the Bayreuth Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Opera sought a ``Ring'' traditional in concept but not
traditional in execution, a production with values Wagner would
recognize: the naturalistic world the composer envisioned but did
not have the means to realize.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch's set design is remarkable in many ways, at times so real
one forgets it is a theatrical illusion. The opening Rhine scene is
the cycle's coup de theatre, with Rhinedaughters ``swimming'' in
midair. It is spectacular and enchanting and really works. The
forests in ``Rheingold'' and ``Walk &UR; gfumlaut &LR; ure'' are not pretty _
they are hungry for air and light _ but they are telling. The first
is sparse and the former gnarled and tight. The wild and rocky
mountainside in ``Walk &UR; gfumlaut &LR; ure'' is magnificent and
awe-inspiring; so is Loge's fire. Making the first scene in Act II
the same as Act I will raise eyebrows because it is such a
departure from Wagner's directions, but it makes dramatic sense.
Martin Pakledinaz's costumes are quiet in design but immensely
clever in the ways they drape the singers, make the extended drama
coherent and spark new ideas. Peter Kaczorowski's lighting design
is also notable and totally integrated.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's stage direction is a marvel of detail that
elucidates relationships and keeps the action moving. One could
cavil about occasional gestures, but their sum total is a
revelation of character and motivation, even unexpected humor and
theatrical pizzazz.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was astonishing, especially the women singing
Brunnhilde, Fricka and Sieglinde. Jane Eaglen sang very well
indeed, a substantive growth of musical expression and confidence
in the four years since I heard her do Brunnhilde at Lyric Opera of
Chicago. With Wadsworth directing her, she has never appeared more
as an actress. Stephanie Blythe, in her Seattle debut as Fricka,
has huge reserves upon which she can draw. There is a shiny glint
at the top of her voice and depth and character at the bottom. She
is not merely big in voice: She sings the music, colors and phrases
it with discretion and a sense of theater. Another local debut was
Margaret Jane Wray, singing Sieglinde. Her performance, in a word,
was thrilling. With a brilliant soprano totally at her command,
Wray conveyed the torment of her character as well as her
exhalation. The voice has steel in it, but the kind of metal that
glistens and glowers.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Maultsby is one of the few to remain from the second
``Ring.'' Her Erda has become greater in dimension and her voice,
richer and more resonance. Marie Plette was a good Freia,
attractive and appealing. The three Rhinedaughters _ Lisa Saffer,
Mary Phillips, Laura Tucker _ were amazing because they sang well
while flying in mid-air and doing somersaults in two directions.
The valkyries looked terrific _ handsome women in handsome
costumes, well-directed. I have never seen the scene better staged.
</P>
<P>
   The men were also impressive. Phillip Joll is a committed,
persuasive Wotan, although more in ``Walkure'' than ``Rheingold.''
He is a character difficult to like, yet Joll made him sympathetic.
Stephen Milling's Fasolt in ``Rheingold'' was moving and Hunding in
``Walkure'' terrifying. Whereas he was sympathetic in
``Rheingold,'' he was horrific, in presence and voice, in
``Walkure.'' Again, he is a singer with a big, impressive voice who
doesn't just sing loud. Mark Baker's portrait of Siegmund was
engaging and persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Paul Fink was a menacing Alberich, who actually sings
the music, which many don't. He was also an ardent suitor of the
Rhinedaughters, slipping and sliding at his own peril, or so it
seemed, at the bottom of the Rhine. Peter Kazaras sang a
calculating Loge, dispensing bolts and bits of fire wherever he
went. James Courtney was a good Donner and Thomas Studebaker
equally so as Froh. Thomas Harper's Mime is well-known here, and no
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's conducting was a singular revelation of tonal splendor
and carefully judged dynamics. Balance in the orchestra was
exemplary. When clarity when required, it was there, shimmering and
translucent, but Jordan had no difficulty in summoning Wagner's
awesome demands for sheer sonic power. Orchestral textures
resembled silk, smooth and luxurious in sensibility but solid
muscle supporting it. Even soft, tender passages were firm and
focused. The orchestra, many of whom are members of the Seattle
Symphony, played well for its conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Dean's new supertitles have rendered Wagner's old
German into something poetic, dignified and illuminating, often
with a dollop of archaic English to give it the right historical
feeling and alliteration to mirror the composer's predilection for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities to see, and hear, the ``Ring'' are limited: The
three cycles of Seattle's complete ``Ring'' next summer are already
approaching sold-out status.

 &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR; , who posed last year for Playboy, appears naked
again in American Photo. The shots show Campbell's body
``glistening with water and oil,'' reports the New York Daily News,
which also notes that after pleading guilty to beating up her
assistant, the supermodel recently completed a series of anger
management sessions.
</P>

   In a description of a Manhattan reading starring Harper's editor
 &UR; Lewis Lapham &LR;  and Paris Review editor  &UR; George Plimpton &LR; , the New
York Observer notes the dilemma of ``every Ivy League English major
with a fat trust fund and a tweed jacket'' in deciding which of the
literary lions to hit up for work.
</P>
<P>
   At Harper's, says the Observer, Lapham lurks around ``in his
fancy-man suits;  &UR; Colin Harrison &LR; , hubby of dirty-book writer
 &UR; Kathryn &LR; 
 &UR; Harrison &LR; , (is there) to amuse you; you have to do quite a bit of

   The Paris Review, on the other hand, has ``George Plimpton
riding his bicycle; better cheese at the parties; no work
whatsoever; when you leave they give you an editorial assistantship
at Vanity Fair.''

 &UR; FLASH &LR;

   -- Hours after news of former President  &UR; Gerald Ford &LR; 's stroke
became public, ABCnews.com sent out press releases boasting that
its crew was there first, covering the story with a dozen
newshounds, ``including six reporters at the hospital alone. In an
exclusive interview with ABCnews.com, co-chairman of the GOP
 &UR; Andy Card &LR;  said that he was `terrified' when he received the

 &UR; THE HEARTBREAK OF APPEARANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   -- California Lawyer reports on an ordinance proposed recently
in Pleasanton that would discourage white window trim in the
Foothill Road Area and ban new houses with steep roof pitches,
stucco exteriors or more than 4,500 square feet in area. This
regulation would help ``preserve the rural aesthetic,'' the
ordinance says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the magazine, sports commentator  &UR; John Madden &LR; 
recently bought a house in the 'hood that was built in the 1880s,
has a stucco exterior, steep pitched roof and white window trim.
</P>
<P>
   -- &UR; Stacey &LR; , 29, tells Marie Claire magazine about a doomed
relationship:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met my date, the first thing he commented on was how
great my hair looked. Then, all night long, he kept complimenting
me on how straight it was, how good it looked. ... I saw the $30
blowouts as an investment. I dated him for a few months, and the
whole time, he had no idea I have curly hair. I avoided showering
at his house, we never went swimming, and we didn't go to the gym
together _ so how would he know? I was a little anxious about what
would happen when the summer came, but luckily, we broke up before
then.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Getting your lingerie in order is a fun start toward
organizing your life,'' says Real Simple magazine, which recommends
a $1,774 Stickley lingerie chest.

WHO SAID WHAT
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` `Praise' is an acclaimed and offbeat love story from &LR;

<P>
   -- &LR;   &LR; So what's so offbeat about that? From a press release for a
forthcoming movie.

 &UR; Naomi Campbell &LR; , who posed last year for Playboy, appears naked
again in American Photo. The shots show Campbell's body
``glistening with water and oil,'' reports the New York Daily News,
which also notes that after pleading guilty to beating up her
assistant, the supermodel recently completed a series of anger
management sessions.

   In a description of a Manhattan reading starring Harper's editor
 &UR; Lewis Lapham &LR;  and Paris Review editor  &UR; George Plimpton &LR; , the New
York Observer notes the dilemma of ``every Ivy League English major
with a fat trust fund and a tweed jacket'' in deciding which of the
literary lions to hit up for work.
</P>
<P>
   At Harper's, says the Observer, Lapham lurks around ``in his
fancy-man suits;  &UR; Colin Harrison &LR; , hubby of dirty-book writer
 &UR; Kathryn &LR; 
 &UR; Harrison &LR; , (is there) to amuse you; you have to do quite a bit of
work; when you leave, they give you a mug.''

its crew was there first, covering the story with a dozen

<P>
   -- California Lawyer reports on an ordinance proposed recently
in Pleasanton that would discourage white window trim in the
Foothill Road Area and ban new houses with steep roof pitches,
stucco exteriors or more than 4,500 square feet in area. This
regulation would help ``preserve the rural aesthetic,'' the
ordinance says.

great my hair looked. Then, all night long, he kept complimenting
me on how straight it was, how good it looked. ... I saw the $30
blowouts as an investment. I dated him for a few months, and the
whole time, he had no idea I have curly hair. I avoided showering
at his house, we never went swimming, and we didn't go to the gym
together _ so how would he know? I was a little anxious about what
would happen when the summer came, but luckily, we broke up before
then.''

<P>
   LIVINGSTON, Texas _ Oliver Cruz can barely read and write. He
has an IQ of either 64 or 76, depending on the test. He flunked the
seventh grade three times. He was rejected by the Army after
failing the entrance exam three times and, unable to decipher a job
application, he did whatever menial work came his way, cutting
grass, cleaning house and taking tickets for a traveling carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 33, he has spent 12 years on death row in Livingston for
the rape and murder of a 24-year-old woman, Kelly Donovan, who was
stationed at the Air Force base in Cruz's hometown, San Antonio.
Cruz, who in an interview last week took full responsibility for
his crime and expressed anguished remorse, is scheduled to die by
lethal injection on Wednesday at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who was in special education classes in school, has been
classified as mentally retarded by psychologists for the defense.
The state did not dispute this at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz awaits execution at a time when there is growing opposition
across the country to the execution of the mentally retarded.
Federal law, approved by President Ronald Reagan, bars the
execution of the mentally retarded who are convicted in federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 states that permit capital punishment, 13 have laws
that prohibit execution of the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush, who, like his brother George, is a
strong supporter of the death penalty, told reporters in April that
``people with clear mental retardation should not be executed,''
and a spokesman said recently that Jeb Bush still held that
position. The chairman of the state's Republican Party has recently
pledged to support legislation that would ban the execution of the
mentally retarded in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Gov. George W. Bush has opposed laws that would
prohibit the execution of the mentally retarded, a position that he
still holds, a spokeswoman, Linda Edwards, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush believes that the jury should consider all the
evidence regarding mental impairment and decide whether a death
sentence is appropriate, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation barring the execution of a defendant whose IQ is
below 65 passed the Republican-dominated Texas Senate last year but
died in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said that he
was optimistic about the bill passing next year and that he would
try to raise the IQ limit to 70, which is what it is in several
other states. ``The national and international attention to the
death penalty in Texas has created some momentum,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's lawyer, Jeffrey Pokorak, has asked Bush and the Texas
State Board of Pardons and Paroles for a stay of execution. Pokorak
says he hopes he can postpone the scheduled date for Cruz's lethal
injection at least until next spring, when the legislation that
might save his life will be considered. He wants a full evidentiary
hearing on Cruz's mental condition.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak said a defense psychologist's review of Cruz's school
records showed that they had classified him as ``educable mentally
retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bexar County district attorney, Susan D. Reed, whose office
prosecuted Cruz, said in an interview last week that she opposed
Cruz's request for clemency, primarily because of what she
described as the heinous nature of his crime. ``Here's a woman
abducted off the street, kidnapped, raped, stabbed 20 times,'' Reed
said. She added that Cruz had a history of violence and had once
fired a shotgun at a man. The man did not press charges, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the evidence about Cruz's mental retardation
was ``conflicting.''
</P>
<P>
   While a majority of Americans support the death penalty, state
polls show that most of those supporters make an exception for the
mentally retarded, even in the fiercely pro-death-penalty state of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association, which does not have a position on
the death penalty in general, but is opposed to executing the
mentally retarded, has written to Bush asking that he grant a
reprieve to Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose the execution of the mentally retarded do not
argue that such people should not be held accountable for their
crimes or be severely punished. What they contend is that the
mentally retarded should not be considered so morally culpable that
they deserve the ultimate punishment, which is supposed to be
reserved for criminals who commit the most heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many of the more than 3,600 death-row
inmates in the United States are mentally retarded, but experts put
the number at about 10 percent, said James Ellis, a leading expert
on mental retardation and the death penalty, and a professor at the
University of New Mexico law school.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 34 people who were known to be mentally
retarded have been executed since the Supreme Court reinstated the
death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information
Center, an organization that is opposed to the death penalty.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   One of George W. Bush's first acts as governor, in January 1995,
was to reject a request for clemency for Mario Marquez, who
suffered from severe brain damage, and who had an IQ of 60 and the
skills of a 7-year-old. Marquez was executed _ for the murder of
his niece _ on the evening of Bush's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be God's gardener and take care of the animals,''
Marquez told his lawyer, Robert McGlasson, a few hours before being
strapped onto the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   McGlasson recalled in an interview last week, ``It was like
talking to a 5-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Corrections, said the department does not know how many of the 459
death-row inmates are mentally retarded. The prison has IQ test
scores only for those inmates who might have been tested during an
earlier incarceration, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   One death-row inmate is Doil Lane, whose IQ has been tested at
between 62 and 70, and who has the emotional and intellectual
development of an 8-year-old child, said his lawyer, William
Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was convicted of the rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl,
with the case against him consisting largely of his own confession,
Allison said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on mental retardation say that the mentally retarded
often confess to things they have not done, in part because they
want to please. Allison said Lane's confession was false. ``Given
time, you could get him to confess to anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Allison noted that his client was so childlike that after he
confessed, he climbed into the lap of a Texas Ranger to whom he had
confessed. At his trial, Allison requested a crayon so he could
color pictures. The judge would not let him have one.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, now 39, still longs for crayons. ``I like to clore
((color)) in my clorel ((coloring)) book but you all tuck ((took))
away my clores when you can not hurt no one with a box 24 clores,
just in my book,'' he wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   It took no prodding from the police for Cruz to confess to his
crime, and Cruz's lawyer does not dispute his guilt. But an older
man, Jerry Kemplin, was with Cruz for the rape and murder. Kemplin,
like Cruz, was initially indicted for capital murder, but he did
not confess to anything, instead accepting a plea bargain in
exchange for testimony against Cruz. Kemplin was sentenced to 65
years, with the possibility of parole after serving a quarter of
his term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart guy who doesn't confess, who knows better than to
give evidence against himself, gets the deal,'' said Pokorak,
Cruz's lawyer. ``But the guy who is retarded, who doesn't
understand all the words of his Miranda warning, he gets death.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that a person is mentally retarded who has a
significantly subaverage intelligence, which is generally defined
as an IQ below 70, and who consequently has serious difficulties
coping with routine aspects of daily life, in school and at work.
</P>
<P>
   The condition must have existed since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Mental retardation is distinct from mental illness, although the
two may exist in the same individual.
</P>
<P>
   In the highly publicized case of Ricky Ray Rector, the Arkansas
inmate executed while Bill Clinton was governor but was running for
president, Rector's lawyers argued that he was so mentally impaired
that he did not even know he was about to be executed. But Rector's
condition was not considered mental retardation, because it did not
reach back to his childhood. It was caused when he shot away part
of his brain at the time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The test for whether a defendant is mentally retarded is not the
same test used to determine whether a defendant is insane and
therefore not guilty by reason of insanity. That requires a
defendant to show that he did not know right from wrong. A person
who is able to make this ethical judgment may still be classified
as mentally retarded, depending on IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak is not arguing that Cruz should not have been convicted
by reason of insanity, but that he should not be executed, because
he is mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the lack of precise data about the number of
mentally retarded death-row inmates is that the mentally retarded
themselves struggle to hide their disability, even though in many
cases it is the one thing that might save them from execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather pass as normal than stand up and say `I have
a disability,''' said Timothy Derning, a psychologist in Lafayette,
Calif., who has testified as an expert witness for defendants in
many capital murder trials. ``They have been called `stupid' and
`retards' their whole life, so who wants to say they are mentally
retarded?''
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in a holding cell on death row last week, Cruz had a
pained expression as he answered questions about his lawyer's
emphasis on his mental retardation in the effort to spare him from
execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts to be in that category, that I'm retarded or
stupid,'' Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also recalled his frustration with school, which he said
had led to his dropping out at age 16. ``I was slow in reading,
slow in learning,'' he said. ``Maybe I was a loser. The teacher
would say, `Read this chapter.' I couldn't read.''
</P>
<P>
   He added proudly, ``Now I can write a letter, a half a page.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz did not appear to know what it meant to be mentally
retarded. ``I'm not retarded,'' he said. ``I'm not the kind of
person who is going to go out and hurt people for the fun of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He attributed his crime to his being drunk and on LSD. But he
also said, ``I'm not going to use this as an excuse for what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I was wrong,'' he said. ``I feel real bad about it.
There's nothing I can do to change it, bring that person back. I
want to make things right.'' His eyes filling with tears, he said
that half of him had died that night along with the woman he
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep me locked up,'' he added. ``But don't kill me. I know I
could help people.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the interview, Cruz put his head in his hands
and wept.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Talking in her office in San Antonio, Reed, the district
attorney, raised doubts about Cruz's mental retardation. Noting the
two different IQ scores, of 64 and 76, she said, ``I'm not going to
say that he is or he is not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the jury had heard the evidence about his mental
retardation and had reached its verdict, and that she supported the
jury's judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Pokorak said that the jury had not been properly instructed to
consider evidence of mental retardation, as required by Supreme
Court rulings. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled recently
that while the instruction had not been given, it was not a fatal
constitutional error. Cruz filed an appeal on Friday with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On the general issue of whether the mentally retarded should be
executed, Reed said, ``I'm not willing to make a broad statement
for or against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people charged with capital murder are poor, and so are
represented by appointed lawyers. Many of these lawyers are
inexperienced, and even incompetent, and they often fail during the
mitigation phase of the trial to present the evidence of mental
retardation that could persuade the jury to spare their client's
life.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Ramon Martinez-Villareal is on death row after being
convicted of murdering two people. He has an IQ of 50 and also
suffers from brain damage, schizophrenia and dementia, according to
evidence presented by his lawyers in various appeals.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Martinez-Villareal's lawyer did not mention
his client's mental retardation. Martinez-Villareal, meanwhile, was
not able to tell the difference between the spectators and the
jury, his trial lawyer testified at a later hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the evidence of Martinez-Villareal's mental retardation,
brought out by Martinez-Villareal's postconviction attorneys, has
emerged, the trial judge and the prosecutor have said that
Villareal should not be executed. Nevertheless, Martinez-Villareal
remains on death row.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case involving a Texas death-row inmate, Johnny
Paul Penry, the Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that executing someone
who was mentally retarded was not ``cruel and unusual punishment''
in violation of the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, reversed the conviction of Penry for rape
and murder because the jury had not been instructed during the
mitigation phase of the trial that it could take into account his
mental condition in deciding whether to give him the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Penry, who suffered brain damage at birth, and has an IQ of
about 60 and the mental ability of a 7-year-old, is still on death
row. His lawyers are preparing to return to Supreme Court. Now they
may win the argument that executing the mentally retarded is
unconstitutional, death penalty lawyers and constitutional scholars
say.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in Penry in 1989, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said that a ``national consensus'' had not developed
against executing the mentally retarded. At the time, only Georgia
and Maryland prohibited doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Since then 11 states have enacted laws that prohibit these
executions _ Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, and
Washington. Five other states came close to passing laws during
their most recent legislative sessions _ Illinois, Missouri,
Arizona, Florida and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has not said how many states would constitute
a ``national consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of the rights of the mentally retarded, one
of the strongest laws is Nebraska's, said Jerry Soucie, a lawyer
with the Nebraska Commission on Public Advocacy, a state agency
that represents indigents in capital cases.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which was pushed by advocates for the mentally retarded
and the Roman Catholic Church, says that a person with an IQ below
70 is presumed to be mentally retarded, and requires a judge to
vacate a death sentence imposed before the law was passed, if he
finds by a ``preponderance of the evidence'' that the person was
mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   After the law was passed, two of the 10 men then on death row
had their sentences commuted to life in prison. One had an IQ of
68, the other 65.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois does not have a law prohibiting execution of the
mentally retarded, but Anthony Porter's mental deficiencies saved
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who was sentenced to die for the murder of two people,
and who has an IQ of 51, was 48 hours away from execution when the
state Supreme Court granted him a reprieve so that his mental
retardation could be investigated. The reprieve gave investigators
time to uncover evidence of Porter's innocence, and last year he
was exonerated and released from prison.

 THOMPSON HOPES TO TOUCH GOLD AT END OF THE POOL
</HEADLINE>
  By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is tied with the speedskater Bonnie Blair for most Olympic
gold medals won by a U.S. woman _ five _ but Jenny Thompson's
swimming career carries the slight whiff of unfulfillment. This
sense of incompletion is barely perceptible, but it hovers about
the pool, wafting like a trace of chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   The Winter and Summer Games have always celebrated individual
achievement over team accomplishment, and all of Thompson's gold
medals have come in relay events. So, at 27, she will enter her
fourth Olympic swimming trials, which begin Wednesday in
Indianapolis. It is not a singular medal itself she is chasing next
month at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, or rather not the
gold-plated hardware, but instead a sense of goals achieved,
potential consummated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me, because I feel I'm capable of doing
it,'' Thompson said. ``If this is my last Olympics, I can know that
I'm ending the closest I can get to my potential.'' She added: ``If
I stopped now, I would feel disappointed, not because I didn't get
a gold medal, but because I didn't try. I feel I owe it to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her career will follow the same arc as that of Pablo
Morales, the world record-holder who failed to make the U.S. team
in 1988 and won the 100-meter butterfly in 1992. Except Thompson
has five gold medals. Still, she feels some small inadequacy, one
gold medal lost in what surely was an undetected Chinese doping
scandal, another missed because she found herself trapped in an
undertow of nerves and stress.
</P>
<P>
   Four months before the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain,
Thompson set a world record in the 100-meter freestyle, becoming
the first swimmer outside East Germany to set a world mark in the
event in two decades. At the Barcelona Games, though, Thompson
finished second to Zhuang Yong of China. ``Zhuang immediately
became the focus of a growing suspicion that the Chinese women
swimmers were taking steroids and other prohibited substances,''
David Wallechinsky wrote in ``The Complete Book of the Summer
Olympics. ``With her deep voice, heavy muscles and bad acne, she
fit the profile of a steroid user.''
</P>
<P>
   Many athletes and coaches also became incensed that all
medalists, including Zhuang, were not being tested for drugs after
swimming events, as they were in other sports. Thompson voiced her
concerns, and like Shirley Babashoff before her, she was criticized
for fermenting her skepticism into sour grapes. But, just as
Babashoff had been right about the East Germans in the 1970s,
Thompson was correct about the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 female Chinese swimmers have been caught cheating
in the last decade, including Yuan Yuan, who was found with 13
vials of human growth hormone in her luggage at the 1998 world
championships in Perth, Australia. China has vowed to crack down on
drug cheats, and its female swimmers have lost their dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Wu Yanyan, the 200-meter individual medley world
champion, was removed from China's training camp for the Sydney
Games after testing positive for a muscle-building steroid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have said what I said if I didn't think it was
accurate,'' Thompson said. ``I don't mind being criticized if I'm
saying what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the medical commission of the International Olympic
Committee approved testing for EPO, an endurance drug believed to
be widely used in swimming. But there will be no test for human
growth hormone, a steroid, and other banned substances in Sydney.
Thompson continues to question the desire of Olympic officials to
catch drug cheats.
</P>
<P>
   Women's swimming, perhaps more than any other Olympic sport, has
been tarnished by the specter of drugs. Every East German
performance from 1968 through 1988 _ including all 32 gold medals _
has been discredited by revelations in court of the country's
state-sponsored system of doping. Cheating by the Chinese has been
thoroughly documented, and suspicions about three gold medals won
by the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith at the 1996 Atlanta Games
gained credence last year when she was banned for spiking a drug
test with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there could be a test for growth hormone,'' Thompson
said. ``It makes me angry. The drug is being abused. The technology
is there for a test, but IOC officials are worried about looking
bad. If there is a test and 50 percent of the athletes test
positive, it makes the IOC look really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago at the Olympic trials, Thompson created problems
of her own doing. On opening day, she finished third in the
100-meter freestyle _ only two swimmers qualify in each event _ and
she began suffering from insomnia and self-doubt. The trials
spiraled into the worst meet of her career, and she did not qualify
in any single event for the Atlanta Games. She won three relay gold
medals in Atlanta, but individual gold remained elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the media pressure was getting to me,'' Thompson said.
``I was putting too much pressure on myself. I was worried about my
competitors. I wasn't being myself. I wasn't enjoying the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson began to reassess her career, realizing that she was
too serious and obsessed, narrowed by a kind of tunnel vision that
left her with little besides swimming. ``Winning was the only
important thing,'' she said. ``I really wanted to kill my
competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Atlanta, she said, she recovered a joy that she
experienced as a child in Dover, N.H., swimming because she loved
to be in the water and to race with her friends and to do frivolous
things, like eating Jell-O from a box. That childlike joy is
leavened by a wider world view. Swimming is no longer the only
thing in her life. A 1995 graduate of Stanford, Thompson has been
accepted into medical school at Columbia University, which she
plans to enter next August.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had had the dream Olympics I wanted to have in Atlanta, I
wouldn't be here,'' Thompson said of the trials. ``I think, in a
large way, it was a blessing. I learned so much about myself and my
swimming.'' She added: ``I've never lost the desire to win a race,
but I do see it with a different perspective. Now I have much more
joy. I enjoy the whole process, the crowds, the kids, my teammates
cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has been swimming faster than ever, using weight
training, yoga and stretching exercises to increase her strength
and flexibility. Last year Thompson set a world record in the
100-meter butterfly, 57.88 seconds, breaking a mark by Mary T.
Meagher that had stood for 18 years. Last month Thompson broke her
own U.S. record in the 100 freestyle in 54.27, set a personal best
of 1 minute 59.49 seconds in the 200 freestyle and came within
two-hundredths of a second of her best in the 50 freestyle, 25.20.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the trials, Thompson will wear a version of the so-called
Fastskin bodysuit made by Speedo, which mimics sharkskin and
decreases drag in the water. A number of world records have been
set in similar suits this year. U.S. officials banned the suits
from the trials, saying they were not available to everyone, then
reversed themselves after one manufacturer threatened to file a
grievance. Thompson said she would wear a version that covers her
legs but not her arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel my legs are raised higher in the water; it doesn't take
as much energy to stay afloat,'' the 5-foot-10-inch, 160-pound
Thompson said. ``I'm a densely muscular person. With the suit, it's
easier. It streamlines the body so it can flow through water
easier. It's like control-top pantyhose.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, winning an individual gold medal may not be any easier in
Sydney than it was in Barcelona and Atlanta. Inge de Bruijn of the
Netherlands has set blistering records in the 50 and 100 freestyle
this year and has twice lowered the 100 butterfly record. It stands
now at 56.64, a stunning 1.2 seconds below Thompson's old mark,
bringing inevitable public suspicion about doping, which de Bruijn
has vehemently denied. The old Jenny Thompson might have become
bitter, unnerved. The new one has not, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I feel her times are skeptical is irrelevant,''
Thompson said. ``They are real world records. I don't feel like
they're impossible times for me to do. They are real times for me
to shoot for and surpass.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the race she really wants in Sydney, the 100 butterfly,
perhaps to break yet again a record that was once considered
unbreakable. There could be no greater validation of her longevity
and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really motivated, this being the end of the road and
wanting to live up to my potential,'' Thompson said. ``An Olympic
gold medal would be nice.'' &QL;

WORKERS BEGIN STRIKE AGAINST VERIZON AS TALKS CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va. to Maine)  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of workers fanned out to picket sites throughout the
East Sunday as negotiators for Verizon Communications and its
unions pressed forward with efforts to end a strike by about 86,000
telephone employees.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly affecting routine services, the labor dispute at
Verizon, the nation's largest local and wireless telephone company,
disrupted operator-assisted services, repairs and installations for
25 million residential and business customers from Maine to
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the strike, over issues including the outsourcing
of work and the unionization of employees in the wireless business,
may help to define the role of organized labor in some of the most
rapidly growing high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could open the door for unions to move not only into
wireless but into other high-tech parts of the economy as well,''
said Paul Osterman, professor of management at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was able to limit the immediate impact of the strike by
deploying about 30,000 managers to cover tasks normally performed
by the striking employees. Automated services on Verizon's network
and wireless services were not disrupted. But delays in repairs and
operator-assisted services could become more common as the workweek
begins.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers picketed at several
hundred Verizon facilities in several East Coast cities, there was
progress in the talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday night, Verizon offered concessions that would
allow the unions to organize more easily in the company's
fast-growing wireless division, a central bargaining issue that
could have a substantial effect on labor relations in the entire
wireless communications industry, said people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was formed by Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE and its
venture in wireless communications with Vodafone AirTouch. But
while it operates the nation's largest wireless carrier, only a few
dozen of the wireless company's 32,000 workers are union members,
compared with 80 percent of the 120,000 employees in Verizon's
local telephone division.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the company and the unions approached compromise on
the wireless issue, job security and Verizon's practice of
outsourcing work in fast-growing areas like the installation of
high-speed Internet lines, they appeared to be far apart on other
issues Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   According to a spokeswoman from the Communications Workers of
America, the unions and the company remained most divided over
forced overtime and job stress.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side appeared optimistic that an agreement could be
reached late Sunday, although the unions and Verizon said they were
ready to continue negotiations throughout the evening and into the
morning if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, striking workers in 13 Eastern states and the
nation's capital dug in for a walkout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I figured it out: three days,'' said Roger
Doucette, 53, when asked how long he could afford to be on strike
from his job as a trainer at a Verizon service center in Braintree,
Mass. But he said he was ready to strike as long as necessary,
given his particular concern over the company's policy of
outsourcing work in the installation of high-speed Internet lines.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, only a scattering of union members could be
found at Verizon facilities, perhaps because of the progress in the
talks. At the company's headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, six
protesters, clad in red for union solidarity, stood behind police
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to sabotage. We just want more money,'' said
Shirley Harris, 33, an administrative assistant. ``It's very
expensive to live in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, the strike generated greater tension between
workers and management.
</P>
<P>
   In Pennsylvania, striking employees blockaded entrances to
Verizon's main switching facility in Philadelphia, effectively
keeping managers from entering the building. In Delaware, some
strikers also blocked access to facilities. The company was seeking
court injunctions to deal with these cases, said Eric Rabe,
Verizon's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 740 union workers out of 3,100 scheduled to work in
the strike region Sunday showed up. Most of those were in New
Jersey and not covered under the same contract as the striking
workers, according to Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   Managers were expected to work 12-hour shifts to provide stopgap
service while the strike continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while I'll probably get tired of this,'' said
Stephenne L. Bell, who normally does budget tracking analysis in
Verizon's marketing and communications department. On Sunday, she
was working a 5:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. shift at a customer service
center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, where about 2,500 telephone lines were put out of
service Sunday because of a cut line, Verizon said repairs could be
delayed because of the walkout.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Verizon deals with an average of 2,600
requests for telephone installations and 4,500 requests for repairs
each day, said Steven Marcus, a spokesman for the company.
</P>
<P>
   As the company moved to handle potential service problems and
talks continued, the negotiations were of particular interest to
employees in Verizon's largely nonunionized wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of being treated like a second-class citizen within
the company,'' said a customer service representative from a call
center in Woburn, Mass. She declined to provide her name, she said,
because Verizon had told employees at the call center that they
would be fired if they discussed joining the union on work
premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a union contract, I'd have chances for better pay,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the union, customer service representatives at
Verizon's wireless unit who are not union members in Massachusetts
make about a third less than unionized employees who do virtually
the same job in other parts of the company. The company says pay
differences are much smaller than the union's claim.
</P>
<P>
   The union is seeking assurances from Verizon that the company
would not interfere with or actively discourage organizing
activities at the wireless division, making it easier for the union
to sign up employees. Because Verizon Wireless controls nearly 30
percent of the wireless market, the outcome of the strike could
affect labor relations throughout the wireless industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If labor can't penetrate the new economy, they will be
assigned to its margins,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, a sociology
professor at the City University of New York. Aronowitz compared
the situation to union efforts in the 1930s to organize in the
automotive and steel industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going after the biggie with the idea that the others
will fall in line,'' he said.

THE `KID' SPLASHES TO VICTORY IN WHITNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ It said so right there in the
past-performance charts: Lemon Drop Kid did not like running around
a wet track. Through a dreary week of rain, his trainer, Scotty
Schulhofer, worried that Saratoga Race Course would come up spongy
on Whitney day. When the showers began to fall an hour before the
race Sunday, Schulhofer thought he was cursed.
</P>
<P>
   But the horse he has called the best he has ever trained skimmed
over the surface as if he were fitted with water skis. Lemon Drop
Kid's two-length victory in 1 minute 48.1 seconds in the Grade I
race showed _ at least for now _ that he was the best older horse
in the handicap division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned that it would get sloppier,'' Schulhofer
said. ``It was just wet enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the third victory in a row for Lemon Drop Kid, and it
rewarded Schulhofer and his owner, Jeanne Vance, handsomely for
their belief in a horse that has often been overlooked. The
winner's share for the victory was $680,000 and was supplemented by
a $230,000 bonus for capturing the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association's champions bonus, a series of races for older horses
that was televised on Fox over the past seven months.
</P>
<P>
   In the winner's circle afterward, as Schulhofer was losing a
wrestling match with an umbrella, rival trainer D.Wayne Lukas
chided him good-naturedly: ``Don't worry about the umbrella,
Scotty. You can afford a new suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, a 4-year-old son of Kingmambo, made his purse
look like easy money as he stalked David, Cat Thief and Golden
Missile, who had compiled the most formidable recent numbers coming
into this mile-and-an-eighth event. Edgar Prado, Lemon Drop Kid's
jockey, let those three run in front for three-quarters of a mile
before angling wide around them coming out of the turn.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the horse that Prado had to collar was the
Lukas-trained Cat Thief, who has not won since the Breeders' Cup
Classic nine races ago and was sent off at odds of 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure if I would get another chance to move again,''
Prado said of how he decided to turn on the jets. ``He dug in real
game when Cat Thief came again.''
</P>
<P>
   For 30 yards or so, it looked as if Cat Thief's new rider, Jorge
Chavez, might break his horse's losing streak as he banged shoulder
to shoulder with Lemon Drop Kid in the stretch. ``He was giving me
everything, but the other horse was stepping quicker and easier,''
Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cat Thief and Chavez fared better than Behrens, the prerace
second choice, who clipped heels with Golden Missile at the start,
stumbled and splashed home a well-beaten third. In a bit of a
turnabout, the trainer James Bond had replaced Chavez with Jerry
Bailey even though Chavez had ridden Behrens in his last 14 races,
five of them victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in contention, but never really fired,'' Bond said.
``I've had better days.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite now winning a Grade I stakes in each year of his career
_ including the Belmont and Travers Stakes last summer _ Lemon Drop
Kid has failed to stir devotion among horse enthusiasts. He was
sent off as the lukewarm favorite at 2-1. But Schulhofer always
believed. Three races ago, he replaced Jose Santos with Prado. Two
races ago, he adding blinkers to Lemon Drop Kid to focus the colt,
especially when he was turning for home
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like he's still improving,'' said Schulhofer, a
Hall of Fame trainer who is pointing the colt toward the Breeders'
Cup Classic in November at Churchill Downs and a run at the
championship. ``It looks like he's at the top of his game, and all
we have to do is keep him healthy and strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a month to the Woodward, then a month to the Jockey
Club Gold Cup and three weeks to the Breeders' Cup. I don't think
it will be too much for him. He's finally found out what racing is
all about. He was just playing around before we put Edgar and
blinkers on him. He's finally running the way I knew he could.'' &QL;

VENUS WILLIAMS PROVES TOO POWERFUL FOR SELES
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHAEL ARKUSH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ The seeded players have yet to be announced
and the sages have yet to weigh in. Even so, with the U.S. Open set
to begin in three weeks, a favorite has emerged among the women.
Her name is Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams started her run last month at Wimbledon, of course,
with an impressive victory over Lindsay Davenport in the final, and
has not slowed down since.
</P>
<P>
   With her 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-3 triumph over Monica Seles on Sunday
in the Acura Classic at the La Costa Resort and Spa, Williams
captured her third tournament title and 15th match in a row.
Despite 14 double faults in the match and a loss of focus during
the second set, the third-seeded Williams continued to serve notice
that she can dominate a match against a quality opponent even when
she is not at her most formidable. Although she committed 34
unforced errors, she recorded 38 winners, using the powerful ground
strokes that have made her so successful.
</P>
<P>
   For her opponents, there is almost no defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play my best tennis,'' said Williams, who, bothered
by the sun, had 10 double faults in the second set. But, she added,
``I'm still winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first set, Williams rolled past Seles in 18 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hitting the ball with some pace,'' Williams said. ``I
was hitting it deep.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Seles picked up her first-serve percentage
and came through at several key moments.
</P>
<P>
   Although she squandered a 5-2 lead, and it appeared as if she
might lose the match in two sets, the fourth-seeded Seles played
well in the tie breaker _ aided by three double faults from
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Seles could not maintain the momentum in the deciding set. She
rebounded from a service break to record her own, putting the match
back on serve at 4-3. But the resilient Williams immediately broke
back to seize control once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a key game for me to hold,'' said Seles, who is now
0-3 against Williams. ``If I could replay something, that would be
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles realized she was in trouble from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feet were dead out there,'' said Seles, who has been unable
to practice because of a blister on her left hand. ``I felt asleep.
I thought I better wake up or it would be over in 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Waking up is exactly what Anna Kournikova seems to be doing in
time for the United States Open. Although Kournikova was defeated
by Seles here in the semifinals Saturday and is still searching for
her first tournament victory, her list of conquests at this event
included Davenport and Nathalie Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   The Open also affords a great opportunity for Williams to assert
herself as the game's new premier player.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged on Sunday that there are aspects of her game
that she still needs to improve. She was unhappy with her footwork
in the Seles match, for instance. Before the Open begins, Williams
will have an opportunity to work on improvements to her game at the
Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   But she may not need to play any better than she did on Sunday.
As Seles said, ``The way she's playing now, by far, she's the
favorite.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: BUSH'S EDUCATION RECORD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever George W. Bush talks about his achievements as governor
of Texas, the item at the top of his list is education reform,
especially the remarkable improvement in test scores by the state's
public school students.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech Thursday night, he told the party's
delegates, ``We improved our schools dramatically, for children of
every accent, of every background.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Laura, in her address to the convention last Monday,
said, ``The highly respected nonpartisan Rand study released just
last week found that education reforms in Texas have resulted in
some of the highest achievement gains in the country among all
racial, socioeconomic and family backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   That happened, she said, ``because George led the way'' by
focusing state money and the attention of the schools on reading.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exactly. George W. has done some nice work with the
school system in Texas, but he can't legitimately claim much of the
credit for the gains documented by the Rand study. The dramatic
improvements in the public schools in Texas were the result of
years of hard work and big spending that not only predated Bush,
but were inspired and organized by none other than H. Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The Rand Corp. study was a state by state analysis of scores
from standardized tests that were given in math and reading from
1990 through 1996. The study found that the most important
components in raising student achievement appeared to be smaller
class sizes in early grades, widespread access to pre-kindergarten
classes and improved classroom working conditions for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The study compared scores from one state to another by students
from similar socioeconomic backgrounds and found that youngsters in
Texas did especially well. ``Texas,'' the report said, ``was in the
highest group of states and California in the lowest on scores for
students from similar families.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with George Bush taking credit for this achievement
in the years 1990 through 1996 is that he did not become governor
until 1995. And, as the authors of the report have made clear, it
takes several years for students to realize the benefits from the
kinds of reforms in place in Texas. Improved test scores in the
fourth and eighth grades, for example, come from students who were
part of the reform effort when they started school.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in Texas were no accident. When Mark White was
governor back in the 1980s, he got Ross Perot to lead an
educational reform effort that led to both smaller classes and the
most extensive public school pre-kindergarten program in the
nation. This was no altruistic initiative. It was in response to a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Perot's effort also led to a re-allocation of school spending,
with more money being used for disadvantaged students. Thanks to
White and Perot, Texas found itself approaching the vanguard of
education reform. When Ann Richards was governor in the early '90s,
she expanded the original effort and offered some new initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   While George W. Bush had little or nothing to do with the gains
reported in the Rand study, he has maintained his state's focus on
education reform. He was responsible for a reading initiative that
is widely admired. and he has not undermined the reforms he
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Bush, if he is thinking about the improvements
he could bring to public schools nationwide if he becomes
president, is the fact that both he and his party are opposed to
federal assistance for the very programs that have meant so much in
Texas _ smaller class size and pre-kindergarten programs.
</P>
<P>
   David Grissmer, the lead author of the Rand study, believes
substantial help from the federal government is essential. He noted
that after adjustments for inflation, some states spend as much as
$9,000 per pupil per year, while others spend as little as $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   You can't have smaller classes in the early grades, and expanded
pre-school, and more classroom tools for teachers without an
infusion of additional resources from somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, in this era of plenty, could lend a
much-needed hand to school systems across the country. To get that
done, Bush and the Republicans would have to do a pretty neat
philosophical shift.

METROPOLITAN DIARY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A weekly column featuring readers' reports on life in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   File under ``D'' for dogs and ducks, or perhaps ``C'' for
Central Park and Cheyenne, the wayward Australian shepherd mix who
captivated crowds at Turtle Pond one steamy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began at 8:15 a.m., well within the park's 6-to-9
a.m. window for dogs to romp off leash. Heading down the path from
Belvedere Castle with her guardian and two canine siblings,
Cheyenne suddenly broke away and bounded into Turtle Pond, home of
snapping turtles, ducks and loons.
</P>
<P>
   An astute mother mallard directed her ducklings toward the tall
grass to the north, and proceeded to quack and flap her wings
wildly. Cheyenne began a hot pursuit and although her clunky paddle
was no match for the duck's easy glide, she was not deterred. Pleas
from her agitated owner, a tennis ball thrown in her path and the
gathering crowd failed to distract her from the task at hand.
Cheyenne was no ordinary dog.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes later, the police and park staff arrived.
Someone suggested that the owner herself be sent into the pond to
catch the dog. The owner, at wit's end, shed her sandals and made
her way into the snapping-turtle-infested waters. Thus we saw a
duck followed by a dog followed by a wild-haired woman wearing a
life preserver provided by the Park Conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that the woman had no more chance of catching
the dog than the dog did of catching the duck. Finally two police
officers took off on the pond in a rowboat. The capture was swift.
The last thing we saw was the owner standing over Cheyenne, shaking
her head and shouting, ``Cheyenne, how many times have I told you
not to chase ducks!''
</P>
<P>
   _ LAURA MORRISON
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Holzwarth's friend Debra Sweezey of Stone Mountain, Ga.,
was preparing Jessica, her 4-year-old daughter, for her first trip
to Manhattan. Sweezey mentioned some of the sights they would see,
and said they would ride the subway, ``a train that runs under the
ground.'' Wide-eyed, Jessica asked: ``But how do we get down to the
train? Do we have to dig?''
</P>
<P>
   THE IMAGE
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you have seen me _ strolling in front of the Plaza or
exercising in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   I was born beautiful! How many times have I heard it! Life is
never easy when an image must be preserved. As we grow older, it
gets harder. If you really look closely, there are some signs of
change. I still look good _ from a distance?
</P>
<P>
   My hair was always my best feature. Now it takes twice as long
to get it the way it used to look. The daily manicure is a
nuisance. Borderline starvation is the only way to keep my
slimness. If that goes, I'm finished. I've always prided myself on
my figure.
</P>
<P>
   How I envy you average-looking females, gaining weight, letting
yourself go. Rollers, old bathrobes, you are still loved. No hours
in the beauty salon for you, listening to boring females.
</P>
<P>
   I still love the attention. I never tire of being admired. I am
superior. But the price is getting too high.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I'll say goodbye to it all, let my hair go, keep late
hours, gorge myself until I'm sick, run around my back yard, roll
in the leaves and mud. I'll be free. Free to be myself, just
another Yorkie.

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Like many, I am annoyed by people's supposed needs to have phone
conversations wherever they are. Recently, my perspective shifted.
</P>
<P>
   I was taken by ambulance, in the middle of the night, to Beth
Israel Hospital North with severe abdominal pains. In the morning,
I began to worry about my outside appointments for that day and the
next. I had no money with me, but I soon discovered that Beth
Israel provides a cellular phone in the emergency room for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   I called my neighbor, who has my keys, told her whom to call in
my address book and got that worry off my mind. Later in the day,
another cell phone came to my rescue as my neighbor took hers into
my apartment and I directed her from room to room, telling her
where to find things I needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ RETTA BLANEY
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of cell phones: Judith Nochimson Stein was
on a Wall Street-bound subway on a weekday when it stopped for
almost an hour because of a fire in the station ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes, as the passengers sat frustrated and restless,
fretting about missed appointments and irate employers, a lone
entrepreneur made his way through the cars, yelling, ballpark
style: ``Call your offices, call your families. One dollar a minute
on my cell phone.'' He wasn't discouraged when Stein's car produced
smiles but no takers. He just went on to the next.
</P>
<P>
   R. Michael Wirin parked on 36th Street recently, and when he
returned a few hours later, his one-touch ``keyless'' key holder
wouldn't open his car.
</P>
<P>
   After thinking of paying a streetwise kid to break into the car,
or throwing himself on the mercy of a police officer, he hailed a
nearby parking attendant, hoping the man wouldn't hold it against
him that he hadn't entrusted his car to the lot.
</P>
<P>
   The attendant took the clicker in hand and said, ``Empire State
Building.'' Wirin explained that he wasn't a tourist looking for
that skyscraper. The attendant scrambled under the car and voila,
the locks magically opened as he reappeared and said again,
``Empire State Building.'' At this point, Wirin asked him to
explain.
</P>
<P>
   It was common knowledge, the man said, that the huge transmitter
atop King Kong's perch often disables electronic devices in the
neighborhood.

MANHATTAN'S REAL ESTATE MARKET NOW SIMMERING, INSTEAD OF BOILING 
</HEADLINE>
  By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thrill is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan's over-the-top real estate market, on a fast roll for
more than four years, has lost its frenzied upward momentum _ at
least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be buyers, who this spring seemed caught up in a
grab-it-now-before-it's-gone panic, suddenly have lost their
desperate urge to buy. In the last two months, real estate brokers
and statisticians say, bidding wars have declined, apartments have
stayed on the market longer before being sold, and hundreds have
even been marked down. Manhattan real estate prices are finally
leveling off.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things everyone is beginning to feel is that the
market is flat,'' said Deborah Beck, executive vice president of
the Real Estate Board of New York. The board measured a 22 percent
drop in the number of city apartments sold in the quarter ending
June 30, compared with the same period last year _ a figure Beck
called ``a significant slowdown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The edge is off the market,'' said Jonathan Miller, president
of Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm that compiles citywide
statistics for Douglas Elliman, the city's biggest brokerage firm.
Especially during the last month, Miller said, ``we're seeing much
more modest appreciation, more of a return to normalcy.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts, including Miller, are quick to warn that the changing
statistics, which mirror a national trend, may not signal the start
of a downward spiral like the one in the late 1980s and early '90s.
But one thing is certain: One of the biggest sellers' markets in
New York history has suddenly tilted more toward the buyer _ and
the buyers are noticing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his two years of looking, Tom Pappas, a
Midtown lawyer, has spotted the same properties showing up week
after week on his Internet searches. But he is not biting until
their prices go down. Then, he vowed, ``I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts call it a simmer, no longer a boil. Sales volume is
down, and prices are no longer soaring. While brokers insist that
no one is grasping at low-ball offers, most brokers concede that
more sellers now are accepting modest reductions off the asking
price than were doing so earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Many link the chill to the Nasdaq plunge that began on April 14,
and to the last interest rate increase _ the half-point in May. In
interviews, the brokers and statisticians said that today's buyers
were more cautious, that they spent more time looking, but that
many did, in the end, buy _ and at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   In a report Miller is just finishing, he found that the average
property spent 28 percent more time on the market than it did
during the same period a year ago, 118 days versus 92 days.
</P>
<P>
   These changes reflect a national trend. Fred Flick, the vice
president for research at the National Association of Realtors,
said the real estate market nationally was down 6 percent in
volume; by the end of the year, the association estimates that
volume will be down 9 percent. And while it still predicts average
price increases at 2 percent to 3 percent this year, that is less
than last year's 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The national slowdown was confirmed on Thursday, when the
Commerce Department reported that across the country, new home
sales fell 3.7 percent in June to the lowest level in two and a
half years. Median prices fell slightly.

ARTS CRUSADE FOLDS ITS TENT AT HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Three years ago an experiment in artistic
democracy began. And last week it ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, a heady mix of
summer camp, artists' colony, encounter group and think tank
founded and directed by the playwright and actor Anna Deavere
Smith, closed its doors on Friday _ at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Each summer for the last three years the institute assembled a
group of artists and scholars for six weeks of what Smith called
``artistic boot camp.'' The artists presented their works in
progress _ pieces of theater, dance and music intended to induce
dialogue about civic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars were invited to jump into the fray. And a core audience
of people who had agreed to go to every performance had been
gathered to join in the discussions after each performance.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year program, with the W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for
Afro-American Research at Harvard University and the American
Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., as joint hosts, cost $4.2
million and was paid for largely by a grant from the Ford
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is best known for her one-woman plays ``Fires in the
Mirror,'' about the conflicts between blacks and Jews in Crown
Heights, Brooklyn; ``Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992,'' about the riots
after the first Rodney King verdict; and ``House Arrest,'' a
multivoiced meditation on the American presidency and particularly
on Thomas Jefferson's relationship with his slave Sally Hemings and
Bill Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For those plays, Smith interviewed hundreds of people of
different races and ages, somehow managing to internalize their
expressions, anger and quirks enough to be able to portray them
with astonishing verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue was, in some sense,
like an Anna Deavere Smith play writ large. She said she was trying
to ``create a frame'' that would hold ``many different voices and
histories and expressions in the same place and still be
coherent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of performances, a 22-year-old Rwandan
playwright, Hope Azeda, presented her play about hatred and
reconciliation between the Tutsi and Hutu; the singers Suzzy Roche
and her sister Maggie sang prayers written by audience members;
Sheila Kennedy, a professor of architecture at Harvard, pondered
the cultural fear of hollow spaces; Patricia Williams, a law
professor at Columbia University, and Oliver Lake, a jazz
saxophonist, riffed on cloning, shadows, the apocalypse and the
subjunctive; Smith screened ``Twilight: Los Angeles,'' a movie
based on her play; and on the final night a multiracial cast
performed ``Piano,'' her play about the Cuban insurrection against
Spain in 1898. The art was not there for art's sake, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The art is a mask'' for social issues, Smith said. The point,
she suggested, is not to fasten on the mask but ``to get behind
it,'' to ``engender discussion.'' And ``the audience is a critical
part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Smith's play ``Piano'' was a prime example.
Before the performance, Smith told the audience that her aim was to
write a play that would throw many classes and races together in
one living room and that would allow the actors to act in their own
skins.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of ``Piano'' is a plantation house owned by Spanish
colonials. Little do they know that the people who clean and cook
for them every day are insurrectos, revolutionaries planning to
free Cuba from Spain and to free themselves from domestic slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna, an African, is the head of the staff and has adopted an
African girl to clean the floors and to be her revolutionary
protegee. She trains her by telling her that the piano is an angry
lion whose paws she must clean without stirring the beast.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese cook makes African food. His wife is a smiling
Chinese hostess and the mistress of the Spanish master of the
house. The music teacher seems to be part Spanish, part African.
</P>
<P>
   The drama begins when some visitors arrive: a rich and liberated
American woman traveling with her African-American boyfriend, and a
brutal Spanish general, the brother of the man of the house, who
has come to defend Spanish interests against the insurrectos and
rape some women along the way. The house is a revolutionary
tinderbox, ready to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Brilliant as it is, the play was not the thing. It was merely
the mask. The final act belonged to the audience. A woman asked why
some of the audience members who remained grave at moments when
race was discussed had laughed at japes about rape and male
anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   A man from the core audience piped up, ``It's a democracy.''
Someone else tried to break into the conversation, only to be
hushed. Donald Byrd, a choreographer who had been at the institute
for all three years, said it was the ``laughter of recognition.''
And the dialogue ended with one of the institute artists, Margo
Jefferson, who is also a columnist for The New York Times, saying
she trusted laughter as a response a lot more than sobriety. The
crowd dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   The response that Smith wanted to evoke, she said, was not a
standing ovation, which she got, but rather an audience full of
people who rise to their feet and say, ``What can I do?'' That was
not what she got.
</P>
<P>
   In her final week at the institute Smith said, ``It has been an
extraordinary laboratory.'' More than anything, she said, the
institute has set her thinking about three words, ``We the
people.'' In this world, there is ``no single great explainer,''
she said. `` `We the people' means something different than it did
in 1968. We still haven't figured out how `we' is a big `we.' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the easy part was dealing with the artists. She
recalled some of her favorite moments and most had to do with a
melding of voices. She thought of Ysaye Barnwell of Sweet Honey in
the Rock getting 200 people singing and rocking to four different
spirituals at the same time. She thought of Suzzy Roche singing a
Vietnam veteran's private prayer, which Roche called a ``melting
experience.'' And there were Williams and Lake, creating what
Williams called ``an allusive conversation'' between music and
speech.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part, Smith said, had to do with the audience. The
first year there were about 160 in the core audience, but they had
only four performances to go to. The crowd was unusually varied.
Williams recalled a performance where some people in the audience
had once been homeless or in prison. But at the end there were 15
performances and the core audience, about 90 people, was not as
mixed as it might have been. Although there was a mix of races and
ethnicities _ 58 white, 24 black, four Hispanic, two Asian, two
Indian, one Arab _ the great majority were middle-aged or older and
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps part of the difficulty had to do with being on the
Harvard campus. Of course, there were some obvious advantages.
Cornel West, a professor of Afro-American studies and religion at
Harvard, showed up and ``blessed'' almost every performance.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of professors, including Henry Louis Gates Jr.,
the chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard,
and Charles T. Ogletree, a Harvard law professor, were often there,
ready to leap into the civic debate at a moment's notice. But there
were disadvantages too. ``People conflate Cambridge with Harvard,''
Smith said. It was hard to draw people from other neighborhoods in
the Boston area consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has been at the institute for three years, said,
``We didn't reach every last person in Roxbury.'' And that may have
had something to do with being at Harvard. ``I'm from Roxbury,''
Williams said, ``and when I went to law school at Harvard I was
self-conscious about whether I had the right to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is not so different from the practical difficulty
presented in ``Piano'': the insurrectos must plan the revolution
while living in the house of the Spanish masters. Are they really
free to talk as they please? Where else could they meet? Can any of
the masters be trusted? How big can ``We the people'' be?
</P>
<P>
   Smith was given a standing ovation after the screening of the
movie ``Twilight: Los Angeles,'' in which she herself had taken the
roles of dozens of people, including a Beverly Hills real estate
agent, the trucker Reginald O. Denny, one of his assailants, a
looter, a Korean woman whose husband was killed, a pregnant
Hispanic woman who was shot in the crossfire, the former police
chief Daryl F. Gates, the diva Jessye Norman and Professor West
drinking cognac.
</P>
<P>
   She took the opportunity to ponder the question of bigness and
to compare herself to a surgeon who was asked why he had chosen to
operate on children with cancer. Expected to say something about
saving children's lives, he simply said, ``It gave me the
opportunity to do a bigger operation.''

12-YEAR-OLD BUTTERFLY SPECIALIST SWIMS INTO OLYMPIC TRIALS
(Corrects throughout)
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jeff Caplan 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With dolphin-like swiftness and ease,
12-year-old Dana Vollmer has propelled herself from Granbury's
summer swimming league to a shot at the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Amid 1996 Olympic gold-medalists Jenny Thompson, Beth Botsford
and Amanda Beard, all of whom will converge on Indianapolis for
this week's U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, Dana is rapidly revealing
herself as a rising star. Sporting a lean frame of nearly 5-foot-9,
she is sharp, focused and bursting with talent.
</P>
<P>
   She regards Thompson, a two-time Olympian, as her ultimate hero
_ Thompson is the world record-holder in Vollmer's top event _ yet
her path to this point mirrors Botsford and Beard. Those two, both
sophomores at Arizona, rocketed onto the Olympic scene in Atlanta.
Beard was 14; Botsford was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dana has a chance to eclipse that when she takes the water
Wednesday in the 100-meter butterfly, though she is more likely a
serious contender for the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try really not to think about it because I get myself worked
up and nervous before the meet,'' Dana said Friday morning after
completing her final practice session at the Forest Park pool.
</P>
<P>
   A family play day at Hurricane Harbor was up next, only two days
before her scheduled arrival in America's heartland and braving a
new world: elite Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic-caliber swimming is unlike gymnastics or figure skating,
where younger often means better. Adolescent swimmers face an
upstream battle against fully developed athletes who have been
training and competing at a world-class level around the calendar
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Botsford and Beard were, Dana appears to be a prodigy
in the making. Until recently, Dana didn't register a blip on the
selective radar of the Fort Worth Area Swim Team (FAST), an
extension of USA Swimming and a year-round elite swim club. That is
a major difference from her youthful predecessors, who began
year-round training years before making the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Dana, remarkably, joined FAST only last September. Her parents,
Les and Cathy, a longtime swim coach who has tutored her daughter
for years, chose to forgo the life-changing commitment of full-time
training for a couple of reasons. The drive to Fort Worth and the
nearest Olympic-sized pool is 50 minutes from the Vollmers in
Granbury, but the drive was only part of the reason they didn't
make the trip regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been coaching a long time, and I've seen a lot of young
kids that were really good get burned out really early and then
they quit,'' Cathy said. ``As soon as you switch over to full time,
it's full time from now until after college, and that's a lot. You
do have to keep reminding yourself that she's just 12, that she
needs to be a kid and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the switch to full-time training _ about 11 practices a
week for two-hour sessions twice a day, starting at 5:30 a.m.
coming up in the fall _ has come as naturally to Dana as the
butterfly stroke she started to perfect at age 5 when mom toted her
around in a backpack when she coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been people really good at 12, but not at the level
she is,'' said Ted Murphy of FAST, Dana's instructor since joining
the club. ``She is basically one-in-a-million. She is swimming in
senior national events. The top 1 percent of all swimmers are in
those meets.''
</P>
<P>
   Proof is in her times. In the past six months, Dana has set
three national age-group records in the butterfly. Two of those
records, the 50-yard and 50-meter butterfly had belonged to
Botsford, set in 1993. Dana's third record, in the 100-meter
butterfly, blasted an 18-year-old mark set by Jennifer Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Dana is so advanced that she doesn't swim against competitors
close to her own age. Instead, she is routinely blowing away
college-age swimmers at high-level meets.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dana: ``I don't think they really realize \Rmy age\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana's 100-meter national butterfly record of 1:03.07, set July
15, qualified her for the Olympic trials by two-hundredths of a
second. It is about four to five seconds off the pace she probably
will need to make the Olympic team, which carries two swimmers in
each event.
</P>
<P>
   She has two primary goals this week. Making the Olympic team is
the ultimate. On a more realistic level, Dana said she wants to
make the semifinals, which would put her in the top 16. Also, a
time of 1:02.21 would automatically place her on the U.S. National
Junior team, a squad that competes internationally and is the next
logical step on the road to the 2004 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Her rapid rise hardly seems to affect Dana, who will soon have
to make some athletic choices. This month, she will enter seventh
grade, the first year students can participate in scholastic
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play volleyball, basketball and track,'' she said.
``Right now, it sounds kind of weird, but I love basketball as much
as I love swimming. I hear things like, `But you're going to the
Olympic trials.' I've always dreamed of playing in the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Calm and mature, the significance of her supersonic success and
a blazing bright future might be more incomprehensible right now
for Dana's parents than for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of ignoring it because it could be so big that it
would overwhelm me and therefore influence her,'' Les Vollmer said.
``This trip to Indianapolis, we are trying to find a bunch of
things to do, call it a vacation, and, oh by the way, on Wednesday
you're going to swim for a spot on the U.S. Olympic team.'' nn

12-YEAR-OLD BUTTERFLY SPECIALIST SWIMS INTO OLYMPIC TRIALS
(Corrects throughout)
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jeff Caplan 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With dolphin-like swiftness and ease,
12-year-old Dana Vollmer has propelled herself from Granbury's
summer swimming league to a shot at the Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Amid 1996 Olympic gold-medalists Jenny Thompson, Beth Botsford
and Amanda Beard, all of whom will converge on Indianapolis for
this week's U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, Dana is rapidly revealing
herself as a rising star. Sporting a lean frame of nearly 5-foot-9,
she is sharp, focused and bursting with talent.
</P>
<P>
   She regards Thompson, a two-time Olympian, as her ultimate hero
_ Thompson is the world record-holder in Vollmer's top event _ yet
her path to this point mirrors Botsford and Beard. Those two, both
sophomores at Arizona, rocketed onto the Olympic scene in Atlanta.
Beard was 14; Botsford was 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dana has a chance to eclipse that when she takes the water
Wednesday in the 100-meter butterfly, though she is more likely a
serious contender for the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try really not to think about it because I get myself worked
up and nervous before the meet,'' Dana said Friday morning after
completing her final practice session at the Forest Park pool.
</P>
<P>
   A family play day at Hurricane Harbor was up next, only two days
before her scheduled arrival in America's heartland and braving a
new world: elite Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic-caliber swimming is unlike gymnastics or figure skating,
where younger often means better. Adolescent swimmers face an
upstream battle against fully developed athletes who have been
training and competing at a world-class level around the calendar
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Botsford and Beard were, Dana appears to be a prodigy
in the making. Until recently, Dana didn't register a blip on the
selective radar of the Fort Worth Area Swim Team (FAST), an
extension of USA Swimming and a year-round elite swim club. That is
a major difference from her youthful predecessors, who began
year-round training years before making the Olympic team.

FROSH WILL REPORT TO UCLA TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Size doesn't matter _ or so UCLA hopes in regard
to its Napoleon-sized freshman football class of just 14
scholarship players, which reports to the coaching staff today.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, at least five true freshman have played each season
and Bruins coach Bob Toledo doesn't expect this year to be any
different. He said five true freshman have a good chance to play
right away: linebacker Brandon Chillar, defensive back Ben Emanuel,
punter/kicker Chris Kluwe, receiver Tab Perry and Valencia High
running back Manuel White.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3, 185-pound Emanuel, from Clear Brook High in
Friendswood, Texas, and the 6-foot-3, 218-pound Perry, from
Milpitas, were recruited nationally and walk into situations in
which the Bruins could use some help.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel, whose cousin Bert came to UCLA as a quarterback before
transferring to Rice and becoming an NFL receiver, could make an
impact at safety, which is the team's most unsettled position.
Sophomore Lovell Houston is coming off surgery on both shoulders
and won't be ready to practice Saturday, Toledo said. Jason Zdenek,
a little-used fifth-year senior from Chaminade High in West Hills,
and former strong safety Audie Attar are among the other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, meanwhile, could help at a position that is short on
playmakers beyond starters Brian Poli-Dixon and Freddie Mitchell.
Kluwe, from Los Alamitos, could push sophomore punter Nate Fikse
and White, a 6-foot-2, 229-pound tailback from Valencia, would be
the biggest in the Bruins' stable.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the class, offensive tackle Paul Mociler, from
Bellflower St. John Bosco, was considered among the top prospects
in the country at his position before he tore knee ligaments last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The freshmen check in today and go through orientation before
starting workouts Tuesday afternoon. The upperclassmen report
Thursday and begin practice Saturday for the Sept. 2 season-opener
against No.3-ranked Alabama at the Rose Bowl.

companies are looking for any market that can deliver revenue and

The goal is not only to sell goods to the government to help build
its e-commerce systems, but to provide goods that government
purchasing agents can buy through those same systems. Steven Tinchak,

United House of Prayer, a nondenominational Pentecostal church that
claims 3 million congregants in 28 states, holds mass baptisms across
the country each summer as part of a convocation ceremony in which
congregants seek holy renewal. Since access to rivers is limited and
pools aren't easy to find in New York, the House of Prayer has always
used the municipal water supply, blessed by the church's bishop.

 NEWEST PALM IS STREAMLINED AND SIMPLIFIED  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reaching out to less-technical users, Palm Inc.
will today add a new low-cost member to its popular series of
handheld organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm m100, like the low-end IIIe model it will replace, will
be priced at $149. But the m100 offers several new features
designed, the company says, to make it more attractive to shoppers
who aren't especially computer-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are new tutorial software, an on-screen digital clock
visible through a hole in the unit's protective cover, and a new
Note Pad program that allows users to scribble names and numbers on
the screen of the device even before they master Palm's Graffiti
writing system. The Note Pad, which may eventually be offered on
other Palm models, in effect saves a picture of the handwritten
data in a format known as ``digital ink.''
</P>
<P>
   The new model also introduces a new look for Palm: In addition
to the clock hole, it has a rounded base, and it's narrower across,
making it easy for women in particular to grip, according to John
Cook, the Santa Clara, Calif., company's director of consumer
product marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The standard unit is black, but customers will have the option
of adding snap-on faceplates, priced at $19.95 each, in silver
green, ruby, or light or dark blue.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cradle to hold the device while it's synchronizing
data with a PC or Mac, the m100 will ship with just a cable for
sharing data with a full-size computer.
</P>
<P>
   The new design might help Palm regain some business from
Handspring, which since last fall has offered low-cost,
bright-color organizers based on software licensed from Palm.
According to PC Data, a Reston, Va., market research company, in
June the Handspring's Visor Deluxe became the single best-selling
handheld computer model in U.S. retail channels, with a market
share of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Visor represents a moral victory for
Handspring, which is led by executives who originally founded Palm
and then left it. Overall, however, Palm continues to dominate the
handheld arena, with a market share estimated at about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Palm will also announce several other changes to its product
line today:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Palm VII, which has wireless messaging and
Internet-access capabilities, will be replaced by a new version
called the VIIx, which offers four times as much memory (8
megabytes) and additional software. The VIIx will be $449, while
remaining VII units will be reduced to $399.
</P>
<P>
   -- The company will offer the Palm Vx, its slimmest, sleekest
model, in two new colors, ``Champagne Gold'' and ``Millennium
Blue.'' Priced like the standard silver Vx at $399, the ``Limited
Edition'' color configurations will be sold only on Palm's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Palm announced another special version of the Vx, the
``Claudia Schiffer Edition,'' which will be offered exclusively on
the supermodel's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   -- An Ethernet cradle, announced in October, is finally
available. The $249 device, installed in lobbies, labs, meeting
rooms and other public areas on corporate campuses, will let
roaming employees update the information on their handhelds over
the company network without having to return to their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Palm also reduced the price of the IIIc, its only color-screen
model, from $449 to $399.

 DOT-COMS MARKETING LOGO-CLAD PRODUCTS  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The alarm goes off at 7 a.m. and Dot Consumer
sleepily climbs out of bed and puts on her Pets.com sock puppet
slippers to pad to the shower, drying off with a Bikini.com towel.
</P>
<P>
   After donning a pair of jeans and deciding among 37 T-shirts
with computer logos, she downs a bowl of sugary flakes in a
Hamsterdance bowl, then stuffs her AskJeeves calculator into her
Yahoo backpack and heads out the door, clicking her Autobytel
electronic car remote to unlock her new Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   That's the logo-clad future _ the very near future _ as a
variety of Internet companies envision it.
</P>
<P>
   Internet brands are moving into the real world as dot-com
companies realize that easy cash _ and even more important, brand
awareness _ can be had by licensing their names and mascots for
everything from clothing to electronics to toys.
</P>
<P>
   Only a trickle of products has hit the market so far, but by
Christmas, consumers will be able to stock up on many of the goods
mentioned above, plus a variety of other dot-com goods.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking board games, watches, calendars, clocks, musical
instruments, postcards, puppets, stuffed animals, pillows,
dinnerware, key chains _ tchotchkes up the wazoo.
</P>
<P>
   Make that up the Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Yahoo, the most popular site on the Web, was an early,
enthusiastic convert to licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo first licensed its name to Ziff-Davis for Yahoo! Internet
Life magazine, which started in 1996, and has long had a variety of
third-party-produced Yahoo gear, such as sweatshirts and mouse
pads, available on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's getting into watches, eye wear, stationery, board and
card games, computer reference books, a ``dot-com racer'' toy car,
even a guitar. And it's not neglecting PC-related products: Various
models of speakers, mice and keyboards from Sakar International, as
well as a digital camera from Tiger Electronics, are now in
production.
</P>
<P>
   The royalties on this merchandise are immaterial for the Santa
Clara company, which had $588.6 million in 1999 revenues. What
matters is the branding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been our goal to make Yahoo a tangible brand,''
said Karen Edwards, vice president of brand marketing. With
Yahoo-brand consumer products, ``people have the opportunity to
actually touch and hold Yahoo; it becomes more personal, more part
of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Edwards is realistic about how much consumers actually
like living in a logo world. ``Very few people want to be walking
billboards for brands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Licensing is a natural evolution from the promotional items Net
companies already give away. ``Internet companies have spent a
fortune on premiums. They give away polo shirts, hats, beach balls
with their dot-com address on them. They want people to wear them,
use them, see them and go to the address,'' said Richard Mark
Blank, chief operating officer and co-founder of
NetNameLicensing.com, a New York company that hopes to help dot-com
firms land licensing deals online. ``Boom, the consumer loves their
favorite dot-com merchandise just like they love their favorite
offline brands.''
</P>
<P>
   Licensing is pure gravy for companies lucky enough to have a
compelling brand. The T-shirt or toymakers bear all the expense and
risk up front, paying royalties to the licenser, anywhere from 3 to
18 percent of the wholesale price. The manufacturers have to
guarantee a minimum fee to ensure they won't park a slow-moving
product on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Not many Net companies have gotten in on the action yet. For
that matter, only a handful of online firms have the huge brand
awareness of Yahoo, which is the 53rd most-recognized consumer
brand name, according to Interbrand Group (Coca-Cola, Microsoft and
IBM being the top three). But some people say the potential is
vast, especially since Net-savvy consumers have the young, hip,
affluent demographics companies crave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a great opportunity and the market could be
huge for a select group of dot-com companies,'' said Charles
Riotto, president of the International Licensing Industry
Merchandisers' Association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But ``select'' is the key word. Only very well-known companies
will attract manufacturers to make goods bearing their brand. ``You
have to establish your core brand before an effective licensing
program can be put into place,'' Riotto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is a place where brands are just being created,''
said Marty Brochstein, executive editor of the Licensing Letter in
New York. ``Computer access by consumers is not yet ubiquitous.
There are limitations at this point as to the visibility of
anything that exists only on the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential market is huge: Brochstein said retail sales of
licensed merchandise in the United States and Canada hit $74.15
billion in 1999. Corporate trademarks and brands were the biggest
chunk of that.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some dot-com players whose wares are starting to hit
the market:
</P>
<P>
   -- Pets.com. After carpet-bombing prime time over the past year
with commercials featuring its goofy sock puppet, Pets.com realized
it had a pop culture hit on its hands, along the lines of the Taco
Bell Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   The online pet-supply firm says consumer demand drove its
decision to engage a licensing agent. The sock puppet, a finger
puppet and smaller stuffed replicas of it are on store shelves now,
with slippers, posters, T-shirts, key chains and greeting cards
coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   Again, branding is the main objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of licensing is that by putting your character in
various retail stores, whether on T-shirts, greeting cards or in
the gift section, it literally extends the presence of your
brand,'' said Chris Deyo, president of Pets.com. ``Each puppet will
have a hang tag to drive consumers to our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Deyo said he expects licensing royalties to represent ``a strong
complementary revenue stream'' that will account for under 10
percent of overall sales. However, he noted, ``the revenues flow
right to the bottom line. Royalties are a nice item because they
don't have any cost of goods sold, so they help the overall
economics of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The sock puppet's popularity mirrors that of another recent
advertising icon, the Taco Bell Chihuahua. But there's a cautionary
tale attached: Despite selling 13 million plush toys and creating
national catchphrases such as ``Drop the chalupa,'' Taco Bell has
seen sales stall and recently gave the doggie the boot.
</P>
<P>
   Pets.com says sales have increased twelvefold since it started
the sock puppet campaign. Its situation differed from that of Taco
Bell, because Pets.com was just starting up when the campaign
began.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the sock puppet and its product progeny will drive
people to the Web site long-term remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people know about the sock puppet who don't need
to know because they're not ever going to buy dog food,'' Rebecca
Nidositko, a senior analyst at the Yankee Group, said last month.
</P>
<P>
   -- AskJeeves. The know-it-all British butler from AskJeeves will
soon materialize in the realm of consumer products. AskJeeves.com
of Emeryville, whose primary product is a search engine that
answers Web surfers' questions, has hired two people to help Jeeves
make the leap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to just slap him onto a T-shirt. We would
never do just a standard plush doll,'' said Mary Kean, licensing
manager for AskJeeves. ``We want to combine the character and the
technology to make really interesting products.''
</P>
<P>
   Since AskJeeves is about finding answers and educating people,
she said, Jeeves will appear in educational milieus such as board
games and electronic organizers for children. He'll have his own
calendar with a question of the day; he's already featured in two
self-published books.
</P>
<P>
   Kean, who landed her job by suggesting it to AskJeeves' vice
president of ideas, already has experience with placing brainy
Europeans in consumer products. She previously handled licensing of
Albert Einstein's name and image on behalf of Hebrew University of
Jerusalem. Jeeves and Einstein ``are both great thinkers,'' she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   -- Bikini.com. Modeling itself on ``lifestyle brands'' such as
Martha Stewart and MTV, Bikini.com calls itself ``an online beach
party'' with content and commerce about ``wholesome swimsuit and
California beach lifestyle entertainment,'' according to CEO and
co-founder Gail Sonnenschein. She hopes to branch beyond being
merely a dot-com company, and into television, movies and theme
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1997, the New York company built licensing into its
business model from the beginning. One of its first employees was a
licensing director; today it has four (out of 25) employees
handling licensing.
</P>
<P>
   That approach has paid off with 15 deals so far for beach-themed
products and trinkets bearing its logo: swimwear, of course, and
also towels, totes, jewelry, calendars, music CDs, sandals,
sunglasses and magnets. Half of Bikini.com's revenue derives from
licensing, according to Sonnenschein, and most of the products have
yet to hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenschein waxes lyrical about the benefits of licensing. It
has allowed her firm to spend barely a nickel on advertising, she
said, noting that appearances by Bikini.com models on TV shows have
also helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Wrestling Federation sold $1 billion of licensed
products with ugly wrestlers, so imagine what we can sell with our
Bikini.com supermodels and the boys of summer,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other dot-coms exploring licensing include online car site
Autobytel.com, which is now talking to manufacturers about
Autobytel-branded car accoutrements, such as jumper cables,
wrenches, safety kits and security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hamsterdance2.com, custodian of the jiggling rodents, has a
music CD out now and plans to have T-shirts, plush toys, lunch
boxes, dinnerware, pens and pencils, children's bags, bendable
figures, book covers and key chains.
</P>
<P>
   But all the companies getting into licensing need to observe
some cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest concern would be: Who's the steward of the brand?''
said Jon Callaghan, a partner with CMGI &LR; Ventures in Menlo Park.
``Brands are fleeting. Every customer interaction makes a brand
over time. I would be concerned about the potential downside of no
longer controlling the customer experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's Edwards agrees. ``It's an incredible risk for the
brand,'' she said. ``I never want to see something with the Yahoo
brand in the bargain bin where it's been marked down four or five
times.''

 AD AGENCIES EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With all of the churn in Dot-Comville,
advertising agencies that cater to Internet companies should be
suffering from headaches of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But while most San Francisco agencies have taken some hits since
the April dot-com implosion, a surprising number say they are on
track for robust growth this year, with new business coming from
both dot-coms and not-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We doubled in size last year (to $200 million) and we expect
to double again'' in 2000, said Tom Bedecarre, chairman of Citron
Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco, which specializes in
Internet-related accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all local agencies saw a dramatic slowdown in
new-business solicitations after the April meltdown in Internet
stocks, which particularly hurt sites catering to consumers. Quite
a few e-tailers lost their funding or at least put marketing
efforts on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But phones started ringing again by June, agency executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new clients are business-to-business Internet firms,
infrastructure providers and wireless communications companies. And
of course, non-tech companies continue to spend record amounts on
advertising, particularly with the Olympics coming up.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, advertising spending this year is expected to grow a
healthy 9.4 percent, according to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, a New
York ad shop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few local agencies have escaped the dot-com meltdown
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Exile on Seventh, a San Francisco firm that specializes in
online ads, just won three high-profile accounts _ eBay, Webvan and
People PC, with total annual billings estimated at $20 to $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency, whose clients are all Internet-related, recently
lost five other accounts worth about the same amount, said chief
executive Michael McMahon. ``I went on vacation in June and three
of them completely gave up while I was gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exile's revenues will be flat for the quarter, compared with the
10 percent monthly increases it has seen in the past. ``It's not
terrible, but we're not used to having to worry about it,'' McMahon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't made our first cold call ... but we are going
to start to have to take a more proactive stance toward generating
new business,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Gardner Geary Coll has seen three dot-com
clients stop advertising altogether or ``cut way back'' since
April, said agency President Bob Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com billings have fallen to about a quarter of the agency's
total from approximately a third, Gardner estimated. Still, the
agency continues to hire more staff and he expects overall billings
to increase this year by 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 21, which creates online campaigns for clients such as
Tupperware and Bank of America, has seen two of its 15 clients
defunded. But the agency still expects billings to grow by several
multiples over 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Much of its new business is coming from established offline
companies, such as Tupperware, that are just beginning to advertise
online, said chief executive Kate Everett-Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 21 is using the April downturn to its advantage by
recruiting staff from agencies whose stocks are underwater,
Everett-Thorpe said. The agency is trying to add 100 additional
employees to its current roster of 150, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the volatility, some agencies are relieved that they
didn't make an all-out push into dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we're very smart or we're very stupid,'' said Rich
Silverstein, co-chairman of Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, which
is known for consumer-product advertising such as the ``Got Milk?''
campaign. ``We're careful not to have one kind of industry take
over the entire agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's e-tailing clients, which include E-Trade, eLuxury
and a new client, Hotwire, are spending healthily on advertising,
Silverstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, client volatility remains an issue among not-coms as
well as dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco office of Young &AMP; Rubicam lost 25 percent of
its billings last year when its biggest client, Clorox of Oakland,
consolidated its accounts with another agency.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R expects to replace the lost revenues ``almost exclusively
with tech and dot-com clients,'' said chief executive Austin
McGhie.

GOP AIMS FOR REVENGE ON DEFECTOR IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKHAVEN, N.Y. _ Rep. Michael P. Forbes didn't want to talk
about it initially: the television advertisement that his
Republican foes spliced together to try to humiliate him. Why
dignify it?
</P>
<P>
   Then he reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly, and it's part of the hate-vengeance campaign, and
a very childish approach they are taking,'' said Forbes, the
Democrat who defected from the Republican Party in disgust last
year, and in so doing became the most despised Democrat _ on a very
long list _ among many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats are engaged in one of their fiercest
fights ever this year over control of the House, where the
Republicans have a precarious majority that would be wiped out by
the loss of six seats.
</P>
<P>
   But no individual race quickens the pulse of House Republican
leaders as does Forbes'. In fact, his Long Island seat appears
almost irrelevant to them; it is revenge they seek, payback for the
embarrassment he caused them and the trouble he sowed. On their
list of targets, Forbes, who has served three terms in the House,
places first.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the television advertisement they are considering running.
The ad, which pokes goofy fun at Forbes throughout, ends with the
congressman's clowning around and pretending to make rude sounds by
squeezing his hand under his armpit in the fashion of adolescent
boys.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was an outtake, clipped from a moment of horseplay
after he taped an ad as a Republican, and someone with a long
memory unearthed it for the House Republicans' campaign committee.
So far they haven't broadcast it, although they did treat
themselves to a private screening.
</P>
<P>
   As hard as Forbes and his opponent, Felix J. Grucci Jr., the
fireworks manufacturer, who is the town supervisor here, try to
make their campaign about local issues and local politics,
Washington power brokers cannot resist joining in the rumble and
trash-talking.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him what he thinks of Forbes, and Rep. Thomas M. Davis III
of Virginia, chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee,
eagerly tosses out, yet again, his standard quip: ``Have you ever
heard of the movie `Dead Man Walking'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hit him pretty hard,'' Davis said. ``Forbes is
the most vulnerable Democrat in the House. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Republican leaders have pumped $45,000 so far
into Grucci's campaign coffers from their personal political action
committee funds and have sent Sen. John McCain to stump for Grucci.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are doing their part to help shore up Forbes'
campaign. President Clinton held a fund-raiser in New York City
that raised $500,000 for Forbes, even though Forbes voted to oust
him on all four articles of impeachment. Several Cabinet
secretaries plan to visit Forbes' district, in eastern Suffolk
County. One of them, Bruce Babbitt, the interior secretary, has
already made an appearance there.
</P>
<P>
   One conservative political organization, the Republican Majority
Issues Committee, which is headed by a former member of the staff
of Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, turned on one of
its own icons for political benefit and ran an advertising campaign
tying Forbes to Rep. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a
favorite Democratic target.
</P>
<P>
   And the New York Democratic Party made its own ad, tying Grucci
to ``special interest'' allies, which it said were ``big polluters,
big tobacco companies and big-deal wheeler-dealer Texas
politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The race also pits two archfoes _ big business, which is
generally supporting Grucci, and labor unions, which are helping
Forbes with grass-roots campaigning _ against each other.
</P>
<P>
   To date, according to the candidates, Forbes has raised $1.2
million, and has $850,000 in the bank; Grucci has raised $800,000,
and has $500,000 on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts do not single out Forbes as the most vulnerable
Democrat in the House, but they agree that his race is a tossup and
one of the quirkier battles of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Forbes is in a singularly unenviable position this
political year,'' John Kohut wrote in July in The Rothenberg
Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that handicaps political
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in his newly adopted party who care less about
the Democrats' `big picture' in Washington, and can only regard him
as an old adversary,'' the report notes. ``Then there are Forbes'
old allies in the GOP who see him as the worst type of turncoat and
want to see him humiliated and defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Forbes, 48, stunned his colleagues when he
announced he was leaving the Republican Party _ the party in power
in the House _ to become a Democrat. Standing outside his home in
Quogue, on Long Island, Forbes, a product of Republican machine
politics, unleashed a blistering assessment of his former party,
calling it ``angry, narrow-minded, intolerant, uncaring, incapable
of governing at all, much less from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   The move all but guaranteed a scorched-earth campaign for his
seat this year, and Republican leaders lost no time preparing for
it. They described him as petulant and unprincipled, a man who fled
only because he felt unloved.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had already drawn their ire in 1996, when he became the
first Republican to say that he would oppose Gingrich's second term
as House speaker. But Gingrich was re-elected, and Forbes, a
one-time Gingrich disciple, was snubbed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Forbes, who won his first two terms with 53
percent and 55 percent of the vote, was re-elected in 1998 with 64
percent. The 1st District, home to the Hamptons, Brookhaven
National Laboratory and military plants, is politically Republican,
but Clinton carried it in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at his defection, Forbes says he harbors no regrets
and describes those Republican labels as bunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to be purely political and fake, clearly I
wouldn't have done what I did a year ago,' he said. ``I was in the
majority, in the top committee in the House. I was, in most
people's estimation, a shoo-in for re-election. But there has to be
more to this business than just raw politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Election years, though, thrive on raw politics, and Forbes faces
a nasty race, full of hurdles, all of them rooted in his party
switch.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were naturally not happy about supporting a former
rival candidate, especially one who opposes abortion rights and
voted to impeach the president. With help from national party
leaders, Forbes persuaded almost all of them to overcome their
reluctance, although he faces a nominal primary fight against a
Democrat who is an abortion-rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a public tiff, Forbes further unnerved Democrats by
seeking the endorsement of the local Right to Life Party. The
endorsement went to Grucci. Forbes was also rebuffed by the
Conservative Party and the Independent Party, which supported him
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called regular Democrats _ the apparatchiks _ are
fairly solidly behind him,'' said Brad O'Hearn, a spokesman for the
Suffolk County Democratic Party. ``There are some interest groups
that still have bones to pick with him. But he is meeting with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the Grucci campaign portrays Forbes as an
out-of-touch Washington politician who betrayed Republican
principles. ``Mike Forbes will say or do anything for his own
political expediency,'' said Grucci, who handily won re-election
twice as supervisor of Brookhaven, the largest town in Suffolk
County.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has not stayed silent, though. He and other Democrats
portray his opponent as out of his league in Washington and
question how much he knew about a political scandal that sent a
local Republican chairman to prison.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns about town, Forbes makes a simple pitch: He is
the same man he was before.

 ONLINE INVESTING: MORNINGSTAR SERVICE OFFERS AT-A-GLANCE ANALYSIS  &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Finding good stocks is always a challenge.
Morningstar ( &LR; www.morningstar.com &LR; ) recently introduced an analysis
tool, Market Radar, to help you uncover investment candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Market Radar displays information graphically, rather than
requiring you to interpret numeric data. It's also a free service.
You don't even have to register. Here's how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Select ``Market Radar'' under Tool Box on the left side of
Morningstar's home page to display a graph showing the year-to-date
return of stocks making up the S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   I'll use the S&AMP;P data to explain Market Radar's display format,
and then show you how to search for investment candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A dot ranging in color from red to dark green represents each
stock of the S&AMP;P index.
</P>
<P>
   The dot colors indicate the value of selected data, which, in
this case, is the year-to-date return.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks with the highest returns are dark green, while those with
the worst returns are red. Move your cursor over a dot to see the
stock symbol and the data value (year-to-date return).
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar overlays the stock dots onto its ``style box''
format, comparing valuation to company size. A stock's ``value
score,'' which is based on price-to-earnings and price-to-book
ratios, determines its placement on the horizontal axis.
</P>
<P>
   Companies on the left are considered value priced, and those on
the right, growth stocks. Stocks in the middle are considered a
``blend'' of value and growth. Stocks on the far right are momentum
priced.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says value stocks are less risky than growth
stocks, while momentum stocks carry the highest risk.
</P>
<P>
   However, these traditional relationships between value and risk
have not held true in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The vertical axis represents company size (market cap). The
larger companies (large-cap) are near the top, smaller companies
(small-cap) toward the bottom, and in-between (mid-cap) in the
center.
</P>
<P>
   A stock's value and size ratings determine its placement.
Large-cap, value-priced stocks, for instance, will be clustered at
the top left, while small-cap, momentum stocks near the bottom
right.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked last week, the best performers of the S&AMP;P 500 were
large-cap growth stocks. Mid-cap value and mid-cap blend stocks had
the worst returns.
</P>
<P>
   I determined that using the color bars below the graph. Each bar
corresponds to a dot color. Clicking on a bar eliminates the
corresponding dots from the graph. Clicking again restores the
dots.
</P>
<P>
   I eliminated all except the dark green dots to view the
distribution of the best performers, and then I displayed the red
dots by themselves to see the stocks with the worst returns. Move
your cursor over a dot to see the ticker symbol and the data value
(YTD Return).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you can use Market Radar to find investment
candidates. You first need to identify a group of stocks to
analyze. You can select stocks belonging to a particular index,
trading on a specific stock exchange, in a certain economic sector
or industry group, or from a variety of other categories.
</P>
<P>
   Then, pick data points you want to graph from one of five
categories: Performance, Owners Dividends, Growth Rates, Earnings
Projections and Profitability. Each category includes
subcategories.
</P>
<P>
   Let me demonstrate the process by researching one of the hottest
industry sectors: wireless communications stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Click on ``Select a Universe,'' then ``Stock,'' ``Industry,''
``C-D,'' and finally ``Cable/Wireless Equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   You should see the selected group: ``Stock Universe Industry
</P>
<P>
   Cable /Wireless Equipment,'' displayed near the top. You will
still have the S&AMP;P 500 displayed until you click on ``Select a Data
Point'' to pick a category such as ``Growth Rates.'' And then
select a subcategory such as ``EPS Growth One-year'' and finally
click on ``Graph'' to display the results.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier than it sounds. Start by clicking on ``Select a Data
Point'' and then select ``Performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Select ``One-year Return'' and click the ``Graph'' button to see
the one-year returns of all stocks in the cable /wireless sector.
The stocks with the highest returns are shown in dark green.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in the best performers, use the color bars
to turn off all dots except dark green.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, you may want to eliminate the highfliers and
focus on stocks that haven't taken off yet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, turn off the dark green dots. Also, turn off the red and
orange dots to exclude dogs that may never recover. On the other
hand, value investors may want to focus on the red and orange
underperformers.
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits say you will do best picking stocks with scant
mutual-fund ownership. That's because you can enjoy the ride when
funds finally discover the stock and drive its stock price up with
their heavy buying.
</P>
<P>
   Others, myself included, say it's best to pick stocks with heavy
mutual-fund ownership, indicating the pros have analyzed the
company and like what they see. Whatever your outlook, you'll find
stocks to suit your needs by selecting ``Fund Ownership'' in this
category.

 TECH21: TURNING OFF IDLE PCS COULD HELP END POWER CRUNCH  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With luck, the heat wave gripping the West as I
write will have broken before you read this. But the electricity
shortage the summer sun has brought to light will be with us, in
the best of cases, for years to come. And because increased
computer use is one factor in the crisis, we owe it to ourselves as
well as the rest of society to make sure we're operating our
systems as energy-efficiently as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the amount of power consumed by high tech is still
pretty small compared with applications such as lighting, air
conditioning and industrial production. According to the
Environmental Protection Agency, all office equipment accounts for
about 7 percent of electricity used in business.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency estimates that a typical desktop computer
uses about 45 watts and a monitor an additional 110 watts. And even
those relatively modest numbers may be on the high side: A
spokesman for Dell, the largest PC vendor in the United States,
told me it figures an average of about 40 watts for its PCs and 70
to 80 watts for a 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, roughly speaking, a working computer system
consumes no more than a couple of light bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   But when you figure that there are well over 100 million PCs in
this country, and you factor in the printers, networking gear and
other devices that go with them, the load starts to add up.
</P>
<P>
   And because very little of this stuff existed a decade ago, it
amounts to a big chunk of the increase in demand, even if it's
still not an overwhelming percentage of overall consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at an ``energy summit'' convened in June by the Silicon
Valley Manufacturing Group, one speaker alleged, according to the
Associated Press, that ``computers and computer peripherals now
consume about 13 percent of the nation's available power, a figure
that has soared from less than 1 percent since 1993.'' On its Web
site, the SVMG also declares that ``energy consumption attributed
to Internet usage alone climbed from essentially zero in 1993 to 8
percent in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the record, some experts have told me they consider those
numbers exaggerated, but even so, the trend is clear. There's no
dispute that ``office equipment, computers in particular, is the
fastest-growing source of electricity consumption in businesses and
homes,'' as the EPA puts it.
</P>
<P>
   STARRY EYED: Few of us, I suspect, are about to cut back our
computer usage just because there's not enough juice to go around
right now. But the reality is that much of the energy that goes
into our tech gear goes to waste, particularly in offices, where
computers are usually left on all day _ and often all night and on
weekends, too _ even though, according to the EPA, they're actually
used only about four hours per workday on average.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, the evolution of technology may alleviate the
problem: LCD flat panels consume less than half the power of
conventional CRT monitors, and stripped-down network computers use
much less than full-featured PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you're not quite prepared, financially or otherwise,
for these cutting-edge technologies, there are some simple steps
you can take, both at home and at work, to address the power
problem without causing yourself any real pain or even
inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   One is to make sure any new hardware you buy carries the Energy
Star logo. A voluntary partnership between the EPA and industry,
the Energy Star program has been around since 1992. It sets
energy-efficiency targets for some 3,400 types of products in 25
categories, from appliances to windows.
</P>
<P>
   Products that meet the criteria for their category can bear the
Energy Star logo. Certification is required for many government
procurements, as well as some corporate purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The program classifies all computers and peripherals, regardless
of actual location or use, as office equipment. In this category,
the standards focus not on the products' power draw when in use,
but on making sure they're capable of dropping automatically into a
low-power ``sleep'' mode after a period of idleness.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, which are updated from time to time,
computers are entitled to the logo if they consume no more than 15
percent of their maximum power usage when they go to sleep.
Monitors must power down to 15 watts or less after 15 or 30 minutes
of inactivity, then to 8 watts or less after a total of 70 minutes
of inactivity. There are similar standards for printers, fax
machines, copiers, scanners and so on.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information, check out the .pdf documents listed at
 &LR; www.epa.gov/appdstar/esoe/index.html &LR; , especially one called ``A
Buyer's Guide to Purchasing Energy Star-Compliant Office
Equipment.'')
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, EPA spokeswoman Christine Sansevero told me, about 90
percent of all new monitors sold in the United States are Energy
Star compliant. But for computers, she said, the figure is only 50
to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies offer only Energy Star systems (that seems to be
the case with Apple at the moment, though last year's
blue-and-white G3s weren't compliant), but most sell a mix of
compliant and noncompliant models; often it depends on the details
of the particular configuration you order.
</P>
<P>
   If you're buying a standard ``shrink-wrapped'' PC or peripheral
from a retail dealer, you should be able to tell whether it is
Energy Star-certified by looking for the logo on the box.
</P>
<P>
   But things get trickier if you're ordering from a catalog or the
Web, or having your system configured to order.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can tell from the tech specs most manufacturers
post on their Web sites, but the information isn't always there.
According to Brian Zucker, a technology evangelist at Dell, the
corporate side of the company maintains lists of Energy
Star-certified models, but consumers and small-businesspeople
checking out products such as the popular Dimension PC line will
find no indication as to which models and configurations are
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're careful to buy only Energy Star-certified
products, it won't do much good unless their power-saving features
are activated. Energy Star rules, according to the EPA, require
that these capabilities be enabled when the product leaves the
factory, but users can override the default settings.
</P>
<P>
   Most home users probably don't do that. But many corporate
information-technology departments replace the software preloaded
on new systems with a standard ``image'' containing licensed
applications and approved configuration settings. In this process,
according to the EPA, power-saving features are often disabled _ in
part, it seems, because years ago, when Energy Star was new, PCs
used to lose their network connections when they went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That problem has long since been corrected, but many IT
departments still disable power-saving features _ including even
monitor sleeping, which has nothing to do with network connections.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry to say that seems to be the case at The Chronicle. The
Energy Star features on all our PCs seem to be disabled, and when I
stay late or drop in on a weekend, I'm surrounded by humming PCs
and glowing CRTs.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to check your own PC's settings, there are at least
two places to do so in Windows 98: in the Power Management
properties (click the Start button, then Settings, then Control
Panel, then double-click Power Management) and in the Display
properties (same routine, except choose the Display icon in the
Control Panel window, or simply right-click on the desktop and
choose properties; either way, you should find the Energy Star
settings for your monitor by clicking on the Screen Saver tab).
</P>
<P>
   Note that even if your computer and monitor don't have an Energy
Star logo, odds are, unless they're genuine antiques, they do have
a sleep or low-power mode option, and it's worthwhile to enable it.
If it doesn't reduce power as far as the EPA program requires, it
will almost certainly cut your consumption significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ON OR OFF? That brings us to one of computing's eternal
questions: Should you shut off your computer when you're not using
it?
</P>
<P>
   This old chestnut came to my attention again back in June, even
before the California electricity crisis surfaced, when David
Einstein, author of The Chronicle's almost-weekly Computing Q&AMP;A
column, addressed a question about the risk of screen ``burn-in,''
the alleged danger that screen images could get burned permanently
into a CRT's phosphors if a monitor is left on but idle for too
long.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of arguing that modern monitors are ``practically
impervious to screen burn,'' Einstein noted that he'd had a
computer at work that he'd left on, displaying the Windows desktop,
for two whole years.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he ended his answer by suggesting that the reader
configure his or her PC to shut off the monitor after 15 or 20
minutes of inactivity, Einstein's two-year comment elicited a howl
of outrage, e-mailed to me among other journalists at The Chron and
elsewhere, from a reader signing himself
`` &LR; pups(AT)dog-patch.com. &LR; '' Leaving a computer on all the time,
pups yelped, amounted to ``wasting energy ... in the most moronic,
slothful way imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a special interest in this dispute, not only because I
consider myself an environmentalist, but also because that monitor
Einstein left on for two years is now mine. (Though he now writes
his Q&AMP;A column on a free-lance basis, he was for many years on The
Chronicle staff, and I happen to sit at the desk he used to
occupy.)
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the monitor doesn't show any sign of burn-in, but
I'm with pups on the larger issue: It simply doesn't make sense to
me to leave your PC running overnight _ especially if you don't
have Energy Star-certified equipment or have the power-saving
features disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the immediate power crunch facing California is mainly
during the workday, so I can't argue that shutting down at night
will help much with that. But electricity is electricity, whenever
it's consumed, and the more you consume, the more fossil fuel is
likely to be burned to generate it, with all the attendant
pollution and greenhouse-gas issues.
</P>
<P>
   It probably doesn't come as a surprise that the EPA sides with
pups and me on this one: ``Absolutely, no question about it, people
should shut down their office computers at the end of the day,''
Matt Haber of tHe agency's San Francisco office told me. ``In a
crisis situation (such as the hot-weather days we had last week),
it may make sense to shut down even when you leave for lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The main argument against Haber's position is the time required
for boot-up and log-in. For that reason, I haven't followed his
advice about lunch, but I have started shutting off my monitor
whenever I expect to be away from my desk for an hour or more.
Surely no one can argue that hitting a single switch is a major
burden.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly true that having to wait for my PC to start up
every morning is annoying, but here's one more argument for why
it's worth the trouble, even if you don't give a damn about the
environmental issues: When I have left a Windows system running
overnight, I've found that the odds of a crash the next day are far
higher, thanks to the ``memory leaks'' and other anomalies that
continue to plague Microsoft's operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Remember: Booting up and logging in every morning may be a pain,
but it's not half as bad as having to do so after a crash in the
middle of the day, when you lose unsaved work and have to wait for
DiskScan to run its disk-integrity checks.
</P>
<P>
   One last point on energy saving: Screen savers, whatever else
they may do, don't save energy. Your computer has to be up and
running to float the Windows logo, a flying toaster or anything
else across your screen. Depending on your software and settings, a
screen saver may even prevent your system's power-management
features from engaging when they otherwise would, negating the
effects of Energy Star compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT ONLINE: For those interested in news about the
environment, one Web site to check out is the Environmental News
Network's portal ( &LR; www.enn.com &LR; ). Much of its content is
wire-service reports and press releases from green groups, but it's
convenient to have those in one place, and the site also delivers
some interesting and apparently original features.

 AD AGENCIES EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With all of the churn in Dot-Comville,
advertising agencies that cater to Internet companies should be
suffering from headaches of their own.
</P>
<P>
   But while most San Francisco agencies have taken some hits since
the April dot-com implosion, a surprising number say they are on
track for robust growth this year, with new business coming from
both dot-coms and not-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We doubled in size last year (to $200 million) and we expect
to double again'' in 2000, said Tom Bedecarre, chairman of Citron
Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco, which specializes in
Internet-related accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all local agencies saw a dramatic slowdown in
new-business solicitations after the April meltdown in Internet
stocks, which particularly hurt sites catering to consumers. Quite
a few e-tailers lost their funding or at least put marketing
efforts on hold.
</P>
<P>
   But phones started ringing again by June, agency executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new clients are business-to-business Internet firms,
infrastructure providers and wireless communications companies. And
of course, non-tech companies continue to spend record amounts on
advertising, particularly with the Olympics coming up.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, advertising spending this year is expected to grow a
healthy 9.4 percent, according to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, a New
York ad shop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few local agencies have escaped the dot-com meltdown
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Exile on Seventh, a San Francisco firm that specializes in
online ads, just won three high-profile accounts _ eBay, Webvan and
People PC, with total annual billings estimated at $20 to $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency, whose clients are all Internet-related, recently
lost five other accounts worth about the same amount, said chief
executive Michael McMahon. ``I went on vacation in June and three
of them completely gave up while I was gone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exile's revenues will be flat for the quarter, compared with the
10 percent monthly increases it has seen in the past. ``It's not
terrible, but we're not used to having to worry about it,'' McMahon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't made our first cold call ... but we are going
to start to have to take a more proactive stance toward generating
new business,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Gardner Geary Coll has seen three dot-com
clients stop advertising altogether or ``cut way back'' since
April, said agency President Bob Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Dot-com billings have fallen to about a quarter of the agency's
total from approximately a third, Gardner estimated. Still, the
agency continues to hire more staff and he expects overall billings
to increase this year by 15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 21, which creates online campaigns for clients such as
Tupperware and Bank of America, has seen two of its 15 clients
defunded. But the agency still expects billings to grow by several
multiples over 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Much of its new business is coming from established offline
companies, such as Tupperware, that are just beginning to advertise
online, said chief executive Kate Everett-Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Lot 21 is using the April downturn to its advantage by
recruiting staff from agencies whose stocks are underwater,
Everett-Thorpe said. The agency is trying to add 100 additional
employees to its current roster of 150, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With all of the volatility, some agencies are relieved that they
didn't make an all-out push into dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either we're very smart or we're very stupid,'' said Rich
Silverstein, co-chairman of Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners, which
is known for consumer-product advertising such as the ``Got Milk?''
campaign. ``We're careful not to have one kind of industry take
over the entire agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's e-tailing clients, which include E-Trade, eLuxury
and a new client, Hotwire, are spending healthily on advertising,
Silverstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, client volatility remains an issue among not-coms as
well as dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco office of Young &AMP; Rubicam lost 25 percent of
its billings last year when its biggest client, Clorox of Oakland,
consolidated its accounts with another agency.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R expects to replace the lost revenues ``almost exclusively
with tech and dot-com clients,'' said chief executive Austin
McGhie.

BIOSCOPE: PENN STATE CHEMIST SEEKS TO PHOTOGRAPH THE
BODY'S  ELUSIVE AURA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gary Settles never uses the word ``aura'' when
he explains his work.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't think of a better term to describe his research into
the plume of airborne particles that envelopes every human body, is
invisible to the naked eye, but can be seen through a process
called schlieren photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you call it an aura, people think we're mystics,''
complained Settles, a Penn State University chemist. ``It's not a
human aura, it's just hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will, Settles has patented a device that looks
like an airport metal detector. But instead of using magnetism to
search for concealed weapons, Settles' device uses a chemical
analyzer to detect signals in this invisible cloud of hot air that
surrounds our bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Settles calls this cloud a human thermal plume. It seems that
body heat creates a convection current around us. This updraft
carries with it flecks of skin, the molecular residue of objects
we've touched, invisible bits of clothing fabric and the dust of
places where we've been.
</P>
<P>
   In short, when subjected to the proper chemical analysis, this
human thermal plume can reveal all sorts of information about what
we may have done or touched _ and perhaps even whether we are ill.
</P>
<P>
   If a person handled dynamite, for instance, molecular traces of
the explosive would adhere to the body. These trace molecules would
be swept up into the human thermal plume and detected by the
chemical analyzer in Settles' innovative device.
</P>
<P>
   The same would apply to flakes of plastic explosive, or flecks
of drugs smuggled on a person's body. Settles has already patented
his device for drug and explosive detection in airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very serious threat of terrorists carrying
explosives into the passenger compartments of airplanes,'' said
Settles, whose work thus far has been supported by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ion Track Instruments of Massachusetts is about a year away from
turning Settles' invention into a commercial product. Settles said
prototypes can do a chemical sniff test for explosives in roughly
10 seconds _ fast enough for use at busy airports.
</P>
<P>
   With the security aspects of his invention in the works, Settles
is exploring medical uses of his technology.
</P>
<P>
   He postulates that a whole range of medical conditions could be
diagnosed by his new instrument. He envisions creating a
walk-through diagnostic tool that could spot early stage diabetes,
for instance, by tuning the detector to look for acetone, a
chemical that seems to emanate from the perspiration of diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical uses could be more important in the long run than
the security application,'' he said. ``Any medical condition that
produces a chemical signal could be a candidate, and there are
probably dozens and dozens of applications that would qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   The human thermal plume was first observed shortly after World
War II, when a group of British scientists, who had wandered in
front of a special photographic apparatus, noticed that their
bodies seemed to be encased in an aura, ahem, I mean a thermal
perturbation of the air currents in proximity to their body heat.
</P>
<P>
   The process that revealed this hitherto unknown cloud was called
schlieren photography. It involved photographing a subject in front
of a parabolic mirror that bent light in such a way as to reveal
the thermal pattern formed by body heat.
</P>
<P>
   Settles, who has been interested in schlieren photography for
some 20 years, started looking into the thermal plume from body
heat, and one of the things he noticed was that it was full of
flecks of skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skin is coming off our bodies all the time,'' he said. ``We
actually shed our entire skin over a two or three day period, we
just don't shed it all at once like snakes do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Settles is convinced his device has medical
applications, he says, so far, his doctor friends have been slow to
embrace a technology that seems to have a whiff of quack science.

   MILE-HIGH COMPETITION: An economic development team from
Colorado visited the Bay Area recently, trying to drum up new
tenants for a 150-acre bioindustrial park. Colorado plans to build
this biotech center next to the campus being built to house the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado is stealing a page from San Francisco's economic
development book. A biotech ring is being planned around the new
Mission Bay campus of the University of California at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Mission Bay's commercial park is probably destined to house
research and development (R&AMP;D) offices. Colorado officials didn't
come here expecting to poach that sort of biotech startup.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Christopher Gray, business development director for the
city of Aurora, said he and his colleagues are hunting for large or
midsize firms that have grown beyond the R&AMP;D stage and are moving
into manufacturing. Such firms might be prime targets to locate
production facilities in Colorado's new bio-industrial zone to
avoid the high labor and rent costs that make manufacturing too
expensive in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has no illusions about the fact that, for now at least,
it's a bit player on the biotech stage. There are about 174 firms
in the entire state of Colorado under the broad category of life
sciences and medical devices. By contrast, the Bay Area has 747
firms in the same category.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado has had some success in siphoning off some of
California's excess growth in high tech. It has attracted satellite
plants from Bay Area giants like Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard
and Seagate Technology. Now, Colorado officials hope to convince
growing biotechnology firms that their state already knows how to
do business the California way.
</P>
<P>
   Like every other state on the prowl, Colorado has armed its
bio-prospectors with tax incentives designed to ease the cost of
hiring staff and fielding equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado also hopes that putting the University of Colorado
hospital inside the new bio-zone will help attract out-of-state
tenants, because it will assure a steady flow of people with
biomedical skills.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, several Bay Area firms have already established
satellite manufacturing centers in nearby Vacaville, Calif., to
beat the Bay Area housing prices and labor rates in a locale that's
still an easy drive from headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But Julie Bender, a business development official with Denver
International Airport, said the Bay Area is just a hop, skip and
jump from Denver's modern airport _ which, she assured me, has
ironed out the much-publicized kinks in its luggage handling
system.
</P>
<P>
   But those who do fly in to scope out the mile-high state, take
it from me: Play it safe and stick a toothbrush and change of
undies in your carry-on case.
</P>
<P>
   BORN AGAIN: There's a tale of perseverance behind the recent
reappearance on the Nasdaq of the ticker symbol for Neurobiological
Technologies (NTII).
</P>
<P>
   A little less than two years ago, when NTII was booted off the
exchange for having insufficient cash reserves, chief executive
Paul Freiman admitted that corporate death was knocking at the door
of the tiny Richmond, Calif., firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Freiman, a veteran drug industry executive and former
chairman of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association, believed
NTII had a potential winner in a drug named Memantine. It was in
late stage clinical trials of the drug that treats Alzheimer's
disease and diabetic pain. Freiman used all his contacts and skills
to sign the partnership deals that would allow the struggling
company to continue development of the drug that could make its
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It has become evident during the past few weeks that Freiman is
succeeding. At a recent national conference on Alzheimer's,
investigators at New York University said patients given Memantine
during a six-month period showed improved memory and self-care
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Memantine faces more hurdles before it can seek U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval. But based on these and other
encouraging scientific findings, Freiman has made deals that have
swelled NTII's bank account _ and paved the way for the company
return to the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   I called Freiman to discuss the company's prospects, but he was
on vacation in Rio de Janeiro and we ended up trading voice mails.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy the rest, Paul. You've earned it.

CULTURAL BARRIERS HINDER EDUCATION OF ASIAN-AMERICANS ABOUT AIDS
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The diversity of cultures and languages among
Asian-Americans may cause headaches for schoolteachers and census
takers, but rarely does it affect matters of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   One glaring exception is in the prevention and treatment of HIV
and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts needed to educate Asian-Americans, especially recent
immigrants, about the disease are greater than for any other ethnic
group, say scholars and outreach workers. That is because of the
variety of languages spoken and because of cultural beliefs that
discourage discussion about sex and death, let alone about sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that they are years and years behind in terms of how
the illness is treated and the social perceptions of the illness,''
said Dr. Ezer Kang, a clinical psychologist at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan who is studying
HIV-positive Asian-Americans. ``There's a lack of acceptance and
lack of awareness of HIV in the general community.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health agencies have not been very effective in directly
tackling these problems, and the task has been left to community
groups, said Kang and other experts. For example, two groups were
passing out fliers and condoms at a Chinatown street fair Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of knowledge about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
among many recent Asian immigrants is a problem nationwide, but is
of particular concern in New York, which has the highest number of
Asian-Americans with AIDS of any metropolitan region in the
country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. At the end of 1997, the latest year for which
information is available, they accounted for 306 out of 39,625
people with AIDS in New York. (Outreach workers say that number is
an undercount because many Asian-Americans with AIDS never report
it.)
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies also show that as an ethnic group,
Asian-Americans have the highest rate of late intervention, meaning
that patients are already infected with an AIDS-related disease by
the time they get a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study, released in February by the New York City
Department of Health, shows that of a sample of 118 people made up
mostly of Asian-Americans and a few American Indians with AIDS in
1997 and 1998, 44 percent were cases of late intervention. That is
in contrast to 28 percent for blacks, 24 percent for Hispanics and
21 percent for whites.
</P>
<P>
   The main reasons for that, experts say, are a dearth of
materials about the disease in Asian languages, an unfamiliarity on
the part of public health agencies with Asian cultures, and
cultural beliefs that may hinder an understanding of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Huang, 31, of Brooklyn, ran into that problem with his
father. ``When I told him I had AIDS, and I told him I was gay at
the same time, he said, `Well, what is that?' '' Huang said. ``I
was very angry. We still really don't talk about it much.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, federal and local governments have recognized
the need for outreach, and have given funds to most of the half
dozen or so community groups in the city that provide services to
Asian-Americans. Those groups in turn have found a need to employ
an array of strategies including handing out multilingual fliers at
street fairs and giving away condoms stuffed in envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   A top priority is to make outreach efforts specific to language
and culture. To that end, the Asian and Pacific Islander Coalition
on HIV/AIDS, known as Apicha, has 75 peer educators fluent in a
dozen languages, from Bengali to Tagalog to various Chinese
dialects. The group plans to buy multilingual subway advertisements
this fall using grant money from the city.
</P>
<P>
   Other outreach groups have made educational videotapes that show
Chinese- and Korean-Americans in dramatized situations dealing with
HIV. The actors speak in Asian languages, and the situations are
set in immigrant neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts say that merely presenting materials in
different languages isn't enough. Each culture has a different
attitude toward sex and HIV that has to be addressed individually.
</P>
<P>
   Thai immigrants, for example, are more receptive to learning
about HIV because the high rate of infection in Thailand has led to
relatively open discussion, said Prescott Chow, a program director
at the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum, based in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic Filipino-Americans often shy away from discussing
safe sex practices because of church teachings on birth control and
on abortion, said Therese Rodriguez, executive director of Apicha.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Asian immigrants come from societies that avoid open
talk about AIDS or sex. For years, the Chinese government refused
to acknowledge that AIDS existed in China. In Japan, the news media
covered the epidemic ``like witch hunting,'' and high school sex
education still revolves around ``flowers and pollen metaphors,''
said Yoshiharu Muto, a journalist based in New York who has written
about AIDS for a Tokyo newspaper and who heads the Japanese AIDS
Workshop Series.
</P>
<P>
   Apicha has found that private meetings work better than public
lectures with them, said Faraz Ahmed, a Pakistani-American outreach
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Educators talk about HIV at house parties, and Ahmed rides
around in taxis to teach drivers. Those cabbies who take customers
to sex establishments can pass on the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Chinese-American Planning Council has begun a program
to educate prostitutes in Chinatown. Many came from China or
Southeast Asian countries with no intention of becoming
prostitutes, but now work out of massage parlors or apartments to
pay debts, said ManChui Leung, an outreach director at the planning
council. The peer educators often talk to the women one on one in
their homes or where they work and accompany them to be tested for
H.I.V.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very successful program for us, but tough, because
a lot of people are undocumented,'' Leung said. ``It's tough
dealing with the police, and with a lot of the businesses shutting
down and opening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching out to church congregations can be just as difficult.
Religious beliefs _ from Islam to Catholicism _ often play a large
role in the silence surrounding sex. In Korean- and
Chinese-American communities, Christian churches would be ideal
places for HIV and AIDS outreach because they often draw recent
immigrants, but ministers rarely allow sex education in their
houses of worship, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
   Seongho Kim at Korean Community Services said many ministers had
rejected his offer to set up HIV lectures. In January, the youth
director of a church in Flushing agreed, but the minister balked.
</P>
<P>
   For Kim and many health educators, their greatest hope is that a
new generation _ liberated from the cultural beliefs that their
more traditional parents hold _ can accept and pass on these
lessons about sex, life and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to grow healthy both mentally and physically,''
Kim said. ``At the same time, I want them to keep their own
culture.''

AYATOLLAH CRUSHES PRESS REFORMS IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Adds byline, new second, third, sixth, seventh and eighth
graphs.) 
By NAZILA FATHI c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Squashing a cherished goal of President Mohammad
Khatami and his reformist allies, Iran's supreme religious leader
Sunday sided conclusively with the country's conservatives and
ordered the Parliament to scrap a bill aimed at restoring a free
and lively press.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise intervention by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
country's top Muslim cleric, stunned reformers who had hoped to use
their newly won strength in Parliament to revive the once vigorous
liberal press.
</P>
<P>
   When Khamenei's decision was announced, the chamber erupted in
loud arguments and scuffles. Sixty reformist members of the
290-seat Parliament walked out in protest.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law to liberalize the press was the centerpiece of
Khatami's reform program for the new Parliament and followed many
months during which liberal newspapers had been shut down and their
editors and writers jailed. The 22nd newspaper was closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary showdown was a decisive moment in the struggle
between liberal and conservative forces that has simmered in the
three years since the reform-minded president was swept to power on
an electoral landslide generated largely by a youthful electorate
that has come of age since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Friction between the two camps increased with the victory of
reform politicians in parliamentary elections six months ago. In
response to the recent crackdown, reform leaders had urged their
supporters to be patient, promising that the new Parliament would
overturn the press and social restrictions enacted by its
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   They said their chief aim was to pass a new press law that would
permit a resumption of the lively public debate and investigative
journalism that had flowered under Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   In refusing to permit the bill to be debated or voted on,
Khamenei took the exceptional action of circumventing the normal
institutional checks on legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian Parliament, while directly elected, is relatively
weak. Any law it passes must be approved by the Council of
Guardians, a conservative clerical body. A law rejected by the
council can then be appealed by the Parliament to another group,
the Expediency Council, which is also dominated by hard-liners.
Only then _ at least until Sunday _ did the supreme leader
intervene to make a final decision about the constitutionality of a
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Khamenei, who owes his position to the powerful
religious hierarchy, had succeeded in appearing to give a little
support to each side of the political divide.
</P>
<P>
   He has effusively praised the president as a good Muslim who is
a true heir to the values of the Islamic Revolution. In late May,
just days before the new Parliament was to open, he pressured the
Council of Guardians to end its long delay in certifying the
reformists' election victory in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   But Khamenei has also provided ammunition to hard-liners,
endorsing their judicial crackdown on the pro-Khatami press and
labeling reformers as hirelings of foreign powers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to the Parliament and read out in the chambers
Sunday, the ayatollah said he considered the proposed new press law
a threat to the fundamental pillars of the clergy-run system in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be great danger to the national security and people's
faith if the enemies of the Islamic Revolution control or
infiltrate the press,'' he wrote. ``The present press law has
prevented such disaster so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The press law now in effect gives the courts, which are
dominated by conservatives, the power to close newspapers summarily
and to control who owns or works for them. It was passed in the
waning days of the previous Parliament, which was controlled by
religious hard-liners opposed to Khatami's program of social
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed press law, drafted by one of Khatami's government
ministries, would have restored some independence for media and
required hearings before juries before the closing of any
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Mehdi Karrubi, the Parliament speaker, said Khamenei, who has
held his post since 1988, had the constitutional power to order the
lawmakers to stop consideration of a bill. The system, he said, is
based on submission to the ``absolute rule of the supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   That view, however, was disputed by reformist members of the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision should have been put to a vote,'' said Ali
Tajernia, a reformist Parliamentarian.
</P>
<P>
   Once the letter was read, the room erupted in shouts and some
members began shoving each other. In the heat of the moment, one
reformer, Mohammad Rashidian, ignored religious and political
protocol by referring to the supreme leader simply as ``Khamenei,''
without an honorific. He was immediately condemned by conservative
members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what effect today's move by the ayatollah might
have. Since the closure of most reformist newspapers, leaders of
the pro-Khatami camp have pleaded for public calm in the face of
the crackdown by conservatives. Last month, however, angry students
demonstrated in front of the Parliament, calling for change.
</P>
<P>
   Hamidreza Jalaipour, who helped found and run five different
now-banned daily newspapers, said journalists still had no choice
other than caution. But he said new publications would continue to
appear in an effort to test the boundaries of political freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result will be that newspapers and journals will continue
to publish under new licenses and different names every time they
are shut down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some reform members said they held out hope that Khamenei could
be convinced to change his mind. Fathimeh Haghighatjoo, a
representative from Tehran, said reformers were planning to write
to the leader to explain why a more unfettered press would be
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can solve obstacles such as what happened Sunday
if we have closer ties with the leader,'' she said. ``The problem
is that the constitution is vague when it explains the duties of
the Parliament and the supreme leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system put in place after the Iranian monarchy was
uprooted by the Islamic revolution, the supreme leader controls the
military, security, courts and all broadcast media in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Only the president, the Parliament and some municipal councils
are elected.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness, the elegant and versatile British actor known
to older audiences for films like ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
and to a whole new generation for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars,'' died late Saturday at a hospital in West Sussex,
England. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing a plain-as-porridge but chameleonlike face, Guinness
was one of those gifted actors who left audiences awed with his
seemingly effortless, perfect performances, which he carried off
with quiet subtlety and undemonstrative skill.
</P>
<P>
   Although his notable career encompassed the stage and
television, it was in motion pictures that a much wider audience
found Guinness unforgettable almost from the moment he first
appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   He was a most versatile performer, capable of playing a wide
range of roles, beginning in 1946, when he was Herbert Pocket in
the movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations.'' He
delighted millions with his wittily etched, tour-de-force
delineations of 10 members of an eccentric English family
(including a spinster and a character in an oil painting) in ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' in 1949. And he developed a cult following
for his merry antics in ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' and ``The
Captain's Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most memorable dramatic roles was the driven
regimental colonel in postwar Scotland in ``Tunes of Glory.'' And
another military role, as the slightly mad military prig of a
colonel in ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, won him an
Academy Award. He was knighted in the late 1950s by Queen
Elizabeth, but still had a long career ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was often said that as a master of disguise he was
an actor with no face of his own, it was, in fact, the intelligent
use of his malleable features that served him so extraordinarily
well. In situations where lesser performers required several lines
of dialogue to accomplish an effect, Guinness used his own facial
shorthand _ the faint curling of a lip, a seemingly apologetic
furrowing of the brow, the quizzical upturn of an eyebrow, the
slight but visible widening of the eyes in disbelief, a sudden
brief smile that could radiate approval or signify chilly disdain.
Particularly in motion-picture close-up, he did not so much act as
allow his face to react to what another actor was saying.
</P>
<P>
   He was the antithesis of the personality player or star, for he
accepted small and large roles that ranged from the starkly
dramatic to the predictably melodramatic to the maniacally
whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done has been on the spur of the moment,'' the
actor said some years ago. ``That's why my career has been so
haphazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Haphazard or not, it was a notable career, one in which Guinness
triumphed in the theater in roles as startlingly dissimilar as
Hamlet and the suave psychiatrist in T.S. Eliot's ``Cocktail
Party.'' He was the drink-sodden and doomed Welsh poet Dylan Thomas
in Sidney Michaels' biographical drama ``Dylan'' and the tragically
broken and brainwashed prelate in ``The Cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played a Japanese businessman in ``A Majority of One''
in 1962, the same year that he was seen as the Arab prince, Feisal,
in ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and Hitler in ``Hitler: The Last 10
Days.'' He had business savvy as well _ for his memorable role in
the 1977 blockbuster ``Star Wars,'' he received a percentage of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was born in London on April 2, 1914. He was often
mistaken for one of the ``brewery Guinnesses,'' he said, and in his
adulthood several members of that family of millionaires cultivated
his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``Blessings in Disguise,'' published in
the United States in 1986, Guinness cleared up longtime speculation
as to whether he was an illegitimate child. He was indeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth certificate registers me as Alec Guinness de Cuffe,''
he wrote. ``My mother at the time was a Miss Agnes Cuffe; my
father's name is left an intriguing, speculative blank. When I was
five years old my mother married an army captain, a Scot named
David Stiven, and from then until I left preparatory school I was
known as Alec Stiven (a name I rather liked, although I hated and
dreaded my stepfather).''
</P>
<P>
   His mother's ``violently unhappy marriage'' lasted only three
years, ending when Stiven was posted to New Zealand, Guinness said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pembroke Lodge, a boarding school, the headmaster discouraged
the youth from student theatricals by telling him, ``You're not the
acting type,'' but later, at Roborough School in Eastbourne, he won
the role of the breathless messenger in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The skinny, wild-eyed boy prepared for his bit part the night of
the performance by running around the football field twice, timing
himself to dash through the auditorium's side door and run onstage
at the moment of his cue (``Enter a Messenger'') and collapse in
front of Macbeth. ``Gracious,'' he genuinely gasped, ``my lord
(gulp!), I should report (gasp!) that which I ...'' The schoolboy
audience burst into applause, and that night an actor was born.
</P>
<P>
   His schooling finished in 1932, he went to work as an apprentice
copywriter in a London advertising agency. ``The very first thing I
did was on impulse to phone Martita Hunt and ask her to give me
acting lessons,'' he recalled years later. ``After a few lessons
she sent me packing.'' In fact, after 12 lessons, Hunt, a renowned
actress who later played Habersham with him in ``Great
Expectations,'' told the drab and emaciated young man in 1933,
``You'll never make an actor, Mr. Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the would-be actor applied to the Fay Compton
Studio of Dramatic Art, which gave him a modest scholarship, and he
was able to study and live on a single baked-beans-on-toast meal a
day. He went to classes but augmented his training by following
Londoners about, mimicking their gait, their traits and their
gestures _ all of which would be put to good use in a brilliant
career to come.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he found the studio tiresome. ``We did
dancing and singing in the mornings,'' he recalled later. ``Tap
dancing was very much in vogue then so I'm afraid we did an awful
lot of that. In the afternoons it was drama, and I remember we were
taught that there was a correct and an incorrect way of executing
the most detailed stage business.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness left the Compton Studio after seven months, but not
before an annual recital at which the judges, John Gielgud among
them, awarded him a major prize. In the years to come he was to
refer often to the older actor as ``the great hero of my youth,''
and in fact on more than one occasion the older man helped him
along in his career, encouraging him and offering him money when he
needed it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, literally a starving young actor, Guinness got work in
a lurid shipboard melodrama called ``Queer Cargo,'' in which he
played three small roles. Then Gielgud gave him his first big
break, casting him as Osric and the Third Player in the Gielgud
production of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My theater tide began to come in because of Sir John's
generosity, for from that point on I was never truly out of a job
unless I wanted it that way,'' Guinness recalled in 1982. He was
from the start a sort of critics' darling _ one called his Osric in
``Hamlet'' an ``admirable popinjay,'' and later his Sir Andrew
Aguecheek in ``Twelfth Night'' was pronounced ``a collector's
item.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 24 he played his first Hamlet in a Tyrone Guthrie
production at the Old Vic, and although it was, on the whole, an
ego-chastening experience, one critic kindly conceded that if the
young actor's Hamlet was short on force, his performance was
``touched with sweetness and an aching sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his apprenticeship under John Gielgud, whose London company
he had joined in 1937, Guinness said, ``Working with him in the
'30s was a great and good discipline because his precision demanded
the same from you.'' And, he said: ``Going into Tyrone Guthrie
productions on the other hand was a great liberating influence. He
could relax you as an actor where Gielgud could make you feel
stiff. I was extraordinarily fortunate to be oscillating between
these opposite poles.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, a quietly modest man known for his unelaborate
courtesy, was equally grateful to others in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martita Hunt had been the first truly sophisticated person I
had met, and she developed in me a sense of taste,'' he said in an
interview. ``So did Edith Evans, from whom I learnt things of value
technically.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a producer and later director at the Old Vic, he
said, ``Michel Saint-Denis, on the other hand, woke me up to what
theater was really all about and was the first person to give me a
sense of reality for the words I was speaking. Gielgud, Guthrie,
Martita Hunt, Edith Evans, Michel Saint-Denis _ they were the
formative people in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before enlisting in the Royal Navy in 1941, the actor had
learned many lessons well, having played 34 parts in 23 plays by
Shakespeare, Pinero, Chekhov, Shaw and Sheridan. ``It was
obvious,'' Tyrone Guthrie said about that period, ``that he was
going to be tremendously talented. It was not so obvious that he
was going to be so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' ``war'' was distinguished only by an incident that
might have made a vignette in a Guinness comedy. In the invasion of
Sicily, the actor-turned-landing-craft-skipper was actually the
first person ashore, a nonheroic deed of derring-don't blamed
entirely on an hour's error in orders. When the admiral in charge
blustered his way ashore at last, the young Guinness is said to
have blandly assured him that such tardy timing of an entrance
would never be tolerated in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   On being mustered out, he resumed his writing and stage career
in the role of Mitya in his own version of Dostoyevski's ``Brothers
Karamazov,'' an artistic success that failed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   His other stage appearances in the postwar period included roles
in Sartre's ``Vicious Circle,'' the Dauphin in Shaw's ``Saint
Joan'' and the title role in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' Of the
last, the critic for The Sunday Express of London wrote: `` Mr.
Guinness is slight, with an interesting angular face and a clear,
flexible voice. He has dignity, but no majesty; he has range and
control, but no surprises. He is intensely good without being great
_ yet. His future may bring that.''
</P>
<P>
   Having played so many classical roles, Guinness decided it was
time to tackle the movies, commenting, ``On the stage I never seem
to have a chance to wear trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been an extra in his first movie, ``Evensong,'' in 1934,
and remembered it as ``a horrible experience.'' But in 1946, the
director David Lean cast him as Pocket in the now-classic film
version of ``Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Lean allowed him to play an extremely wicked Fagin in a
controversial version of ``Oliver Twist,'' whose release in the
United States was held up for more than two years because of
pressure brought by groups that considered the Guinness
characterization anti-Semitic. The U.S. version was also censored,
but among moviegoers worldwide, Alec Guinness had clinched his
claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Now much in demand on the screen, in 1949 he made ``A Run for
Your Money'' and ``Kind Hearts and Coronets''; in the latter, he
played several members of a dotty family who fall prey to a
murderous relative. It was that set of performances that forever
sealed the actor's reputation as a rubber-faced British zany in the
tradition of Sir Harry Lauder. He was thenceforth to be hailed as
the actor who could play any part.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he also created the role of the seemingly omniscient
psychiatrist in T.S. Eliot's ``Cocktail Party'' at the Edinburgh
Festival, and the following year went with it to Broadway, where
his performance bowled over critics and audiences alike.
</P>
<P>
   His first films were making him famous and moderately wealthy,
but he fancied himself rather a tragedian than a comedian and, once
more, in 1951, assayed ``Hamlet'' on the West End, directing the
play himself and presenting the tragic Dane as cold, existential
and matter of fact. The flop, which he was to brood over for years,
propelled him more and more into movies.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1950s films he was a shrewdly wary Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli in ``The Mudlark''; a droopy-lidded, bowlered and
bespectacled bank clerk who engineers the smuggling of a hoard of
gold bullion out of England in ``The Lavender Hill Mob''; and, in
``The Man in the White Suit,'' a chemist single-mindedly devoted to
developing a miracle fabric that would never soil or wear out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet another choice comedy role came in 1953 in ``The Captain's
Paradise,'' when he played a Mediterranean ferryboat skipper who
commutes between wives as well as ports. Audiences found him less
appealing in the serious role of a love-smitten flier in ``The
Malta Story'' (1954), but delighted in his sly, quietly mirthful
charm as G.K. Chesterton's priestly sleuth Father Brown in ``The
Detective,'' also in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came ``The Ladykillers'' in 1955, closely followed by
his first Hollywood film, a glossily cold remake of Molnar's ``The
Swan'' in which he starred with Grace Kelly. Unlike many of his
compatriots who despised Hollywood, Guinness said, ``I found it
warm in every way, and would have stayed on had there been work for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his greatest film triumph, ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,''
Guinness was called upon to be ``both admirable and tiresome,'' he
said, as the fascinatingly paradoxical Colonel Nicholson, a British
officer interned in a hellish Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in
Burma. He made Nicholson at times infuriating, at times pitiable, a
man whose strict adherence to an old-fashioned code of military
ethics was both his scourge and his moral salvation.
</P>
<P>
   His next film, ``All at Sea,'' was a light change of pace in
which he played a mal de mer-prone descendant of a long line of
naval heroes, the sort of role the actor could by then play in his
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Such could not be said of his full- rounded portrayal of Gulley
Jimson in ``The Horse's Mouth,'' a Swiftian satire in which he was
an unkempt old rogue of a painter so obsessed by his art that he
had no regard for the feelings or needs of anyone who dared impinge
on his creativity. Guinness received an Academy Award nomination,
not for his acting, which was splendid, but for the screenplay he
wrote from the novel by Joyce Cary.
</P>
<P>
   Other film roles included ``The Comedians,'' ``The Quiller
Memorandum,'' ``A Christmas Carol'' and Franco Zeffirelli's
``Brother Sun, Sister Moon,'' none of which reversed the descending
trend of the actor's film fortunes in the early 1970s. In 1976,
however, he easily stole all his scenes in Neil Simon's ``Murder by
Death,'' a mystery spoof in which he played a blind butler Although
films occupied most of his time, Guinness did not entirely desert
the stage. He opened Canada's Shakespeare Festival in Stratford,
Ontario, in 1953, appearing as ``Richard III.'' In London the
following year he was praised for his harrowing performance in
``The Prisoner,'' Bridget Boland's intense study of the
brainwashing of a Roman Catholic cardinal in an Iron-Curtain
country. (He made the film version in 1955.) He was also seen
onstage as a would-be adulterer in Feydeau's ``Hotel Paradiso'' in
1956 and in 1960 had the title role in Terence Rattigan's ``Ross,''
a portrait of the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest success on Broadway came in 1964, when Peter
Glenville prodded him into taking the tricky and difficult title
role in ``Dylan,'' an anecdotal drama dealing with the
self-destructive poet Dylan Thomas' last liquor-sodden months.
Guinness was the antithesis in character of the Welsh poet, but he
gave a performance so heartwrenchingly sad that he won almost every
available acting prize that season. The critic Walter Kerr termed
the performance ``mesmerizing,'' adding, ``There is a still center
in the actor, a coal in the ashes that defies us to will our eyes
away.'' (Years later, commenting on a trifling play superbly acted
by Guinness in London, Kerr, not content with the title Queen
Elizabeth II had conferred on the actor, dubbed him ``St. Alec.'')
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' appearances on television were rare but memorable. His
most notable achievement was the character of George Smiley, the
retired British intelligence officer he created in two multipart
series seen in Britain and the United States in the early 1980s _
``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ``Smiley's People,'' written
by John le Carre. His understated characterization of the aging,
spiritually burnt-out and forlorn former spy underscored his
reputation as ``an actor who makes you forget that he is acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his acting technique, Kenneth Tynan, the late critic, writer
and director, once said: ``My point is that the people Guinness
plays best are all iceberg characters, nine-tenths concealed, whose
fascination lies not in how they look but in how their minds work.
The parts he plays are, so to speak, injected hypodermically, not
tattooed all over him; the latter is the star's way, and Guinness
shrinks from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor was mildly amused by such esoteric analyses of his
art. ``I have no ax to grind, and no interesting theories to
propound,'' he said. ``If a play comes my way which appeals to me
and which I am free to do, I do it. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, one sort of script he avoided, the sort
proffered with the assurance, ``It was written just for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I was a little abrupt recently with a producer who
sent me a screenplay,'' he once confessed. ``It was rubbish,
really. I sent it back with a polite rejection. Then he came back
with the plea that `we tailored it just for you.' I replied simply,
`But no one came to take the measurements.'''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, who had been almost bald since his late 20s, was often
described as ``dignified'' and ``shy'' and ``quiet, unassuming.''
He lived modestly in an unpretentious house in Hampshire, in the
south of England, with his wife, Merula Salaman, a former actress.
They were married in 1938 when both were appearing as animals in
John Gielgud's production of ``Noah.'' They had a son, Matthew.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the makeshift stage of an art gallery in
Manhattan, a hobbled woman with thick glasses confronts a
swaggering, foul-mouthed bully with arguments about why he should
not rob her.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, is poor, she cries, and she will be forced to abandon
her beloved house for a dreaded nursing home if she is robbed yet
again. Ranting and just as desperate, the robber responds that he
needs her money because it will be his ticket out of a homeless
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The audience, some 50 people in casual clothes, is mesmerized,
and it audibly boils with anger when the robber, discovering that
the old lady has only pennies in her purse, runs off with her
prized statue of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   The play ends with that harsh scene, and the audience, mostly
nurses' aides, hospital technicians and nursing-home workers,
showers the two actors with flowers. The 53-year-old actress who
played the elderly woman is a hospital orderly, a union organizer
played the robber, and a retired hospital social worker wrote the
play to bring home the cruelty of not thinking of the hardships of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by a labor union, the play is a throwback to another
era when the United States had a thriving cultural movement, pushed
by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and many writers, artists and
performers, that sought to bring art to the common man.
</P>
<P>
   The union that sponsored the play, 1199 New York's giant union
of health-care workers, remains one of the last and foremost
practitioners of this ebbing movement from another era. And Moe
Foner, the man who presides over 1199's cultural activities,
certainly stretches back as far as that. Now 85, he was organizing
cabarets and jazz events for a department-store union in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, when much of the news from the art world is of
multimillion-dollar sales and museum admission fees can be $10,
Foner, as head of 1199's Bread and Roses cultural program,
continues to plunge ahead with his decades-old project of bringing
art to the masses. In this way he shares the vision championed by
the Works Progress Administration and private, nonprofit groups
like the Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   While some union leaders have a vision limited to whether they
can get a 3 percent or 3.5 percent wage increase, Foner insisted on
having an art gallery built at 1199's headquarters. He has had
Milton Glaser design union posters and has roped in Alan Alda,
Harry Belafonte, Woody Guthrie and Sidney Poitier to perform.
</P>
<P>
   In a highlight from the 10 exhibitions that Bread and Roses
organizes each year, he once commissioned 30 prominent artists,
including Ralph Fasanella, Sue Coe, and Jacob Lawrence, to do
work-related paintings for an exhibition, ``Images of Labor,''
which toured the United States, Italy, France and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to bring the arts, meaning culture, to working
people, to bring a culture that reflects their lives and that will
help bring their lives to a higher level,'' said Foner, who has
been called the Sol Hurok of the labor movement. ``It helps create
a sense of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his three brothers, sons of a seltzer delivery man, are
from a family that is famous on the nation's left. In addition to
being blacklisted, they all became luminaries: Philip became a
leading labor historian, Jack was a respected author on
African-American history, and Henry became president of the
furriers union.
</P>
<P>
   In running Bread and Roses, Moe Foner has also tried to improve
the image of labor unions and help members identify more closely
with them and feel prouder of their work lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that it's important that the public and even our
members understand the dignity of work, that working people do make
a contribution, that they're not the schlumps that many people
think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Facing his desk is a Ralph Fasanella poster of New York's
skyline, and on his office bookshelves stand wax candles that are
caricatures of President Richard Nixon and Vice President Spiro
Agnew. (Foner was on Nixon's enemies list for organizing labor
efforts against the Vietnam War.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Moe Foner brings a vision and a vitality that you don't see
much anymore,'' said Maxine Greene, philosopher in residence at the
Lincoln Center Institute for the Arts and Education. ``The WPA and
some theater groups represented real Rooseveltian values about the
arts, but they've largely been dropped.'' Bread and Roses, she
said, is part of ``a tradition that connects workers and art and
music into a kind of communion.''
</P>
<P>
   With health problems mounting, Foner has given some of his
duties to Esther Cohen, the creative director of Bread and Roses.
</P>
<P>
   While Foner emphasized having musicians and artists bring
culture to the union, Cohen has focused more on programs in which
members of 1199, part of the Service Employees International Union,
create and perform themselves, viewing that as a route to personal
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Each month the union sponsors a cabaret act at the art gallery,
where hospital workers read their poetry, sing hip-hop songs and
play instruments. Week after week, Bread and Roses, with the help
of state subsidies, sends music and theater groups to perform in
hospitals and nursing homes at lunchtime. And Cohen teaches a
creative writing course to 15 hospital workers. Their best short
stories are published in the union's magazine.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Kendall, a nurses' aide who cleans rooms and delivers
food to patients at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, loves the
writing course and the other art programs. ``I look at it as being
a seasoning in my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The program _ with a staff of four and a $400,000 annual budget,
half coming from foundations and government _ has also played an
unabashed role in keeping the nation's left-leaning cultural
tradition alive. It has sponsored memorial concerts for Paul
Robeson, introduced Pete Seeger to younger generations and
sponsored dramatic productions on the civil rights movement that
Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee have written and performed.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the few conservative arts critics who know
about Bread and Roses _ they usually circulate in a different orbit
_ have occasionally ridiculed its activities as propaganda or as
schmaltz.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton Kramer, the conservative art critic, said that from the
little he knew about Bread and Roses, its efforts were
crowd-pleasing political art and not serious art.
</P>
<P>
   Some people on the left have their own set of frustrations about
Bread and Roses, regretting that it always remained on the margins
of mainstream culture and never lived up to their hopes that it
would become a loud and prominent voice with a profound influence
in New York and the nation. This, its supporters say, would be
difficult, given its backing by a single union, and the declining
power and visibility of unions and the left in general.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps its biggest success has been a poster series called
``Women of Hope.'' It started in 1994 with a dozen posters called
``African-American Women of Hope,'' featuring the poet Maya
Angelou, the novelists Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, and the
social crusaders Marian Wright Edelman and Ida Wells-Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   The posters were first exhibited at 1199 and in New York City's
subways, but they now line the walls of thousands of schools, union
halls, nonprofit organizations and shelters for battered women.
Many schools have bought the posters to promote role models for
female students, and a 64-page teaching guide accompanies the
posters.
</P>
<P>
   The series has been followed by others on Latina, Native
American and Asian-American women. The most recent series,
``International Women of Hope,'' featuring Aung San Suu Kyi, the
Burmese human-rights crusader, and Graca Machel, a literacy
advocate from Mozambique, is displayed in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Bread and Roses sponsored an exhibition in which 30
high school students around New York City created photographs,
paintings, masks and collages on the theme ``Why Unions Matter.''
It included a collage about the lives of underpaid supermarket
deliverymen, photos of sweatshop workers and a painting of
sugar-refinery workers out on strike for over a year.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rivera, president of 1199/SEIU, the New York Health and
Human Service Union, has drawn much attention to his union, which
has 200,000 members, often for negotiating contracts with job
guarantees and benefits for workers near the bottom of the ladder.
But he has not stinted in supporting Foner's initiatives. ``As the
saying goes,'' he said, ``We want bread and roses, too.''

CATSKILLS CASINO PLANS FOUNDER AMIDST BROKEN DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLES V. BAGLI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four months after the federal Interior Department approved plans
for an Indian casino in Monticello, N.Y., various developers and
tribes are battling to bring gambling to the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, none of the partnerships between the developers
and the tribes have been approved by the Interior Department. And,
after decades of futility, many proponents are becoming
increasingly worried that their best shot at bringing casinos to
the Catskills may be on the brink of slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the window of opportunity is closing,'' said Anthony
P. Cellini, supervisor of the Town of Thompson in Sullivan County.
``I think people are getting sick and tired of being promised
something that comes and goes, comes and goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents were counting on casinos to provide thousands of
jobs and bring back the tourists who until the 1970s used to flock
to the now crumbling hotels and bungalow colonies scattered across
the wooded mountains. With the prospect of gambling, politically
connected developers have been buying property in the area in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the Interior Department approved a four-year-old
proposal by the St. Regis Mohawks and a company, Catskill
Development, to build a $500 million casino on 30 acres at
Monticello Raceway, about 90 miles northwest of New York City.
Although casinos are illegal in New York, a federal law would
permit gambling on sovereign Indian land.
</P>
<P>
   But eight days after gaining federal approval, the Mohawk tribal
council spurned Catskill Development and signed a secret agreement
with Arthur M. Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place
Entertainment, the world's largest casino company. The tribe
granted Park Place the rights to develop and manage tribal casinos
in New York in return for a $3 million loan for the Mohawks' small,
nearly bankrupt casino on the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg then announced plans to build a huge casino-resort with
the Mohawks at the old Kutsher's resort, about five miles away from
the racetrack, but soon discovered that he could not simply
transfer the federal approval from the racetrack to Kutsher's.
Federal officials said it would take more than two years for a new
application to wend its way through the approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Furious about the last-minute sabotage, Robert A. Berman and the
other partners in Catskill Development refused to meet with
Goldberg, leaving one side with an approved site and the other with
an approved tribe. In May, Gov. George E. Pataki, whose approval is
needed for any Indian casino deal, said he would not make a
decision on the Sullivan County proposal until the dust cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side has something the other needs,'' Sen. Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. ``I'm trying to get both sides together. My
goal is to bring gaming to this area, which needs it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another proposal surfaced recently about 10 miles south of
Monticello in Mamakating, where a group has been quietly
negotiating to build a casino-resort on a 720-acre parcel owned by
Crescent Heights Investments, a development company. According to
two people involved in the talks, Crescent Heights has been meeting
with David Flaum, a developer from Rochester, and Len Wolman,
managing partner of a gambling company owned in part by Sun
International, about building a casino-resort with the
Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans. The tribal band, which is
based in Wisconsin, has a 24,000-acre land claim in central New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal got a warm reception from officials in Mamakating,
but the prospective partners hit a snag in mid-July. The three
sides resumed negotiations recently but may work with a different
tribe. One person involved in the project said MGM, another
gambling company, had expressed interest in a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Local political leaders say they now fear that the prospects for
a casino are dimming. Politicians in Albany are expected to
resubmit a bill requiring legislative approval of any Indian
casino, making any gambling project, proponents said, highly
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Goldberg has spent an enormous amount of time
successfully convincing officials like Cellini, Schumer and Pomeroy
that he truly intends to build a major resort.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, in turn, met for months with leaders of the Cayuga
tribe, which has a 64,000-acre land claim in central New York,
about building a casino at the track. Both parties talked with John
F. O'Mara, Pataki's chief negotiator on Indian land claims, and
tthe outline of a deal came together: The state would give the
Cayugas $130 million to settle their land claims and allow the
tribe to buy about 10,000 acres in their ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki administration would also approve a Cayuga casino at
Monticello Raceway, while the tribe agreed to revenue-sharing and
to work out a tax arrangement. But shortly before the Cayugas went
back to court in Syracuse on July 17 for their land claim, state
officials suddenly broke off all contact. A jury already awarded
the tribe $37 million in damages and Judge Neal McCurn is now
determining whether to increase the award to as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal was done,'' said Martin Gold, a lawyer for the
Cayugas, ``but it's nowhere now. The state walked away.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Goldberg has told local officials that he would
be able to obtain federal approval within 11 months for a proposal
to transfer land at the Kutsher's resort to the Mohawks for a $500
million to $750 million resort and casino on 66 acres, Cellini
said. But federal officials said it was unlikely that Park Place's
application would be completed within a year. ``That's optimistic
and not in keeping with our previous record on these matters,''
said Kevin Gover, the assistant secretary for Indian affairs at the
Interior Department. ``Traditionally, it's taken two to three years
on a new application.''
</P>
<P>
   The project could lose momentum during that time, so Schumer,
Cellini and Goldberg have prevailed on Berman's group to sit down
with Park Place officials to work out a deal for at least a
temporary casino at the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hoping that the two parties can find a way to
resolve their differences and move forward with a project at the
Monticello Raceway,'' Pomeroy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Bernstein, a partner in Catskill Development, said
that even if his group did agree to meet with Goldberg, there was
no way that they could trust the man who he said had stolen their
project. If they do not work out a deal with another tribe, he
said, Catskill Development will sue Park Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our case against Park Place is worth more than a casino,''
Bernstein said. ``We either get the Cayugas or go to court. There's
no way you can do a deal with a guy who stabbed you in the back.''

   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   For decades, hundreds of thousands of frail older Americans have
suffered unnecessary neglect, injury, abuse, malnutrition and even
death while in the paid care of licensed nursing homes. Congress
and the states have passed laws in response, and the federal
government, which spends $39 billion a year on nursing home care,
has subjected the industry to a complex web of regulations, annual
inspections and an exhaustive reporting system designed to govern
the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress has never established how many nurses and nurses'
aides are needed to give adequate _ much less good _ care for the
number of residents in a home, and it has never required
substantial training or competitive wages for the aides.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Congress asked the executive branch to report by 1992
whether there should be a defined ratio of staff to patients in
nursing homes, but it was not until 1997 that the study got
priority, and not until 11 days ago _ in a labor market grown so
tight that 41 states have reported that nursing homes cannot hire
or retain the staff they need _ that the Health Care Financing
Administration finally delivered draft copies to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The study, of 1,800 nursing homes in New York, California and
Ohio, determined that conditions like bedsores, malnutrition and
weight loss increase when staffing falls below a certain level.
Fifty-four percent of nursing homes do not meet minimally adequate
staff levels, and 92 percent have less staff than necessary to give
optimal care.
</P>
<P>
   The facilities with the highest staff levels and wages are the
nonprofit homes. The ones with the lowest ratios and wages are the
for-profit homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which has made a serious effort in
the last several years to regulate nursing homes and crack down on
abusers, has now given Congress a report that makes the case for a
new definition of acceptable care for older Americans. Achieving
competent levels of care could mean huge increases in staffing and
staff expense for nursing homes, requiring greater government
financing. Each nursing home has a different mix of residents, with
different infirmities and different needs for care.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive overhaul of the system should wait a year for
the study to complete its second phase: the construction of
formulas to suggest what staff ratios are appropriate for different
caseloads in different homes. But Congress should in this session
restore some of the Medicare money that it cut from nursing homes
three years ago, and it can endorse the concept of tying such money
to staff ratios in nursing homes.

IT'S DOWN TO THE WIRE ON GORE RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAG HARBOR, N.Y. _ Monday is shaping up to be a long, tortuous
one for those on Al Gore's short list for a running mate, as the
vice president appears ready to work right up against his
self-imposed deadline to pick the person who will complete the
Democratic presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Gore huddled in Nashville Sunday with family members, search
committee chief Warren Christopher, and key campaign aides to
winnow the field, but aides said the vice president is likely to
take until late Monday, perhaps even until early Tuesday morning,
to make his final decision.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking official in the Gore campaign said the list had
been narrowed to three: Senators John F. Kerry, 57, of
Massachusetts, John Edwards, 48, of North Carolina, and Joseph I.
Lieberman, 59, of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was on the shuttle to Washington Sunday, when his cell
phone rang at 4:59 p.m., causing the senator, who had been reading
a newspaper, nearly to jump out of his seat.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't ``THE call,'' Kerry told the Globe, but someone from
the Gore campaign saying the vice president was going to ``sleep on
the decision overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Gore campaign was insisting Gore would ponder the
question up until almost the last minute, Kerry hinted a decision
might come earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I 'm sure you all will have a pretty good sense of this pretty
quickly,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and those helping him choose a running mate refused to
discuss specific candidates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't decided yet. I have not decided yet, but I will
shortly,'' Gore told supporters who gave an aggregate $250,000 to
the Democratic National Committee at a private fund-raiser Sunday
in the Long Island resort town of Southhampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say we're coming to the end of the road,'' Christopher
told reporters as he entered the meeting with Gore in Nashville
later Sunday afternoon. ``We're trying to do it in a professional
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said ``there is no firm timetable in
place,'' and said a decision definitely would not be reached
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore may ``make the calls'' as late as the wee hours of Monday
morning, giving the vice-presidential pick barely enough time to
fly to Nashville for the official announcement, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about being a leading contender, Kerry said,
``I'm honored to be there, and I like the company, and he's got a
decision to make, and I respect that.'' Asked what he would do if
he did get a call from Gore, the senator laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it depends on what he says,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in on the meeting Sunday were Gore's brother-in-law,
Frank Hunger, Christopher and several high-ranking campaign aides.
Gore's wife, Tipper, planned to attend the meeting but flight
delays made her participation uncertain. Mrs. Gore ``is his top
adviser,'' Lehane said. Although her opinion will carry substantial
weight, ``ultimately, it is his decision,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Officially still in the mix besides Kerry, Lieberman and Edwards
are Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, New Hampshire Governor Jeanne
Shaheen and House minority leader Richard A. Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   But Bayh's star has fallen, a senior Gore campaign official
said, and both Gephardt and Shaheen have said they don't want the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has made coy mention of an ``out-of-the-box,'' wild
card candidate, whom he refuses to name.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry was described by the senior campaign official as the
safest bet for Gore, but there appeared to be increasing interest
in the young senator from North Carolina, Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The primary criticism of Edwards is that he has little
experience, having spent less than two years in the Senate.
Edwards' main detractors are members of the Washington
establishment who don't know him, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is very impressed with Edwards, and the campaign
believes the senator's presence on the ticket could put several
southern states in play for the Democrats, including Edwards' home
state of North Carolina. Edwards could help in Georgia, which has
suddenly become competitive because of a hot Senate race involving
the newly appointed Democrat, former governor Zell Miller, as well
as in Louisiana, Tennessee, and Arkansas, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Democrats believe they are trailing in every
Southern state but Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign chairman, Bill Daley, played down the experience
factor, telling ABC's ``This Week'' Sunday that ``in today's world,
in today's new economy, the length of service or length of time on
a job isn't necessarily the only qualification'' for various posts.
</P>
<P>
   Daley also praised Kerry and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's strength is in his appeal to traditional Democrats, the
high-ranking campaign source said, along with his debating ability
and political skills. Kerry's Vietnam experience, originally
thought to be an asset, was played down by the official as a factor
in the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, meanwhile, is still in the running because of his
ability to attract moderate and centrist voters, historically, the
constituency that decides close elections. The campaign official
said that some Southerners have told the Gore campaign that they
would be completely comfortable with Lieberman on the ticket, even
though he is an Orthodox Jew from the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But the matter of Lieberman's religion could be an issue,
Democratic Party chairman Ed Rendell suggested Saturday night. ``If
Joe Lieberman were Episcopalian, he would be a slam-dunk,'' Rendell
told reporters after a Long Island fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, speaking on ``This Week,'' insisted that ``religion has
no impact whatsoever on his ability not only to be a great vice
presidential nominee, but to serve in the office with great
distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made racial and ethnic diversity a theme Sunday morning, as
he addressed parishioners at the Christ Episcopal Church in Sag
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This congregation looks like America,'' Gore said. ``A lot of
congregations are not. And a lot of institutions in our country are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were made just days after the Republican National
Convention, where nominee George W. Bush made an appeal to minority
voters, saying the Republicans would help African-Americans and
Latinos in the schoolrooms and the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who slammed the Republicans Friday for their ``masquerade
ball'' of a convention, did not mention Bush or the Republican
Party Sunday. Instead, Gore reflected on Sunday's 35th anniversary
of the passage of the Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that African-Americans were once forced to undergo trick
literacy tests to be allowed to vote, including one with the
question _ ``How many bubbles are there in a bar of soap? _ Gore
lamented the racism he said still infects the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of banal artifice of evil that has frequently
been used to disguise blatant and naked hatred,'' Gore told
worshippers at this small, historic church. ``The Voting Rights Act
delivered a knockout punch to Jim Crow'' laws, which discriminated
against blacks, and ``the effects are still being felt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sag Harbor fund-raiser later in the day, Gore kept to the
civil rights theme. He did not publicly utter his current campaign
refrain _ ``we're for the people; they're for the powerful'' _
before the group of wealthy business leaders.

VERIZON WALKOUT DISRUPTS SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Thousands of striking telephone customer service
representatives and technicians walked picket lines outside Verizon
Communications centers along the East Coast Sunday, demanding an
agreement that would permit the unionization of wireless workers
without interference from management.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout resulted in telephone service delays and a temporary
loss of directory assistance for customers as both sides continued
to discuss job security and other key issues.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon's two unions _ the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers and the Communications Workers of America _ said
a majority of the company's 85,000-member work force will not
report to work Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout at Verizon, the company formed by the merger of Bell
Atlantic and GTE, could affect 25 million customers in 12 Eastern
states, from Maine to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The company confirmed that service in Washington and parts of
New York was disrupted by rainy weather, and that managers at a
Philadelphia center had difficulty reporting to work when pickets
blocked their building entrances.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Rabe, a vice president for communications at Verizon, said
the company's 30,000 managers had been dispatched and would be
working 12-hour days, seven days a week to prevent lengthy
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Pickets began gathering early Sunday morning, several hours
after the unions formally announced a strike at midnight Sunday.
Several hundred strikers were posted at various sites around
Massachusetts, including Andover, Brighton, and downtown Boston.
Many said they were primarily concerned about layoffs and the
impact of new technology on their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the key words are respect from the company and job
security,'' said Thomas J. Flynn, 49, of Cambridge. The cable
maintenance technician and chief steward at the International
Brotherhood of Technical Workers Local 2222 was among dozens of
pickets who marched outside a company maintenance garage in
Brighton Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the major concern is the company's ability to move the
work at will,'' said Steve G. Smith, a 48-year-old cable splice
service technician and picket captain who monitored pickets in
Burlington and several other sites Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that even if the work is being done here in
Massachusetts, the company could move it someplace else,'' he said.
``They might offer me work in another state, but that wouldn't work
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks between the company and the CWA, which represents 72,000
customer service workers in the East, and the IBEW, the
representative for some 13,000 technicians and maintenance
employees, began June 26.
</P>
<P>
   However, the two sides deadlocked over the unions' demands for
contract language that would guarantee job security in the
fast-paced telecommunications industry. Union sources said the
company initially refused to discuss the unions' proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rabe confirmed that discussions are continuing and said the
company is hoping for a resolution soon, but declined to discuss
details of the talks or the company's contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   In what the unions are calling the most positive development
since talks began, the telecommunications giant is now talking to
union negotiators about organizing rights at Verizon Wireless this
weekend, a union representative said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of progress made late Saturday night on
developing a process that would protect the rights of nonunion
workers at Verizon Wireless who want to join a union,'' said Steve
Early, a CWA international union representative in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an exchange of proposals about the details of a
card check agreement. We do not have an agreement or even a
tentative agreement,'' Early said. ``But Verizon now recognizes
that to settle this strike it must address this issue. We are
intent on building up our base on the wireless side.''
</P>
<P>
   A key sticking point is a proposed neutrality or voluntary card
check agreement that would permit the unions to organize Verizon
Wireless, the company's cellular subsidiary, through the
distribution of union cards.
</P>
<P>
   Under such an agreement, wireless workers would become part of
an IBEW or CWA bargaining unit after more than 50 percent sign
union cards.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, unions are turning to such agreements in an effort
to avoid lengthy labor-management court battles over union election
results.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, just 42 of the wireless unit's 3,500 workers are
unionized. CWA organizers contend technical and service workers at
the company's wireless unit receive fewer benefits, work longer
hours and, in some cases, receive less pay than their union
counterparts in other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are also seeking protection from layoffs, provisions
that would allow workers in traditional wireline jobs to move into
the wireless division, and a cap on the percentage of workers who
may be transferred from the Eastern division to other units within
the company's newly expanded service area.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bell Atlantic Corp.'s merger with GTE this summer, its
service area has grown from the District of Columbia and 12 states
in the Eastern region to include an additional 18 states.

REMEMBERING SCHOOL DAYS IN IRAN, BEFORE THE REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 50 years after their high school
graduation, a group of men huddled around a television set showing
old Technicolor footage of the streets where they grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jubes!'' cried Joseph Elder, as the camera lingered on an
open ditch carrying water through the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, wow, kharbozeh!'' said Raymond Fort, spotting oblong
Persian melons stacked against a mud wall. ``Can't get them better
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the Alborz Mountains in the background,'' another
man said. ``They were 13,000 feet high.''
</P>
<P>
   The reunion was in New York, but the city in the film was
Tehran. In an often emotional reunion held over the weekend at the
Roosevelt Hotel, more than 500 alumni and teachers remembered two
American-run international schools as idyllic cultural crossroads
where children from any race, religion or ethnicity felt at home.
</P>
<P>
   The Tehran Community School, started by American Presbyterian
missionaries in 1935, weathered a world war, a coup and a
revolution before it and its counterpart, Iranzamin, closed in
1980, a year after Iran's Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni from North America, Europe, Australia and the Middle East
who attended the schools between 1935 and 1980 praised the schools'
academic standards, saying that when they moved elsewhere, they
were often years ahead of their peers. But the highest praise was
reserved for the schools' multinationalism, with the children of
ambassadors, businessmen, teachers and exiles representing more
than 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Like similar international schools around the world, the
Community School reflected global political tides. As war and then
communism spread across Europe and the Far East, and anti-Semitism
surfaced in nearby Arab countries, refugees spilled into Iran. With
its Western-looking shah and growing international community, it
was considered a haven, and the English-language school was a
magnet for new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were professors from the Sorbonne teaching us French and
Latin,'' said Kamel Bahary, a 1949 graduate. He also recalled
swimming at the home of the future Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who
attended the school while his father was helping to train the
Iranian police force.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Community's headmaster, a missionary named Richard
Irvine, limited the number of Americans to preserve the school's
cultural balance. A separate American school opened and other
international schools followed. Iranzamin, which means the ground
of Iran, was founded by Irvine in 1967 to prepare students for a
university education in any country, not just the United States and
Britain, as Community School did.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government had once barred Iranians from attending
foreign-run schools, but by the 1960s many families of the upper
middle class were enrolling their sons and daughters in hopes that
a Western education would afford greater opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Each era had its own political and social flavor. In the 1940s,
American soldiers taught students to square-dance. In the 1950s, as
Americans and Soviets competed for influence and the shah of Iran
was overthrown and then reinstated, students peered over garden
gates at the street fighting. Yearbooks from the 1970s show
long-haired teenagers in flare-legged jeans skiing, playing guitar,
and wandering through the ruins of Persepolis, the ancient Persian
capital. But by the end of that decade, those students were
crouching in their school buses to avoid stray bullets as
revolutionaries burned down banks and cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the bicultural experience had grown complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Rabbie, a 1975 Community School graduate, described
himself and his Iranian-born classmates as a ``lost generation of
imperialism,'' who liked pizza and were more fluent in English than
Farsi. But after the revolution that deposed the shah in 1979,
Rabbie said, he was kicked out of the Iranian Army for being
``foreign-educated,'' and Iranian children he had known all his
life turned against him. ``They told me: `It's time to go, Ronnie,
it's time to go. It's not your country any more,''' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, amid mounting restrictions on curriculum and student
activities, the two schools closed. Revolutionaries made a bonfire
out of Iranzamin's library.
</P>
<P>
   As foreigners and many middle-class Iranians left the country,
the Iranian students who stayed on were eventually sent to
Farsi-language schools. ``We were all good students,'' said Niloo
Momtazi. ``But we felt like total idiots trying to decipher the
textbooks.'' Today, Iran has a few foreign schools, but Iranians
must attend Iranian schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, after dining on pomegranate and walnut stew,
kebab, and rose-water ice cream, alumni danced to pre-revolutionary
Iranian and American favorites and pored over old yearbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kooros, a Community alumnus who is half Iranian and half
American, was in ninth grade when his family left for the United
States in 1979. ``Everyone was expecting to come back and pick up
where they left off,'' he said. ``So none of us traded addresses,
not that we had any to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But on this night, as Kooros exchanged stories with excited
long-lost classmates, he was beaming. ``It's a cathartic
experience,'' he said, ``to come back and complete these
childhoods.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness, the elegant and versatile British actor known
to older audiences for films like ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
and to a whole new generation for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars,'' died late Saturday at a hospital in West Sussex,
England. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing a plain-as-porridge but chameleonlike face, Guinness
was one of those gifted actors who left audiences awed with his
seemingly effortless, perfect performances, which he carried off
with quiet subtlety and undemonstrative skill.
</P>
<P>
   Although his notable career encompassed the stage and
television, it was in motion pictures that a much wider audience
found Guinness unforgettable almost from the moment he first
appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   He was a most versatile performer, capable of playing a wide
range of roles, beginning in 1946, when he was Herbert Pocket in
the movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations.'' He
delighted millions with his wittily etched, tour-de-force
delineations of 10 members of an eccentric English family
(including a spinster and a character in an oil painting) in ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' in 1949. And he developed a cult following
for his merry antics in ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' and ``The
Captain's Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most memorable dramatic roles was the driven
regimental colonel in postwar Scotland in ``Tunes of Glory.'' And
another military role, as the slightly mad military prig of a
colonel in ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, won him an
Academy Award. He was knighted in the late 1950s by Queen
Elizabeth, but still had a long career ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was often said that as a master of disguise he was
an actor with no face of his own, it was, in fact, the intelligent
use of his malleable features that served him so extraordinarily
well. In situations where lesser performers required several lines
of dialogue to accomplish an effect, Guinness used his own facial
shorthand _ the faint curling of a lip, a seemingly apologetic
furrowing of the brow, the quizzical upturn of an eyebrow, the
slight but visible widening of the eyes in disbelief, a sudden
brief smile that could radiate approval or signify chilly disdain.
Particularly in motion-picture close-up, he did not so much act as
allow his face to react to what another actor was saying.
</P>
<P>
   He was the antithesis of the personality player or star, for he
accepted small and large roles that ranged from the starkly
dramatic to the predictably melodramatic to the maniacally
whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done has been on the spur of the moment,'' the
actor said some years ago. ``That's why my career has been so
haphazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Haphazard or not, it was a notable career, one in which Guinness
triumphed in the theater in roles as startlingly dissimilar as
Hamlet and the suave psychiatrist in T.S. Eliot's ``Cocktail
Party.'' He was the drink-sodden and doomed Welsh poet Dylan Thomas
in Sidney Michaels' biographical drama ``Dylan'' and the tragically
broken and brainwashed prelate in ``The Cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played a Japanese businessman in ``A Majority of One''
in 1962, the same year that he was seen as the Arab prince, Feisal,
in ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and Hitler in ``Hitler: The Last 10
Days.'' He had business savvy as well _ for his memorable role in
the 1977 blockbuster ``Star Wars,'' he received a percentage of the
gross.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was born in London on April 2, 1914.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``Blessings in Disguise,'' published in
the United States in 1986, Guinness cleared up longtime speculation
as to whether he was an illegitimate child. He was indeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pembroke Lodge, a boarding school, the headmaster discouraged
the youth from student theatricals by telling him, ``You're not the
acting type,'' but later, at Roborough School in Eastbourne, he won
the role of the breathless messenger in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   His schooling finished in 1932, he went to work as an apprentice
copywriter in a London advertising agency. ``The very first thing I
did was on impulse to phone Martita Hunt and ask her to give me
acting lessons,'' he recalled years later. ``After a few lessons
she sent me packing.'' In fact, after 12 lessons, Hunt, a renowned
actress who later played Habersham with him in ``Great
Expectations,'' told the drab and emaciated young man in 1933,
``You'll never make an actor, Mr. Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the would-be actor applied to the Fay Compton
Studio of Dramatic Art, which gave him a modest scholarship, and he
was able to study and live on a single baked-beans-on-toast meal a
day. Guinness left the Compton Studio after seven months, but not
before an annual recital at which the judges, John Gielgud among
them, awarded him a major prize. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, literally a starving young actor, Guinness got work in
a lurid shipboard melodrama called ``Queer Cargo,'' in which he
played three small roles. Then Gielgud gave him his first big
break, casting him as Osric and the Third Player in the Gielgud
production of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My theater tide began to come in because of Sir John's
generosity, for from that point on I was never truly out of a job
unless I wanted it that way,'' Guinness recalled in 1982. He was
from the start a sort of critics' darling _ one called his Osric in
``Hamlet'' an ``admirable popinjay,'' and later his Sir Andrew
Aguecheek in ``Twelfth Night'' was pronounced ``a collector's
item.''
</P>
<P>
   Before enlisting in the Royal Navy in 1941, the actor had
learned many lessons well, having played 34 parts in 23 plays by
Shakespeare, Pinero, Chekhov, Shaw and Sheridan. ``It was
obvious,'' Tyrone Guthrie said about that period, ``that he was
going to be tremendously talented. It was not so obvious that he
was going to be so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   On being mustered out, he resumed his writing and stage career
in the role of Mitya in his own version of Dostoyevski's ``Brothers
Karamazov,'' an artistic success that failed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   His other stage appearances in the postwar period included roles
in Sartre's ``Vicious Circle,'' the Dauphin in Shaw's ``Saint
Joan'' and the title role in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' Of the
last, the critic for The Sunday Express of London wrote: ``Mr.
Guinness is slight, with an interesting angular face and a clear,
flexible voice. He has dignity, but no majesty; he has range and
control, but no surprises. He is intensely good without being great
_ yet. His future may bring that.'' In 1946, the director David
Lean cast him as Pocket in the now-classic film version of ``Great
Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Lean allowed him to play an extremely wicked Fagin in a
controversial version of ``Oliver Twist,'' whose release in the
United States was held up for more than two years because of
pressure brought by groups that considered the Guinness
characterization anti-Semitic. The U.S. version was also censored,
but among moviegoers worldwide, Guinness had clinched his claim to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   A choice comedy role came in 1953 in ``The Captain's Paradise,''
when he played a Mediterranean ferryboat skipper who commutes
between wives as well as ports. Along came ``The Ladykillers'' in
1955, closely followed by his first Hollywood film, a glossily cold
remake of Molnar's ``The Swan'' in which he starred with Grace
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In his greatest film triumph, ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,''
Guinness was called upon to be ``both admirable and tiresome,'' he
said, as the fascinatingly paradoxical Colonel Nicholson, a British
officer interned in a hellish Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in
Burma. He made Nicholson at times infuriating, at times pitiable, a
man whose strict adherence to an old-fashioned code of military
ethics was both his scourge and his moral salvation.
</P>
<P>
   As Gulley Jimson in ``The Horse's Mouth,'' he was an unkempt old
rogue of a painter who was so obsessed by his art that he had no
regard for the feelings or needs of anyone who dared impinge on his
creativity. Guinness received an Academy Award nomination, not for
his acting, which was splendid, but for the screenplay he wrote
from the novel by Joyce Cary.
</P>
<P>
   Other film roles included ``The Comedians,'' ``The Quiller
Memorandum,'' ``A Christmas Carol'' and Franco Zeffirelli's
``Brother Sun, Sister Moon,'' none of which reversed the descending
trend of the actor's film fortunes in the early 1970s. In 1976,
however, he easily stole all his scenes in Neil Simon's ``Murder by
Death,'' a mystery spoof in which he played a blind butler Although
films occupied most of his time, Guinness did not entirely desert
the stage. His greatest success on Broadway came in 1964, when
Peter Glenville prodded him into taking the tricky and difficult
title role in ``Dylan,'' an anecdotal drama dealing with the
self-destructive poet Dylan Thomas' last liquor-sodden months.
Guinness was the antithesis in character of the Welsh poet, but he
gave a performance so heartwrenchingly sad that he won almost every
available acting prize that season. The critic Walter Kerr termed
the performance ``mesmerizing,'' adding, ``There is a still center
in the actor, a coal in the ashes that defies us to will our eyes
away.'' (Years later, commenting on a trifling play superbly acted
by Guinness in London, Kerr, not content with the title Queen
Elizabeth II had conferred on the actor, dubbed him ``St. Alec.'')
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' appearances on television were rare but memorable. His
most notable achievement was the character of George Smiley, the
retired British intelligence officer he created in two multipart
series seen in Britain and the United States in the early 1980s _
``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ``Smiley's People,'' written
by John le Carre. His understated characterization of the aging,
spiritually burnt-out and forlorn former spy underscored his
reputation as ``an actor who makes you forget that he is acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, who had been almost bald since his late 20s, was often
described as ``dignified'' and ``shy'' and ``quiet, unassuming.''
He lived modestly in an unpretentious house in Hampshire, in the
south of England, with his wife, Merula Salaman, a former actress.
They were married in 1938 when both were appearing as animals in
John Gielgud's production of ``Noah.'' They had a son, Matthew.

   ``Returning'' starter at quarterback on the ``Star-Telegram's''
17th-ranked college football team.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, go over Casey Printers' essentials again. It doesn't seem
possible that a 19-year-old, without the benefit of a redshirt
season, could be ready for so much so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But Casey Printers, one of the best freshmen in the nation last
season, isn't the average sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey is a sophomore in eligibility only. He's much wiser
emotionally and mentally,'' TCU coach Dennis Franchione said.
``He's firmly entrenched in the program as a leader at a very young
age, and players look up to him. They respect his commitment to the
game, his commitment to the team and commitment to being good. And
he works hard at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this would be hard for a normal sophomore, but he's not
normal. In 28 years, he's the best freshman I've ever coached at
quarterback. I think he relishes the part of being a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Printers is ready for the role. As a freshman in 1999, the
former DeSoto standout played in 11 games for the Horned Frogs.
Taking over for an injured Patrick Batteaux in the third quarter of
the second game, Printers went on to start the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Printers passed for 1,213 yards and eight touchdowns over the
regular season. He added another 173 yards and a touchdown in the
Mobile Alabama Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated'' tabbed him one of the ``Top-10 True
Freshmen in the Country,'' and ``The Sporting News'' selected him
third-team All-American at quarterback. Michael Vick of Virginia
Tech and Wisconsin's Brook Bollinger, first- and second-team,
respectively, were both redshirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really high on Casey Printers,'' said tailback LaDainian
Tomlinson, TCU's Heisman Trophy hopeful. ``He showed a lot of
leadership coming in as a true freshman last year and starting 10
games for us. With more experience, he's only going to get better,
and by the time he's a senior, he's going to be one of the top
quarterbacks in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Printers had an 8-2 record as the starter, though for much of
the regular season he split time with Batteaux. Against East
Carolina in the Mobile Bowl, however, Printers nearly went it
alone. Showing poise and maturity beyond his years, Printers took
home MVP honors after leading TCU to a 28-14 upset of the
20th-ranked Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence is carrying over to his second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm on the level of a senior, because I understand
the offense totally,'' said Printers, who's switching to jersey No.
1 this season after wearing No. 11 in '99. ``I know what we're
trying to accomplish, and all we have to do is execute.''
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty on the Frogs' wish list for 2000, starting with
an outright Western Athletic Conference championship in their final
season in the league. Printers' plans for the season, starting Aug.
15 with two-a-day practices, are a little loftier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go in and work my butt off, help LT win the
Heisman and hopefully we'll go 11-0,'' he said. \Nsubheds:The new
Casey \Nbody:Though Printers completed 57.3 percent of his passes
last season, coaches began tweaking his technique as soon as spring
drills began in March.
</P>
<P>
   They noticed Printers' habit of lining up his left foot, the
lead foot, in the wrong direction when he's throwing to the left
side of the field. Franchione said his form is perfect when
throwing right, but because Printers is a good off-balance passer,
he was able to overcome the flaw when going to his left.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione and new offensive coordinator Les Koenning Jr. ironed
out the kink with Printers over the 15 spring sessions. Printers
noticed the difference as soon as he compared film from the Mobile
Bowl to tape from the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I look like a totally different player,'' he said.
``I look stronger, more athletic and versatile.
</P>
<P>
   ``My coaches were always on me. Coach Koenning did a good job of
staying on top of me and showing me what to do. I'm no longer
throwing off my back foot. I also feel more comfortable running the
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Batteaux excelled in the option, a staple of Franchione's
multiple-attack offense. Printers has the size (6-foot-3 and 205
pounds), strength (bench presses nearly 400 pounds) and the speed
(4.6 in the 40-yard dash) to be dangerous running the option, but
Franchione said Printers has been too tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to just let it fly and not be so much of a
start-and-restart guy,'' Franchione said. ``Pat could do a little
bit more of that. Casey is best when he just keeps going and runs.
In the bowl game he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Franchione doesn't want to change is Printers' feel
for the game. Franchione compares Printers favorably with Stoney
Case, his star quarterback at New Mexico and now a backup with the
Detroit Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stoney was such a fierce competitor,'' said Franchione, who
left New Mexico for TCU after the 1997 season. ``During his junior
and senior years, we would make changes during the game that you
might have to work a week on in practice. Casey is already like
that. He's such a student of the game that he'll bring you ideas
and thoughts, and a lot of times they're really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Printers has clued in the coaching staff on potential recruits
and offered ideas on how to better utilize current personnel.
Against Hawaii last season, Printers made a check with receiver
Mike Scarborough after noticing how the Warriors overplayed a hitch
earlier in the game. It turned into a 48-yard touchdown pass that
broke open the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what they were going to do,'' Franchione
said. ``When he launched it I said, `Oh, what in the hell is going
on here?' And then it's, `Good throw, good throw.' That's the kind
of player he is.'' \Nsubheds:Dreams for 2000 \Nbody:Printers
understands the unique opportunities awaiting the Frogs this
season. Ranked in The Associated Press preseason Top 25 for the
first time since 1960 at No. 20, TCU is not only the overwhelming
WAC favorite, but the Frogs are looking at a possible berth in the
Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, TCU must finish the season ranked among the
top six. The Frogs' schedule is favorable; they play WAC contenders
Fresno State and Hawaii at Amon Carter Stadium. However, the
schedule's overall lack of strength could make a major jump in the
polls difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think we have a chance \Rat the BCS\S,'' Printers
said. ``If we just take it one game at a time, I think we'll be
just fine ... 11-0, 10-1, that's the goal for this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RBeing ranked is\S a great honor for us. It's good for our
recruiting and things like that, but we want more respect. We're a
team that's hungry. We still have a point to prove, and we're going
to go out and prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of Hawaii and Fresno State, Printers figures the Frogs
will get stern tests from Rice and SMU in the WAC, and Northwestern
in nonconference play. Printers also remembered his struggles
against Arkansas State, a 24-21 victory in his first start, and
said Tulsa could be a sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get started. We're very excited,'' Printers
said. ``Everybody is just prancing around waiting for the season to
start, but we're a very focused football team. Coach Fran keeps the
pedal pressed down on us pretty good. We have our eyes set on the
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione can't see anyone other than the 19-year-old sophomore
leading the charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade him for anyone right now,'' Franchione said.
``If we were drawing 'em up, we'd draw 'em about like Casey
Printers.'' .MDBU/ nn

W.R. COLE, 80, WHO BROUGHT POETRY TO CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Rossa Cole, an anthologist, editor and writer of
children's books and light verse, died on Wednesday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Cole was the author, co-author, editor or co-editor of more than
75 books, including more than 50 anthologies for children and
adults. Among them was ``I Went to the Animal Fair: A Book of
Animal Poems'' (1958), an anthology for children that he edited.
Elizabeth Minot Graves, writing in The New York Times Book Review,
praised it as ``the sort of book that children big and small,
parents and grandparents would enjoy reading and reciting 'round a
winter fire.''
</P>
<P>
   That book was on the American Library Association List of
Notable Children's Books of 1940-59 and was also named a notable
book of 1958 by the association.
</P>
<P>
   Cole was also the editor of the anthologies ``Beastly Boys and
Ghastly Girls: Poems'' and ``The Birds and Beasts Were There:
Animal Poems,'' American Library Association notable books for 1964
and 1965, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Staten Island to William Harrison Cole and the former
Margaret O'Donovan-Rossa, Cole graduated from high school there. He
served in the infantry in Europe in World War II, rising to
sergeant and receiving the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he was publicity director at Alfred A. Knopf,
publicity director and editor at Simon &AMP; Schuster and a publisher,
with Viking Press, of William Cole Books.
</P>
<P>
   He also was a columnist for The Saturday Review, a vice
president of PEN American Center and a member of the governing
board of the Poetry Society of America and the executive board of
Poets and Writers.
</P>
<P>
   His 1947 marriage to Peggy Bennett and his 1967 marriage to
Galen Williams ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two sons, Williams and Rossa, both of
Manhattan; two daughters, Jeremy Rossa Cole of Portland, Maine, and
Cambria Cole-Pirro of Hampton Bays, N.Y.; a grandson; and a
brother, Rossa, of East Rutherford, N.J.

EDITORIAL: AMERICA IN THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   These are heady yet baffling times for the world's sole
superpower. Less than a decade after the demise of the Soviet
Union, the United States is a military and economic colossus. No
nation in history has possessed the wealth, military might or
technological edge over its rivals that America has today. Yet as
the presidential campaign enters its final months, the country
seems uncertain about its role and perplexed by the changing array
of threats that it faces. There should be vigorous debate about
these matters in the days ahead, starting with an assessment of
America's critical national interests.
</P>
<P>
   There are clear and important differences between Gov. George W.
Bush and and Vice President Al Gore on Russia, China, missile
defenses and other pressing issues. We intend to return to some of
these matters as the campaign unfolds. But specific policies cannot
be developed or evaluated in isolation. They should flow from
principles that reflect the nation's core values and interests.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder today than during the Cold War to define U.S.
interests and to determine how best to defend them. Contamination
of the world's air and water or a currency crisis in Asia can
threaten U.S. security as much as a fleet of Russian bombers. The
free flow of information across national borders may be a more
potent force for advancing democracy than dispatch of U.S. aircraft
carriers to a distant sea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some core national interests remain unchanged. The
physical defense of America's territory, people and economic
lifelines is paramount. The Pentagon can safely eliminate thousands
of nuclear weapons left over from the Cold War, but must maintain
enough to discourage attack. America also needs highly trained and
mobile military forces, adequately paid and equipped with advanced
weaponry. Washington must also guard against international
terrorist groups. Effective intelligence gathering is an essential
first line of defense. Washington should provide adequate financing
for these purposes, but spending must be based on realistic needs,
not inflated threat assessments or parochial congressional
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a powerful enemy like the Soviet Union, the
country has found itself with few established guidelines to decide
when military intervention abroad is warranted. Clearly,
self-defense and the protection of allies and economic lifelines
are reasons to use force, as Washington did when oil supplies were
endangered by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   But as recent upheavals in Africa and the Balkans have shown,
ethnic conflicts can escalate to imperil the stability of an entire
region, and genocidal attacks on civilians sometimes can be stopped
only by outside force. Washington should consider intervening in
such conflicts if it is clear that force can make a difference and
sufficient military resources are available to assure success, the
case in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the last decades of the 20th century showed, the defense of
U.S. security is no longer primarily defined by sending military
forces into combat. The United States is uniquely suited to
encourage peacemaking in troubled regions like the Middle East.
President Clinton has used U.S. influence constructively in the
Middle East and Northern Ireland, and his successor should continue
the work he has begun. It may also be appropriate, as in Bosnia, to
send U.S. troops overseas to serve as peacekeepers once warring
parties have laid down their arms and agreed to a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the country's security and prosperity are connected to
the global movement of goods, capital, information and people.
Keeping these channels of commerce and technology open can be as
important as defending a foreign border. Washington should advance
these interests through trade agreements that lower barriers to
imports and investment. But the preservation of a stable global
economic order, a vital U.S. interest, cannot be accomplished
without spreading prosperity's benefits more fairly. Three billion
people, or half the world's population, live on less than $2 a day.
Bettering their lives requires more effective governance, increased
private investment and expanded access to education and health
care.
</P>
<P>
   America also makes its own democracy more secure by promoting
democracy elsewhere. The evolution of Russia and China into
enduring democratic states would make the world a far safer place
and erase two of the greatest potential threats to U.S. security.
Encouraging democracy and the rule of law in these nations should
be among the primary goals of the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting health and the environment are central U.S.
interests. Epidemics and climate change know no borders. Strong
environmental treaties and efforts to make medicines more widely
available must be a high priority for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Once Bush and Gore engage foreign policy, they should spell out
their thoughts about these broad national interests. Bush has so
far taken the more creative approach to the question of nuclear
weapons reductions. Gore has been more forward looking on
environmental issues and has shown a more nuanced appreciation of
the role U.S. troops could play in halting regional conflicts. But
the debate between them has not moved much beyond rhetorical
flourishes. Voters deserve a serious discussion of how this
country's power should be used to advance the global interests of
its people.

MARINERS MISS BOAT AT TRADING DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A poll commissioned by The Sporting News and published
last month asked baseball general managers, assistant GMs and
personnel directors to name the top 30 current players, regardless
of position or team.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez was No. 2, behind Boston ace
Pedro Martinez. No. 3 was ex-Mariners pitcher Randy Johnson. No.6
was ex-Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   In the story, Sporting News asked: How did the Mariners fail to
win a championship with three of the top six players?
</P>
<P>
   Any Mariners fan over the last five years can provide the
answer: This isn't pro basketball, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Three superstars in the NBA is one more than necessary to win,
say, six championships in eight years. But baseball is so
pitching-dependent and the Mariners were so pitching-light after
the Big Unit that they have managed a just a single playoff-game
win over the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The reason they were pitching-light was because ownership was so
preoccupied with cutting losses and building a new ballpark that
investment in player payroll took a distant backseat.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after the Great Squandering and the departure of two
the game's best players, the Mariners have sufficient pitching.
They also have profits, thanks to the taxpayer-financed Safeco
Field and its high-spending hordes who will likely set a
single-season club attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the Mariners lead baseball's tiniest division,
which is absent any ownerships who are reckless with a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   So the 2000 season represents a splendid chance to answer The
Sporting News and pay back the millions of Northwesterners and
their millions of dollars with a World Series appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the results from the initial trading deadline a
week ago were for discerning Mariners fans a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   With a three-game lead instead of six games in arrears, the
Mariners were not in a panic. And it's true that the club's big
moves, nearly all of which have worked, were done in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   But Al Martin? He's not a bad pickup, but a guy who's been on
three teams in five months and with two wives simultaneously is not
exactly the emotional bedrock upon which to fan a pennant drive.
</P>
<P>
   He's a left fielder, and a mediocre one at that, coming to a
position already filled by recent newcomer Rickey Henderson. That
has meant Martin in his first week has played more center field and
right field than he has in his eight-year major league career
combined, in order to avoid sending Henderson into one of his
legendary pouts over playing time.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that leads the major leagues in runners left on base,
he represents the teensiest of solutions. He's a left-handed bat
who can run a little and will help the lame pinch-hitting, but he
rarely hits breaking pitches and probably couldn't gun down at
second base a shopping cart with a bad wheel.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mariners have invested $8 million in left field ($5
million for Martin, $3 million for Henderson) when they already
have a capable backup outfielder in Stan Javier, who has more RBI
than Martin in 100 fewer at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In utilityman John Mabry and minor league pitcher Tom Davey, the
Mariners didn't give up much. But they didn't get much, which
contrasts heavily with what happened with the contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mariners are assured of no less than a split of
the big four-game series against the Yankees _ thanks to Sunday's
11-1 clobbering _ that ends today, the Yankees repaired themselves
over the past month with the additions of David Justice and
Glenallen Hill and pitchers Denny Neagle and Dwight Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox pulled off a seven-player trade that added pitcher
Rolando Arrojo and second baseman Mike Lansing. Boston's staff
leads the American League in ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays traded for three veteran pitchers, and Oakland
added set-up reliever Jim Mecir, whose virtue as an ex-Mariner is
that he is almost guaranteed to do what ex-Mariners always do
against Seattle _ star.
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by their 23 runs over the weekend at Yankee
Stadium, the Mariners are a solid team. But it also demonstrates
that the Yankees are as vulnerable as they have been in their
half-decade of dominance. With less than two months of the season
remaining, there isn't a formidable team in the AL, and only seven
real contenders for the four postseason spots.
</P>
<P>
   It's a season of rare opportunity, and the Mariners are on the
verge. But with a 13-11 mark after the All-Star break, a little
personnel lightning last week could have been decisive. Instead, it
appears they are in a summer-long swordfight with Oakland, whose
$32 million payroll _ about $30 million less than Seattle _ is a
giant egg aimed right at the faces of Mariners ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In defending his reluctance to part with prime minor league
pitching talent for immediate batting help, Mariners GM Pat Gillick
sounded wise when he said his plan is to create enough personnel
depth to win at least 90 games every year for 10 years and take his
chances in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Gillick is coming up against a lot of bad
Mariners history (they have won as many as 90 games in a season
just once, in 1997) and a tempting present _ an AL more winnable
than any time in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   While the Mariners can be happy to have survived the trades of
Johnson and Griffey, they need the franchise's best season to keep
Rodriguez and the fickle part of the fan base, which in
major-league sports is increasingly large and vulnerable. Ask the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   There is always logic and comfort in prudence. But the Mariners
in their new ballpark are rich and successful enough to be done
with the phony small-market conservatism and engage in a little
swashbuckling.

EDITORIAL: BLACKLISTING THE DALAI LAMA
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Geopolitics has tainted the Millennium World Peace Summit of
Religious and Spiritual Leaders planned for New York City later
this month. The meeting, paid for mainly by private foundations,
will be held at the United Nations a week before a similar
gathering of world political leaders. It will bring together more
than 1,000 religious figures. But under pressure from China,
organizers have not invited the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of
Tibetan Buddhism and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, to
attend any of the meetings on the grounds of the United Nations.
Other attendees and the conference's financial backers should
oppose his exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   China detests the Dalai Lama because he is a symbol of the
distinctive Tibetan culture Beijing has been trying to destroy for
the past 41 years. China regularly uses its power as a member of
the Security Council to block his participation in U.N.-sponsored
events. The Dalai Lama has told the conference organizers that they
should go ahead without him. But it would be better to take a stand
against his unjustifiable exclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Some have already done so. Desmond Tutu, the retired archbishop
of Cape Town and himself a Nobel Peace laureate, has urged the U.N.
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, to invite the Dalai Lama to the
conference. So have Reps. Tom Lantos and John Edward Porter,
co-chairmen of the congressional Human Rights Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The conference's chief financial underwriter, Ted Turner, and
the religious leaders planning to attend should make clear that if
the United Nations is not prepared to reverse itself, they will
move the conference to another location. A gathering of spiritual
and religious leaders for world peace should not have a political
admissions test.

 &HT;    STATE'S FEMALE INMATE POPULATION IS SOARING(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the number of women behind bars in Arizona was
barely enough to fill one prison wing.
</P>
<P>
   But their ranks have swollen so much that female felons now
warrant their own prison, proof that crime is an equal-opportunity
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Female inmates are still scattered among five prisons throughout
the state. But by October, they all will move to the Arizona State
Prison at Perryville in Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   The move is necessary, according to officials with the Arizona
Department of Corrections, as a cost-cutting measure in the face of
a booming female prison population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite clearly, our female population is growing at a faster
rate,'' said Camilla Strongin, a DOC spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The number of female inmates has exploded since 1980, when just
171 women were serving time. The number has risen tenfold since
then, and is expected to top 2,000 by next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade alone, the number of female inmates has more
than doubled. The rate of increase even eclipsed the 84 percent
growth in male inmates, whose numbers over the past decade soared
to 24,494, from 13,272.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's growth in prisoners mirrors a national trend during
the 1990s, in which the overall prison population boomed, and the
rate of female incarceration rose even faster. Nationally, prison
ranks doubled in the past decade, according to a recent
congressional study.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office also found that the majority of
women were held for non-violent crimes. Tough new laws covering
drug offenses are largely credited for the explosion of prison
populations.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, as elsewhere, the growth continues.
</P>
<P>
   The DOC projects the number of female inmates will rise to 3,615
by 2008 based on the number of crimes being committed by women,
nearly double again the number in Arizona prisons today.
</P>
<P>
   The move to Perryville, which affects 1,867 women, involves a
series of complicated transfers of male inmates to other prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to juggle male bed space to make room for the
women,'' said Ellen Kirschbaum, DOC's female programs
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``During all this, not only do we have to move men out, we have
construction that has to go on,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   That construction involves adding beds for inmates with
disabilities to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities
Act. Workers also are repainting the facility, which is nearly 20
years old.
</P>
<P>
   The move seems to be sitting well with female prisoners, even
though some have been overwhelmed by the size of the Perryville
facility and its larger prison population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot more staff than we were used to dealing
with,'' said Paula Reynolds, 49, who has served 91/2 years of her
20-year sentence for killing her abusive boyfriend. She had been
housed in a different unit at the Perryville complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are a totally different breed - more emotional and maybe
more mouthy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The prison department expects to save money by housing female
inmates in one place, rather than having to transport them among
facilities as far away as Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also know more than 60 percent of our females come from
Maricopa County, although half have been housed in Tucson,''
Strongin said. ``So this move has an added benefit for their
families and for their release back into the community from where
they came.''
</P>
<P>
   Consolidating female prisoners in Arizona is part of a larger
trend of grouping prisoners by the crimes they committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a move to consolidate certain
populations,'' Strongin said. ``A couple of years ago, we started
consolidating all the sex offenders together because it eliminated
the risk to them of being housed with other types of prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   Although overwhelmed by the size of her new unit, inmate
Reynolds said it is better than her former accommodations - a tent
with swamp coolers, fans and nine roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an optimal kind of living,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow inmate Tracy James agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so thankful to get out of the tents,'' said James, who
has spent the past three years of her nine-year sentence at
Perryville prison. She was convicted of killing her fianci in a
domestic violence situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have put me in a massive place or a minute one. I
didn't care. All I know is that I have running water in my cell and
my own restroom. And they gave us our TVs back.''
</P>
<P>
   James, 32, is also glad the prison eventually will be occupied
only by women, because it means more jobs for female prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of jobs will be opening up,'' possibly at the Hickman
Farms and in telemarketing, she said. ``Pretty much the women are
going to run the prison.''

FLIGHTS OF THOUGHT ON COWBOYS' PROGRESS _ OR LACK OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's get one thing straight.
</P>
<P>
   There's no such thing as a good 12-hour flight.
</P>
<P>
   However, the excitement of going to a foreign country made the
front end of this round-trip to Tokyo somewhat palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The return was nothing but a beat down _ somewhat akin to the
ones the Cowboys routinely take in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   But back to yesterday's tedious flight home. The movie choices
were ``My Dog Skip'', an updated version of ``Lassie'', and the
sassy ``Erin Brockovich''. Huh?
</P>
<P>
   A manly action flick would have been nice, considering the
inaction from the Cowboys in the second half of Saturday's 20-9
loss to the Falcons. Four turnovers on six second-half possessions?
</P>
<P>
   What better time then to ponder what we've learned about the
Cowboys after two weeks of training camp and two preseason games?
</P>
<P>
   So here are some random thoughts from ``somewhere over the
Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you realize that if Randall Cunningham hadn't fallen in the
Cowboys' lap then Paul Justin, who looks the second coming of Hugh
Millen, would be the team's backup quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's two turnovers against the Falcons give him six in two
preseason games. It's downright hilarious that the Cowboys still
insist that they are comfortable with Justin.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only that Justin has made mistakes, it's that he's done
it by forcing the issue. Generally, you want your backup
quarterback to play within himself and be a caretaker, such as
Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that theory doesn't hold with Cunningham. But not
even the Cowboys are comparing Justin with Cunningham. The fact
that the Cowboys signed Cunningham speaks volumes _ about the
two-time MVP Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys should get credit for not only getting Cunningham,
but for how they are using him. Cunningham basically has three
playbooks, the conventional one that starter Troy Aikman uses, the
special plays that the Cowboys inserted for him and the free-lance
plays that he makes up.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the real reason the Cowboys signed him.
Ironically, for much of Cunningham's career, he has been criticized
for improvising too much, running too much and not running the
offense enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 37, the Cowboys want him to run _ and do whatever _
as much as he wants. His ad-libs have been impressive so far.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the Cowboys' inability to get in the end zone
against the Falcons. Remember the first-team offense played without
running back Emmitt Smith and guard Larry Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the NFL all-time leader in rushing touchdowns, and Allen,
the league's best offensive lineman, know a little something about
getting into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Also, don't worry about linebacker Dat Nguyen not being able to
handle the middle. Sure, the Cowboys are going to get creased at
times for big plays up the middle because of Nguyen's size.
However, he's a playmaker. And he's going help you a lot more than
he's going to hurt you.
</P>
<P>
   Other players who put smiles on the Cowboys faces when their
names come up are tight end Jackie Harris, guard Kelvin Garmon and
defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman.
</P>
<P>
   Do, however, worry about the cornerbacks. Not because the
Cowboys do not have Deion Sanders, but because of who they do have.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ryan McNeil is a proven veteran, but he is three
years removed from when he was considered among the league's top
cornerbacks. While he's the best on the Cowboys, can he get back to
the higher level?
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith is healthier than he's been in a couple
of years. But aren't his best days behind him?
</P>
<P>
   And rookie second-round pick Dwayne Goodrich is, so far, living
down to expectations in the vein of previous busts Shante Carver
and Kavika Pittman. His body language is worse than his play. How
can the Cowboys feel comfortable about playing him when he looks so
beaten down.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, confidence and swagger are not a problem for
the other two rookie corners. Both Kareem Larrimore (fourth round)
and Mario Edwards (sixth round) have been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they've been beaten on plays. But they always come back
raring for more. While Larrimore is part of the first nickel group,
look for the chatty Edwards to get the first shot at starting if
Smith falters.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, if Erik Williams is not back by the start of the
season, look for him in Week 7.
</P>
<P>
   Whew, just 10 more hours to go.
</P>
<P>
   Brokovich or sleep?
</P>
<P>
   Both. nn

QUARTERBACK DEPTH STILL QUESTIONABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Ray Buck 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that the Cowboys have been outscored by a 3-1 margin in
preseason losses to Pittsburgh and Atlanta is pertinent only if you
believe that the third-team quarterback is going to play a role in
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Or that the No. 3 quarterback is going to play this season,
period.
</P>
<P>
   If it gets down to either the much-maligned Paul Justin (six
turnovers in two games) or rookie Clint Stoerner needing to deliver
when the games begin to count Sept. 3, then the season isn't going
to be worth much anyway. That's just how the NFL works.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, 0-2, have more reason to fret with five turnovers
and 10 penalties which occurred in their 20-9 loss to the Falcons
at the Big Egg in Tokyo, because that reflects a lack of both
discipline and focus that Dave Campo preaches every day in training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are back in Wichita Falls tomorrow after returning
yesterday from Japan and completing their second 12-hour flight in
four days.
</P>
<P>
   What has come out of the quarterback play in the first two
exhibitions is that the Cowboys no longer see Troy Aikman's
thirtysomething backup as someone who is better-suited to coach the
quarterbacks than to be one himself.
</P>
<P>
   That's what really chased away longtime backup Jason Garrett,
who defected in February to the NFC East rival New York Giants,
where he is Kerry Collins' backup. That opened the door for Randall
Cunningham to come to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your second quarterback doesn't get the work that he needs in
the offense to stay with the game plan,'' Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
said of Cunningham. ``What Randall brings to the table is an
`impromptu ' approach. He doesn't need the \Rextensive\S
preparation during the week to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Steelers, Cunningham turned a potential coverage
sack into a 21-yard gain when he pulled the ball down and
scrambled. Against the Falcons, the 37-year-old veteran completed 3
of 5 passes for 45 yards, relying on Wane McGarity and Chris
Brazzell, not Joey Galloway and Rocket Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that \RCunningham\S, with a full week to get
ready for a game, can be able to run all of our offense,'' said
Jones, who can quote Cunningham's 8-4 career record against the
Cowboys. ``And Randall actually is more suited to the three-, five-
and seven-step drops in our offense than he has been in the West
Coast offense.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the job that the Cowboys wanted Garrett to take is now
filled by Wade Wilson, who retired after 19 NFL seasons. And
Garrett's job as Aikman's backup now belongs to Cunningham, who was
released by Minnesota for salary-cap purposes only two years after
he was the NFL's MVP.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cowboys so far, Cunningham is 2-for-2 in putting points
on the boards: two field-goal drives.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and Cunningham are responsible for all five of the
Cowboys' scoring drives. Aikman has completed 70 percent of his
passes for 158 yards and has engineered one touchdown and two field
goals in his four series.
</P>
<P>
   But the No. 3 quarterback candidates, Justin and Stoerner, have
combined for eight turnovers and no scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   Justin, a 58-percent NFL career passer with only 10
interceptions in 380 NFL pass attempts, already has had more
interceptions (six) than completions (four) for the Cowboys. Justin
also has lost two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Stoerner has completed nearly 58 percent of his passes for 126
yards, but he has had two interceptions. Each time, he forced the
ball to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   What matters most to the Cowboys is that Aikman and Cunningham
have game.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has slipped badly after being Aikman's backup before
Cunningham's arrival June 8. Now Justin probably gets the fewest
number of snaps in practice _ and it shows. Since Justin knows the
Cowboys' basic system from his past connections to Mike Martz
(Arizona State and St. Louis Rams), he usually gets fewer practice
reps than Stoerner, who has no background in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's early,'' to give up on Justin, said Jones, adding, ``Paul
has always been willing to take chances; it's a part of his game.
But I think he's taking risks that he wouldn't normally take in a
regular-season game.''
</P>
<P>
   But keep in mind that the No. 3 quarterback job isn't a tall
order of business in making up a 53-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   That works for Justin, as well as it works against him. The
rookie comes cheaper. nn

NFL AMERICAN BOWL TRANSLATES INTO A FARCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Gil LeBreton 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A news dispatch last week from league headquarters reminded us
that Saturday night's Cowboys-Falcons skirmish was the 10th NFL
exhibition game to be played in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   My response is, shhhh _ I won't tell the United Nations if you
guys won't.
</P>
<P>
   Let me get this straight. They send us dependable cars, raw
fish, state-of-the-art TVs and ``Iron Chef'' reruns.
</P>
<P>
   And we send them Tony Graziani at quarterback and Emmitt Smith
in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a bad exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL persists in calling these international matches of
mystery the ``American Bowl,'' as if this was Commissioner Paul
Tagliabue's annual entry in the Nobel Peace Prize sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, lest anyone forget, played in the original American
Bowl, circa 1986. They practiced in London's Hyde Park, posed with
the palace guards, and played the Chicago Bears in a game that was
a novelty until, oh, the third quarter, when the Wembley Stadium
crowd began doing soccer chants.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys lost that night, 17-6, and have squandered every
foray onto foreign soil since _ no wins, seven losses, one tie.
Despite that, owner Jerry Jones issued the obligatory ``proud to
serve as ambassadors'' pronouncement, and Atlanta president Taylor
Smith allowed that it was great to ``experience the rich culture of
Japan and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure if he said that before or after the $165
room-service bill.
</P>
<P>
   My point is the American Bowl is an idea that has run its course
as an annual phenomenon. Especially when it co-stars the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance reflects a declining interest. The last time that
the Cowboys played in the Tokyo Dome, August of '92, they lost to
the then-Houston Oilers in front of 51,058. The crowd Saturday was
announced as 42,178, and the empty seats were conspicuous on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices for Cowboys-Falcons ranged from a $50 cheap seat
to $500 for so-called VIP seating. Let me suggest, therefore, that
the novelty has worn off.
</P>
<P>
   To us American ``gaijin'', the language barrier is daunting. But
the Japanese appear to have wisely figured it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Bowl'' translates to ``exhibition'' football, and
after years of watching teams of U.S. baseball players saunter
through on meaningless exhibition tours, the Japanese know all
about the e-word.
</P>
<P>
   NFL exhibition games are ripoffs in this country. Packaging them
for foreign lands probably violates the Geneva Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL isn't going to expand into Tokyo or London, so what's
the point here?
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to disrupt training camp _ more on that later _ and
travel 15 hours each way, just for the sake of marketing exposure,
Owner Jones is doing his team a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Cowboys arrived home yesterday, for instance,
sporting a Mount Fuji-sized case of jet lag. Practices in Wichita
Falls will be predictably sluggish for the rest of the week. Add
the two days lost while in the air, plus the minimal
season-preparation work that was done in Tokyo, and coach Dave
Campo's team has lost a valuable stretch of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that they can overcome it. The first Cowboys
team that played in Tokyo went on to win the Super Bowl. But in his
first camp as head coach, Campo needs some questions answered, and
this was a bad time to take a week off.
</P>
<P>
   The good people of Japan might be too polite to admit it, but
they're probably tired of the NFL sending them bad preseason fish
and charging Kobe steak prices. Baseball finally caught on, and
when they sent the Cubs and Mets to Tokyo in March to play real,
regular-season games, the Japanese people embraced the gesture.
Both games in the Tokyo Dome were 55,000-seat sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL really wants to spread its goodwill, it should
schedule one annual regular-season game across the seas. The people
of Japan would acknowledge the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The current format just doesn't translate anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Or is the league too busy selling American Bowl T-shirts to
notice? nn

 &HT;    MINE INSPECTIONS LAG(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By CRAIG HARRIS(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months after the death of Jose Villanueva in a southern
Arizona underground copper mine, state Mine Inspector Doug Martin
is the first to admit he doesn't have enough inspectors to
thoroughly examine the 547 mining operations under his
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Asarco's mine in Sahaurita, where Villanueva was
killed in a rock fall Jan. 31, was thoroughly and properly
inspected the state-mandated four times last year, even though some
other mines weren't checked. And he said the Asarco underground
mine has been inspected this year.
</P>
<P>
   But since a shakeup in his office two years ago, Martin's staff
has conducted just roughly more than half of the required number of
inspections to surface and underground mines, and sand and gravel
pits, according to a report with the state Legislative Budget
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the reason just 56 percent of the required
inspections occurred in 1998 and only 61 percent happened last year
is because he has a small, inexperienced staff.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his office's recent battle with civil suits is
forcing inspectors out of the field and into courtrooms. This year,
he hopes to conduct 67 percent of the required inspections and have
100 percent by 2003, once his staff gains experience and the
Legislature gives him more personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was elected in 1988, blames part of his problems on
lawmakers for not giving him more than four full-time inspectors
and a chief deputy inspector who have to canvass the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   House Appropriations Chairman Bob Burns, R-Glendale, said Martin
is to blame because he promoted three of his best field inspectors
to administrative jobs two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take your top performers off the line and put them
behind a desk, that's not the way the budget is supposed to work,''
Burns said. ``If he had positions in his office, he should have
sought those and not moved inspectors. He has a communications
problem when making his requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the three promoted inspectors - Operations Manager
Lawrence Nelson, Chief Deputy Inspector David Hamm and Assistant
State Mine Inspector Phil Howard - still conduct inspections on a
part-time basis in addition to their administrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also said he has had to train three new inspectors in the
last year, after three experienced inspectors retired and another
one was fired. Before 1998, his office had conducted all of the
required inspections three of the previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understaffing is the problem. Each year we request an increase
in personnel but it hasn't happened,'' Martin said. ``The
constitution only requires me. It doesn't say how many people I
have to have. So I try to convince the Legislature what I need to
do my job efficiently. I usually get a memo saying there are no new
funds available, therefore there's no increase in employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Mine Inspector's Office was created in 1912, when
Arizona became a state and mining was the major industry. The sole
purpose then was simple: Protect miners.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Martin said safety is his priority but his office has
limited regulatory powers.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows his office to issue citations, and it can shut
down an operation for safety hazards. Only once has Martin
temporarily shut down a mining operation, and his office cannot
assess financial penalties. But even if his office had that
authority, Martin said, he wouldn't use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with the policy of fines,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said fines create a negative relationship with the
companies, and he would rather have that money used to correct
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get those funds turned back into a safe practice, then
we have done a good job,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy clearly is not shared with the U.S. Mine Safety
and Health Administration, which assesses fines of $55 to $55,000,
depending on the severity of problems. MSHA can issue citations if
inspectors find loose rock, poor ventilation, noise problems or
vehicle defects.
</P>
<P>
   Although both the state and federal governments inspect mines in
Arizona, they are independent of each other and typically do not
share information. Federal inspections carry more weight because of
the power to assess fines, as well as the ability to shut down a
mine. MSHA can inspect any mine unannounced at any time if safety
complaints are made, but it typically inspects mines quarterly, as
it does with Asarco.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, MSHA is expected to announce the full
amount of fines it will assess on Asarco for the 26 violations it
found following the Jan. 31 accident that killed Villanueva and
severely injured Joe Olson and Javier Vargas. The state, however,
cited just minor violation during its two inspections following the
accident. The injured miners and Villanueva's family are seeking
multimillion-dollar settlements from the state. If they don't get
it, they say will sue Martin's office.
</P>
<P>
   Asarco, which was bought last year by mining giant Grupo Mexico,
was fined $40,000 by MSHA after a worker was electrocuted in 1997
at the Sahaurita mine south of Tucson. After appealing, the company
paid $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davitt McAteer, the top MSHA official and an assistant Labor
Department secretary, said the federal government assesses fines to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes certain the conditions for a violation do not
exist,'' said McAteer, noting the practice is like a police officer
writing a speeding ticket. ``They serve as a reminder and
encouragement to continue to have a mine violation-free.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, however, isn't alone when it comes to limited powers.
</P>
<P>
   Montana and Nevada also issue citations but can't fine mines. Of
the six Western mining states of similar size, only Wyoming
assesses fines, but the practice is rare. Colorado, New Mexico and
Utah have no regulatory authority over mines and leave that job to
MSHA. And only Nevada, with its 11 inspectors, has more inspectors
than Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona law requires an underground mine, such as Asarco's, to
be inspected each quarter, but Martin said his staff doesn't look
at the entire mine.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said just certain parts are inspected, and by the
end of the year an inspector may have looked at all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be impossible with four people to look at all 547
operations,'' Martin said. ``The other thing is a mine is mining
all the time. Therefore, we might be there the first week of July,
and by the time we are there the next quarter, a whole area could
be mined out. {hellip} There is no way we could be there day by
day.''

<P>
   He has what many 10-year-old boys only dream of - a Sony
PlayStation, a snare drum set, his own VCR and enough Michael
Jordan paraphernalia to create a shrine to the retired Chicago
Bulls basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   But what this Phoenix fifth-grader lacks is what every boy wants
and needs: his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whose name is being withheld at his family's request,
is a victim of a growing problem in Arizona and the rest of the
country. He is among an estimated 200,000 children in the country
with mothers in prison. In Arizona, about 1,300, or 71 percent, of
the women in prison have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are children that are at risk for all kinds of
problems,'' said Cynthia Seymour, an attorney for the Child Welfare
League of America in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour was quick to add that not all children with prison moms
will wind up living in poverty, developing emotional problems,
falling behind in school, abusing drugs and alcohol or getting into
trouble with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Although all are a possibility, assuming children will wind up
in trouble further stigmatizes them, Seymour said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no doubt that the growing ranks of women in prison
means an increasing number of children on the outside who are
negatively affected, she said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has studied the effect in depth, but anecdotal evidence
indicates that most children whose moms are sent to prison are
being raised by their grandmothers, usually their mother's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if it weren't for his maternal grandmother, the Phoenix
boy would be without parents for the next 41/2 years until his
mother, Tracy James, is released from prison. James, who stabbed
her fianci to death during a domestic violence fight, has been in
jail since her only child began kindergarten. The boy's natural
father lives out of state and has never played a role in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been traumatized a lot in this situation,'' said James,
32, who is serving time at the Arizona State Prison Complex in
Perryville. She allowed a reporter to talk to her son and her
mother on the condition that neither would be identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard on children; they feel abandoned,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   When James first went to prison, her son became angry and
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The boy used to see a child psychologist. But today, he seems
well adjusted, spending time playing basketball, video games and
watching movies like (beginitalic)Billy Madison(enditalic) - a
reward recently for cleaning up his room, where a picture of him
and his mother hangs above his bunk bed.(beginitalic)
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)The boy used to call his grandmother ``momma'' until
James put a stop to it. He calls her ``Grammie'' now and isn't shy
about holding her hand as they shop Paradise Valley Mall or daring
her to go on the scariest rides at Water World.
</P>
<P>
   The two visit James every other Sunday, although occasionally,
the boy chooses not to make the hourlong trip.
</P>
<P>
   When the boy does visit, he and James usually play Yahtzee and
eat pizza and soda pop out of the prison's vending machines. The
boy also gets to sit on James' lap and hug her - something they
were prevented from doing for a year after James was first
incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   James tries to be a mother to her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've mothered my son from behind these walls,'' she said. ``I
tell him, `I'm your mother regardless of where I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's grandmother agrees: ``She has a lot of influence, even
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the mother-son relationship is never rocky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes he's angry at her,'' the boy's grandmother
said. ``He hung up on her twice this week, once by accident and
once on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   James said she understands the anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't replace these years,'' she said. ``I can never get
these back.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son is looking forward to the day he can live with his
mother again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He counts my time by Halloween. He'll say, `In so many
Halloweens, my Mom will be out,''' James said.
</P>
<P>
   But the reunion could bring its own trouble. James wants to move
out of Arizona and make a fresh start, which means her son would
have to leave Grammie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets concerned about where they'll go,'' his grandmother
said. ``I tell him that I'll just get on a plane and come visit
him, or that he can come visit me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the time comes, it will be really rough.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir Alec Guinness, the elegant and versatile British actor known
to older audiences for films like ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
and to a whole new generation for his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in
``Star Wars,'' died late Saturday at a hospital in West Sussex,
England. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Possessing a plain-as-porridge but chameleonlike face, Guinness
was one of those gifted actors who left audiences awed with his
seemingly effortless, perfect performances, which he carried off
with quiet subtlety and undemonstrative skill.
</P>
<P>
   Although his notable career encompassed the stage and
television, it was in motion pictures that a much wider audience
found Guinness unforgettable almost from the moment he first
appeared on screen.
</P>
<P>
   He was a most versatile performer, capable of playing a wide
range of roles, beginning in 1946, when he was Herbert Pocket in
the movie adaptation of Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations.'' He
delighted millions with his wittily etched, tour-de-force
delineations of 10 members of an eccentric English family
(including a spinster and a character in an oil painting) in ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' in 1949. And he developed a cult following
for his merry antics in ``The Lavender Hill Mob'' and ``The
Captain's Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his most memorable dramatic roles was the driven
regimental colonel in postwar Scotland in ``Tunes of Glory.'' And
another military role, as the slightly mad military prig of a
colonel in ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, won him an
Academy Award. He was knighted in the late 1950s by Queen
Elizabeth, but still had a long career ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was often said that as a master of disguise he was
an actor with no face of his own, it was, in fact, the intelligent
use of his malleable features that served him so extraordinarily
well. In situations where lesser performers required several lines
of dialogue to accomplish an effect, Guinness used his own facial
shorthand _ the faint curling of a lip, a seemingly apologetic
furrowing of the brow, the quizzical upturn of an eyebrow, the
slight but visible widening of the eyes in disbelief, a sudden
brief smile that could radiate approval or signify chilly disdain.
Particularly in motion-picture close-up, he did not so much act as
allow his face to react to what another actor was saying.
</P>
<P>
   He was the antithesis of the personality player or star, for he
accepted small and large roles that ranged from the starkly
dramatic to the predictably melodramatic to the maniacally
whimsical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done has been on the spur of the moment,'' the
actor said some years ago. ``That's why my career has been so
haphazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Haphazard or not, it was a notable career, one in which Guinness
triumphed in the theater in roles as startlingly dissimilar as
Hamlet and the suave psychiatrist in T.S. Eliot's ``Cocktail
Party.'' He was the drink-sodden and doomed Welsh poet Dylan Thomas
in Sidney Michaels' biographical drama ``Dylan'' and the tragically
broken and brainwashed prelate in ``The Cardinal.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played a Japanese businessman in ``A Majority of One''
in 1962, the same year that he was seen as the Arab prince, Feisal,
in ``Lawrence of Arabia.'' He had business savvy as well _ for his
memorable role in the 1977 blockbuster ``Star Wars,'' he received a
percentage of the gross.
</P>
<P>
   Guinness was born in London on April 2, 1914. He was often
mistaken for one of the ``brewery Guinnesses,'' he said, and in his
adulthood several members of that family of millionaires cultivated
his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, ``Blessings in Disguise,'' published in
the United States in 1986, Guinness cleared up longtime speculation
as to whether he was an illegitimate child. He was indeed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My birth certificate registers me as Alec Guinness de Cuffe,''
he wrote. ``My mother at the time was a Miss Agnes Cuffe; my
father's name is left an intriguing, speculative blank. When I was
five years old my mother married an army captain, a Scot named
David Stiven, and from then until I left preparatory school I was
known as Alec Stiven (a name I rather liked, although I hated and
dreaded my stepfather).''
</P>
<P>
   His mother's ``violently unhappy marriage'' lasted only three
years, ending when Stiven was posted to New Zealand, Guinness said.
</P>
<P>
   At Pembroke Lodge, a boarding school, the headmaster discouraged
the youth from student theatricals by telling him, ``You're not the
acting type,'' but later, at Roborough School in Eastbourne, he won
the role of the breathless messenger in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The skinny, wild-eyed boy prepared for his bit part the night of
the performance by running around the football field twice, timing
himself to dash through the auditorium's side door and run onstage
at the moment of his cue (``Enter a Messenger'') and collapse in
front of Macbeth. ``Gracious,'' he genuinely gasped, ``my lord
(gulp!), I should report (gasp!) that which I ...'' The schoolboy
audience burst into applause, and that night an actor was born.
</P>
<P>
   His schooling finished in 1932, he went to work as an apprentice
copywriter in a London advertising agency. ``The very first thing I
did was on impulse to phone Martita Hunt and ask her to give me
acting lessons,'' he recalled years later. ``After a few lessons
she sent me packing.'' In fact, after 12 lessons, Hunt, a renowned
actress who later played Habersham with him in ``Great
Expectations,'' told the drab and emaciated young man in 1933,
``You'll never make an actor, Mr. Guinness.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the would-be actor applied to the Fay Compton
Studio of Dramatic Art, which gave him a modest scholarship, and he
was able to study and live on a single baked-beans-on-toast meal a
day. He went to classes but augmented his training by following
Londoners about, mimicking their gait, their traits and their
gestures _ all of which would be put to good use in a brilliant
career to come.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he found the studio tiresome. ``We did
dancing and singing in the mornings,'' he recalled later. ``Tap
dancing was very much in vogue then so I'm afraid we did an awful
lot of that. In the afternoons it was drama, and I remember we were
taught that there was a correct and an incorrect way of executing
the most detailed stage business.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness left the Compton Studio after seven months, but not
before an annual recital at which the judges, John Gielgud among
them, awarded him a major prize. In the years to come he was to
refer often to the older actor as ``the great hero of my youth,''
and in fact on more than one occasion the older man helped him
along in his career, encouraging him and offering him money when he
needed it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, literally a starving young actor, Guinness got work in
a lurid shipboard melodrama called ``Queer Cargo,'' in which he
played three small roles. Then Gielgud gave him his first big
break, casting him as Osric and the Third Player in the Gielgud
production of ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My theater tide began to come in because of Sir John's
generosity, for from that point on I was never truly out of a job
unless I wanted it that way,'' Guinness recalled in 1982. He was
from the start a sort of critics' darling _ one called his Osric in
``Hamlet'' an ``admirable popinjay,'' and later his Sir Andrew
Aguecheek in ``Twelfth Night'' was pronounced ``a collector's
item.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 24 he played his first Hamlet in a Tyrone Guthrie
production at the Old Vic, and although it was, on the whole, an
ego-chastening experience, one critic kindly conceded that if the
young actor's Hamlet was short on force, his performance was
``touched with sweetness and an aching sincerity.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his apprenticeship under John Gielgud, whose London company
he had joined in 1937, Guinness said, ``Working with him in the
'30s was a great and good discipline because his precision demanded
the same from you.'' And, he said: ``Going into Tyrone Guthrie
productions on the other hand was a great liberating influence. He
could relax you as an actor where Gielgud could make you feel
stiff. I was extraordinarily fortunate to be oscillating between
these opposite poles.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, a quietly modest man known for his unelaborate
courtesy, was equally grateful to others in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martita Hunt had been the first truly sophisticated person I
had met, and she developed in me a sense of taste,'' he said in an
interview. ``So did Edith Evans, from whom I learnt things of value
technically.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a producer and later director at the Old Vic, he
said, ``Michel Saint-Denis, on the other hand, woke me up to what
theater was really all about and was the first person to give me a
sense of reality for the words I was speaking. Gielgud, Guthrie,
Martita Hunt, Edith Evans, Michel Saint-Denis _ they were the
formative people in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before enlisting in the Royal Navy in 1941, the actor had
learned many lessons well, having played 34 parts in 23 plays by
Shakespeare, Pinero, Chekhov, Shaw and Sheridan. ``It was
obvious,'' Tyrone Guthrie said about that period, ``that he was
going to be tremendously talented. It was not so obvious that he
was going to be so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' ``war'' was distinguished only by an incident that
might have made a vignette in a Guinness comedy. In the invasion of
Sicily, the actor-turned-landing-craft-skipper was actually the
first person ashore, a nonheroic deed of derring-don't blamed
entirely on an hour's error in orders. When the admiral in charge
blustered his way ashore at last, the young Guinness is said to
have blandly assured him that such tardy timing of an entrance
would never be tolerated in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   On being mustered out, he resumed his writing and stage career
in the role of Mitya in his own version of Dostoyevski's ``Brothers
Karamazov,'' an artistic success that failed at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   His other stage appearances in the postwar period included roles
in Sartre's ``Vicious Circle,'' the Dauphin in Shaw's ``Saint
Joan'' and the title role in Shakespeare's ``Richard II.'' Of the
last, the critic for The Sunday Express of London wrote: `` Mr.
Guinness is slight, with an interesting angular face and a clear,
flexible voice. He has dignity, but no majesty; he has range and
control, but no surprises. He is intensely good without being great
_ yet. His future may bring that.''
</P>
<P>
   Having played so many classical roles, Guinness decided it was
time to tackle the movies, commenting, ``On the stage I never seem
to have a chance to wear trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been an extra in his first movie, ``Evensong,'' in 1934,
and remembered it as ``a horrible experience.'' But in 1946, the
director David Lean cast him as Pocket in the now-classic film
version of ``Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 Lean allowed him to play an extremely wicked Fagin in a
controversial version of ``Oliver Twist,'' whose release in the
United States was held up for more than two years because of
pressure brought by groups that considered the Guinness
characterization anti-Semitic. The U.S. version was also censored,
but among moviegoers worldwide, Alec Guinness had clinched his
claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Now much in demand on the screen, in 1949 he made ``A Run for
Your Money'' and ``Kind Hearts and Coronets''; in the latter, he
played several members of a dotty family who fall prey to a
murderous relative. It was that set of performances that forever
sealed the actor's reputation as a rubber-faced British zany in the
tradition of Sir Harry Lauder. He was thenceforth to be hailed as
the actor who could play any part.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he also created the role of the seemingly omniscient
psychiatrist in T.S. Eliot's ``Cocktail Party'' at the Edinburgh
Festival, and the following year went with it to Broadway, where
his performance bowled over critics and audiences alike.
</P>
<P>
   His first films were making him famous and moderately wealthy,
but he fancied himself rather a tragedian than a comedian and, once
more, in 1951, assayed ``Hamlet'' on the West End, directing the
play himself and presenting the tragic Dane as cold, existential
and matter of fact. The flop, which he was to brood over for years,
propelled him more and more into movies.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1950s films he was a shrewdly wary Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli in ``The Mudlark''; a droopy-lidded, bowlered and
bespectacled bank clerk who engineers the smuggling of a hoard of
gold bullion out of England in ``The Lavender Hill Mob''; and, in
``The Man in the White Suit,'' a chemist single-mindedly devoted to
developing a miracle fabric that would never soil or wear out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet another choice comedy role came in 1953 in ``The Captain's
Paradise,'' when he played a Mediterranean ferryboat skipper who
commutes between wives as well as ports. Audiences found him less
appealing in the serious role of a love-smitten flier in ``The
Malta Story'' (1954), but delighted in his sly, quietly mirthful
charm as G.K. Chesterton's priestly sleuth Father Brown in ``The
Detective,'' also in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came ``The Ladykillers'' in 1955, closely followed by
his first Hollywood film, a glossily cold remake of Molnar's ``The
Swan'' in which he starred with Grace Kelly. Unlike many of his
compatriots who despised Hollywood, Guinness said, ``I found it
warm in every way, and would have stayed on had there been work for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In his greatest film triumph, ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,''
Guinness was called upon to be ``both admirable and tiresome,'' he
said, as the fascinatingly paradoxical Colonel Nicholson, a British
officer interned in a hellish Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in
Burma. He made Nicholson at times infuriating, at times pitiable, a
man whose strict adherence to an old-fashioned code of military
ethics was both his scourge and his moral salvation.
</P>
<P>
   His next film, ``All at Sea,'' was a light change of pace in
which he played a mal de mer-prone descendant of a long line of
naval heroes, the sort of role the actor could by then play in his
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Such could not be said of his full- rounded portrayal of Gulley
Jimson in ``The Horse's Mouth,'' a Swiftian satire in which he was
an unkempt old rogue of a painter so obsessed by his art that he
had no regard for the feelings or needs of anyone who dared impinge
on his creativity. Guinness received an Academy Award nomination,
not for his acting, which was splendid, but for the screenplay he
wrote from the novel by Joyce Cary.
</P>
<P>
   Other film roles included ``The Comedians,'' ``The Quiller
Memorandum,'' ``A Christmas Carol'' and Franco Zeffirelli's
``Brother Sun, Sister Moon,'' none of which reversed the descending
trend of the actor's film fortunes in the early 1970s. In 1976,
however, he easily stole all his scenes in Neil Simon's ``Murder by
Death,'' a mystery spoof in which he played a blind butler Although
films occupied most of his time, Guinness did not entirely desert
the stage. He opened Canada's Shakespeare Festival in Stratford,
Ontario, in 1953, appearing as ``Richard III.'' In London the
following year he was praised for his harrowing performance in
``The Prisoner,'' Bridget Boland's intense study of the
brainwashing of a Roman Catholic cardinal in an Iron-Curtain
country. (He made the film version in 1955.) He was also seen
onstage as a would-be adulterer in Feydeau's ``Hotel Paradiso'' in
1956 and in 1960 had the title role in Terence Rattigan's ``Ross,''
a portrait of the enigmatic T.E. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest success on Broadway came in 1964, when Peter
Glenville prodded him into taking the tricky and difficult title
role in ``Dylan,'' an anecdotal drama dealing with the
self-destructive poet Dylan Thomas' last liquor-sodden months.
Guinness was the antithesis in character of the Welsh poet, but he
gave a performance so heartwrenchingly sad that he won almost every
available acting prize that season. The critic Walter Kerr termed
the performance ``mesmerizing,'' adding, ``There is a still center
in the actor, a coal in the ashes that defies us to will our eyes
away.'' (Years later, commenting on a trifling play superbly acted
by Guinness in London, Kerr, not content with the title Queen
Elizabeth II had conferred on the actor, dubbed him ``St. Alec.'')
</P>
<P>
   Guinness' appearances on television were rare but memorable. His
most notable achievement was the character of George Smiley, the
retired British intelligence officer he created in two multipart
series seen in Britain and the United States in the early 1980s _
``Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ``Smiley's People,'' written
by John le Carre. His understated characterization of the aging,
spiritually burnt-out and forlorn former spy underscored his
reputation as ``an actor who makes you forget that he is acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his acting technique, Kenneth Tynan, the late critic, writer
and director, once said: ``My point is that the people Guinness
plays best are all iceberg characters, nine-tenths concealed, whose
fascination lies not in how they look but in how their minds work.
The parts he plays are, so to speak, injected hypodermically, not
tattooed all over him; the latter is the star's way, and Guinness
shrinks from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor was mildly amused by such esoteric analyses of his
art. ``I have no ax to grind, and no interesting theories to
propound,'' he said. ``If a play comes my way which appeals to me
and which I am free to do, I do it. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, one sort of script he avoided, the sort
proffered with the assurance, ``It was written just for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I was a little abrupt recently with a producer who
sent me a screenplay,'' he once confessed. ``It was rubbish,
really. I sent it back with a polite rejection. Then he came back
with the plea that `we tailored it just for you.' I replied simply,
`But no one came to take the measurements.'''
</P>
<P>
   Guinness, who had been almost bald since his late 20s, was often
described as ``dignified'' and ``shy'' and ``quiet, unassuming.''
He lived modestly in an unpretentious house in Hampshire, in the
south of England, with his wife, Merula Salaman, a former actress.
They were married in 1938 when both were appearing as animals in
John Gielgud's production of ``Noah.'' They had a son, Matthew.

OFF-THE-WALL LOSS FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ROYALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Lansing hit The Wall, one of the most unforgiving
edifices in America. And no sooner did the newest Red Sox second
baseman Sunday plunk his first ball off the storied structure than
he joined a long, inglorious list of its victims.
</P>
<P>
   Narrowly gunned down trying to turn a Wallball single into a
double, Lansing cost the Red Sox a crucial, leadoff runner in the
ninth, accidentally casting himself as a symbol of Boston's weekend
of missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, the Kansas City Royals rolled out of the Hub
with a 3-1 victory, their second straight of the three-game series.
The Red Sox, still weary from a West Coast swing last week, headed
back across the continent for six games in Anaheim and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees, who also lost Sunday, still held a 3 1/2-game
lead over the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Red Sox stranded 20 runners in their back-to-back
losses to the Royals, including two in the ninth inning Sunday
after Lansing's rude introduction to the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   The lost chances helped to squander another strong outing by Tim
Wakefield (6-6), who allowed only two earned runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of been the story of the year,'' said catcher Scott
Hatteberg. ``There have been some great pitching performances and
we've been unable to score some runs. It's a trend we have to
change. Time is running out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, coming off an eight-inning effort in the 19-inning
``Sleepless in Seattle'' game last week, has pitched six or more
innings in his last eight starts, solidifying his spot as the
team's most dependable starter other than Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Wakefield is winless in his last four outings, as the Sox
have failed to score more than five runs in any of the games,
including the 19-inning epic. This time, Wakefield concluded, ``I
just got outpitched.''
</P>
<P>
   By a guy named Dan Reichert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many people know about him,'' said right fielder
Trot Nixon, who managed one of Boston's seven hits off the rookie
righthander. ``But the guy's got outstanding stuff, a sinker that
just moves like I've never seen, and power. He has the ability to
dominate with those pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did for eight innings, scattering those seven hits and
three walks. Only two Boston hitters reached third base, Nixon, who
was stranded there in the third inning, and Nomar Garciaparra, who
passed through on his home-run trot after launching a solo shot to
center in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra went 2 for 4, improving his average to .394. He tied
the score, 1-1, with the homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals scored an unearned run in the first when Johnny Damon
singled, moved to second on Rey Sanchez's ground out, and ambled
home when left fielder Troy O'Leary misplayed Jermaine Dye's
routine fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it got caught in the sun,'' manager Jimy Williams
said. For O'Leary, it was only his second error of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After Garciaparra's homer, his 17th, Kansas City countered in
the eighth. Carlos Febles led off by dinging a single off the
scoreboard and stealing second. Damon, who has torn apart the Sox
this year with a .542 average against them, followed by bunting
safely down the third-base line, advancing Febles to third.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it for Wakefield, who had thrown only 92 pitches
and felt strong enough to continue. But Williams turned to Hipolito
Pichardo, one of the bullpen's sinkerballer stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he can get a ground ball and get a double play,''
Williams said, explaining his move.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo got the ground ball, from Sanchez. But it rolled too
slowly to third, allowing Manny Alexander to get only the force at
second, and Febles scored the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   After Mike Sweeney singled, Dye knocked in Sanchez, making it
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox stranded two in the bottom of the inning and began the
ninth with Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   In the postgame autopsy of the inning, Williams considered what
might have been had Lansing, a career National Leaguer until the
Sox acquired him from Colorado 11 days ago, survived The Wall.
``Two runs down, leadoff hitter on first, three outs to go,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lansing charged around first without the green light from
coach Tommy Harper. ``I thought I could get there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he believes he did get there. He slid head-first into
the bag as Febles applied the tag. ``I know I did, and I don't need
to see a replay,'' he said. ``He tagged me on my ribs and my hand
was on the base.''
</P>
<P>
   Lansing protested briefly, without assistance from Williams or
Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he said he stood by his decision to take the risk.
``It's just the way I play,'' said Lansing, a hard-nosed throwback
sort of player. ``I understood the situation, but I also understood
that I thought I had a good chance to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The out was pivotal because the next batter, Rico Brogna,
singled to center, as did the next, pinch hitter Jason Varitek.
Lansing would have scored on the second hit, there would have been
no outs, and the Sox likely would have been able to send Carl
Everett to the plate, if not Garciaparra, before the inning ended.
</P>
<P>
   But Nixon flied out for the second out and Brian Daubach
grounded out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some chances to score, we sure did,'' Williams said.
``We just couldn't get those hits with guys in scoring position.
Out of 162 games, it's bound to happen. But I guess it gets
magnified when the games are close.''

STRONG SEASON WOULD BE REAL KICK FOR VINATIERI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Adam Vinatieri pointed to an ugly rug burn on
his left arm. Painful, yes, but a price well paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desmond,'' said Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond?
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't going to happen again,'' the Patriots kicker said.
``Desmond wasn't going to run back another one on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some memories never fade.
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri had blasted the opening kickoff to the Detroit Lions
Friday night in the Pontiac Silverdome and there, waiting on the
goal line, was none other than Desmond Howard. And when the
returner eluded the first wave of Patriots, then the next, and
headed toward the left sideline, Vinatieri was New England's
tackler of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desmond headed to the outside,'' said Vinatieri, ``and I saw
him coming. I said, `Uh-oh.' Then I said, `Not today.' I wanted to
make sure he didn't get me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Vinatieri, nor most Patriots fans, can forget what
Howard did in Super Bowl XXX. New England had just cut Green Bay's
lead to 27-21 in the third quarter, the momentum swinging to the
Patriots, when Vinatieri kicked off to Howard.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Vinatieri was illegally blocked by a Packer on
Howard's return, but he then was the last hope for a tackle.
Howard, though, whizzed past him on a 99-yard return that
effectively ended the Super Bowl for New England. The Patriots
never could recover from Howard's TD return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to make sure it didn't happen again,'' said
Vinatieri, one of the better tacklers among kickers in the National
Football League. ``And this time I got him.''
</P>
<P>
   And the nasty rug burn in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But it was what Vinatieri did on the last play of the half
Friday night and the next-to-last play of the game that should
encourage Patriots fans more than Vinatieri's tackle of Howard. At
the end of the half, Vinatieri kicked a 50-yard field goal, and, at
game's end, he kicked the winning 28-yard field goal, giving New
England a 13-10 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if game-winning field goals are ever routine,''
said Vinatieri, ``but it was good to hit it. I know preseason games
don't mean anything in the standings, but it was good to hit the
field goal and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   New England's dismal 8-8 season of 1999 might have been a more
healthy 10-6 if Vinatieri hadn't missed two makable late field
goals, against Kansas City and Buffalo. Indeed, the Patriots also
could have been 11-5 if tight end Ben Coates hadn't dropped a
third-down pass against the Dolphins at Foxboro Stadium just before
the two-minute mark of the fourth quarter. Coates, though, dropped
the ball, Miami gained possession, and soon came from behind and
won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget those (missed field goals vs. the Chiefs and
Bills),'' said Vinatieri. ``It keeps you honest and it keeps you
working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, aside from all the X's and O's of a new coaching staff,
the key question is how well two of the main point-makers for New
England _ Vinatieri and quarterback Drew Bledsoe _ have recovered
their confidence from the battering of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Even more, it seems that Vinatieri may decide more than a few
games this season since it seems the New England defense is so
strong it won't allow opposing teams to get very far ahead and the
offense is so weak it won't be scoring enough points to give the
team a comfortable lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to put (the missed kicks) deep in the back of my
head and out of mind,'' said Vinatieri. ``Kickers have to have
short memories, good or bad. You just have to go out and kick the
next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri said 50 yards is more or less his limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit that (50-yarder) well,'' said Vinatieri. ``We had good
execution, the blocking was good, the snap was good, and the hold
was good. The ball just kind of went for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was kicked inside the domed home of the Lions
(interestingly, the wind inside the Silverdome was listed at 1 mile
per hour). Outside, and in normal conditions, Vinatieri said, his
range should be close to 50 yards, give or take a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how well you're hitting the ball,'' he said,
``and how well you're hitting them that day. Obviously, there are
days when you feel there's no distance too far and then there are
other days. Friday was one of those days that, in my pregame kicks,
I was moving back to 53 and 54 yards and I felt pretty
comfortable.''

   You can hear it in the voice of UConn football coach Randy
Edsall as he talks about building a program from virtually ground
zero, with the selling point to new recruits a simple one: ``Help
create a tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   It still takes more imagination and vision than anything else to
focus on the complete picture simply because there is as yet no
tangible evidence of the Huskies' jump to Division 1-A in football.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly a decade of ``almosts,'' ``what ifs,'' and more
than a few ``if onlys,'' UConn will be off and running in a fast
new lane in September, when it makes its grand entrance into 1-A
football Sept. 2 at Eastern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, I can't believe it,'' said Perkins, the
long-suffering AD who has seen false start after false start
regarding plans for a new stadium _ the key issue in the project.
``I felt like a bride who had been to the altar so many times and
never got married. This is obviously exciting. But to be honest
with you, there were more than a few times when I didn't think it
was ever going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next five seasons, the Huskies will be a 1-A
independent, playing teams in the Big East, Mid-American
Conference, and any other 1-A powers looking for a game against
what most people _ at first _ believe will be a vulnerable program.
</P>
<P>
   Official entrance into the Big East on a round-robin basis will
not be until 2005, although the Huskies will play Big East schools
beginning this season _ UConn will play at Boston College Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, projected for 40,000 seats, will be ready for
the opener of the 2003 season.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring Edsall two years ago was the first major step toward
establishing a tradition. He had Big East ties at Syracuse and BC,
as well as NFL experience _ he was an assistant on Tom Coughlin's
staff at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiring Randy was important because of his background,'' said
Perkins, ``and because he had been in a transition program when
they were building the Jacksonville franchise. He knows what this
is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Edsall is not willing to take any shortcuts. ``The one thing I
learned under Tom was that no matter what people might say or what
happens at first, stick to your plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, UConn's plan has some logic. It will play eight games
against 1-A teams, then nine the next season, with the strength of
schedule peaking for the opening of the new stadium in 2003 when
Perkins wants at least one or two marquee teams to come to Hartford
to kick-start the enthusiasm for New England's second 1-A program.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins knows there is a delicate balance to scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be careful,'' he said, ``because now everybody
wants to play us. We want to be respectable.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn's track record suggests that will happen. The Huskies have
built solid programs in men's and women's sports, winning national
championships in men's and women's basketball the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment is there, so is the funding. With the stadium
issue settled, the Huskies believe they will have a showcase
facility to draw recruits to Storrs the same way basketball players
from all over the country have arrived the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting miracles any time soon. Unlike Marshall,
which went from being a dominant 1-AA team to a
much-better-than-average 1-A program overnight, the Huskies have
not dominated 1-AA _ they were 4-7 last season. In some preseason
rankings, the Huskies are ranked last out of 115 1-A teams for the
2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how you measure success,'' Perkins said. ``If we
can get to the point where we are competitive in the next five
years _ and by competitive I mean 4-7, 5-6, 6-5 _ we'll be all
right. Maybe we can catch a break and go 7-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins believes Hartford's failed flirtation with the New
England Patriots helped UConn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perverted way, losing the Patriots was a blessing in
disguise,'' he said. ``Because after that fell through, there was
sort of a void and we came along and filled it.''
</P>
<P>
   At 42, Edsall is just hitting his stride in coaching. His
apprenticeship, culminating in a two-year stint as the defensive
coordinator at Georgia Tech before he came to UConn, was geared
toward one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because I wanted to be a 1-A coach,'' he said.
``And I wanted to coach in the Big East.''
</P>
<P>
   In the jumbled and confused days and weeks following the
resignation of BC coach Dan Henning four years ago, Edsall thought
he would be coming back to the Eagles, where he had been an
assistant on Coughlin's staff for two years.
</P>
<P>
   But miscommunication, which was the operative term around The
Heights in those days, prevailed, and Edsall wound up at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is at UConn and he already has raised the battle flag to
BC and every other school that wants New England high school
talent. He expects UConn to be a major player, sooner rather than
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to face some tough times, no question,'' said
Edsall, who will be doing that when he fields a team that will have
only 10 seniors and 59 players who are either freshmen, redshirt
freshmen, or sophomores. ``But we have a plan and we're going to
stick with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Edsall said he would prioritize. First, he wants to shut the
border for any talent in Connecticut. ``We're going to fight tooth
and nail to keep those players,'' he said. ``Then, we have to go
into areas such as Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and get
some players out of there. Having recruited in that area and
knowing the coaches in the Big East, I know the strengths and
weaknesses of those programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The selling point will be basic. ``We're going to sell players
on the idea they can play right away,'' said Edsall. ``We're going
to tell them they can be a big fish in a little pond, rather than a
little fish in a big pond.''
</P>
<P>
   Edsall also knows he will be the point man for the program. ``I
have to go above and beyond what other coaches do in selling myself
and the idea of this program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He will do that by telling recruits in New England they have
another choice if they want to stay in the Northeast, not just
Syracuse, BC, and, to a lesser extent, Temple and Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal,'' he said with a laugh, ``is to go after recruits,
and when they take their five official visits, it's up to us to
make sure that UConn is one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   And he makes it clear he wants to be on the fast track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell them that we can win the Big East
championship and get a BCS (Bowl Championship Series) slot,'' he
said. ``We're in this to win, and to get to the highest level we
can get. I don't see why there has to be a limit on that.''

CAN WE CLOSE DOOR ON EVERETT INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The manager closing the door to his office is a
baseball tradition that can mean many things. Sometimes it's for a
happy occasion, other times it's an attempt to hide frustration.
Many times emotions come into play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Jimy Williams's office was merely a holding tank for
media members curious about Saturday's shouting match between
Williams and outfielder Carl Everett, who was returning from a
10-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Before going out to face the Royals Saturday, Everett found
himself behind a closed door in Williams's office. Perhaps he
thought Williams was going to praise him for keeping himself in
shape during his time away. Everett then would promise to continue
to be the .300 hitter the Sox had acquired and paid good money to
in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams had something else on his mind. According to
several sources, Williams didn't appreciate the fact that on an
offday last Thursday, Everett flew home to Tampa rather than fly
from Seattle to Boston. Williams bit his tongue until the
closed-door meeting. Then he lit into his star center fielder like
a Little League father slams into his very talented son. Everett
responded with strong language, which easily could be heard
throughout the locker room. Neither side prevailed, and all the
ramifications of the incident have not been felt.
</P>
<P>
   Williams surely will fine Everett for leaving the team. Although
general manager Dan Duquette signs the players and thus greatly
determines the Red Sox style of play by his selections, Williams
runs the show on and off the field. He oversees the good times and
the bad, and when decisions have to be made, he usually can be
found with his staff behind the closed door of his office.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox gave Everett a three-year contract worth $21 million and
expected him to be a staple, like shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. But
Everett's place in the lineup is determined by Williams, which
gives the manager some power. Everett may not totally accept that,
but to survive in Boston he must.
</P>
<P>
   Everett must look in the mirror and realize he is not the same
guy who came to town several months ago and impressed fans and
media eager to create another baseball legend. His recent behavior
has upset some fans, and he recently termed the media, after its
coverage of his July 15 bumping incident with umpire Ronald Kulpa,
``wolverines.'' Surely, he knows the media has been called worse.
The media are just professionals doing a job, just like he is.
</P>
<P>
   Everett reminds one in some ways of the combustible Oil Can
Boyd, the Sox pitcher who had early success but then saw his career
begin to slide. On Aug. 22, 1985, Boyd suffered a 5-3 loss to Texas
at Fenway Park. Once in the locker room, he began to berate his
teammates for their lack of support in close games. His language
was offensive and Jim Rice, who was hitting .265 at the time, took
particular offense to the fact that Boyd was paying more attention
to himself than his team. They exchanged insults and twice had to
be separated. After a third attempt to get at each other, Boyd was
hauled off behind a closed door. He went on to finish 15-13 that
season, but his rage cost him $1,530 and had a lasting negative
effect.
</P>
<P>
   After a career-best record of 16-10 in 1986, Boyd won only 13
games in the next three seasons and had more trouble off the field
than Carter has you know what. After Boston, Boyd pitched for
Montreal and Texas before retiring with only a 78-77 record.
Currently, he is barnstorming in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Texas.
It seems a waste.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's fine will be more than $1,530. He could wind up in
some employee assistance program, as did Boyd or more recently Wil
Cordero, who was accused of assault and battery against his wife.
The incident could cost Everett millions over the long haul, too.
That is not to say that Everett will fall apart in the near future.
But these days a player of his stature must be careful about public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Boyd said after his experience:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of being the center of controversy. As you all know,
I'm a very emotional player and sometimes my emotions are not fully
understood by others. My frustrations were not directed (at) anyone
in particular but rather the entire situation.''
</P>
<P>
   We're all tired of controversy, too. All you have to do is play
hard, Carl, try to catch the Yankees, and help bring an end to the
Curse of the Bambino. That's why you are here.
