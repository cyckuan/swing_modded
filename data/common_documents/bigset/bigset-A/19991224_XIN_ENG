<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russia, Georgia Trade Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Georgia have been
exchanging accusations against each other in a war of words that
escalated amid Moscow's military campaign against rebels in its
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Georgia of
helping Chechen militants, but Tbilisi denied the charges as "a
challenge to Georgia's sovereignty and independence."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Georgian parliament speaker Zurab Zhvania said the
Russian accusations were unprecedentedly "cynical, mendacious and
provocative," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two former Soviet republics have been blaming each other
for various things in the past, but the accusations usually came
from individual officials rather than in official government
statements.
</P>
<P>
Georgia sometimes pointed its finger at Russian secret services
for alleged plots to destabilize the country. It also accused
Moscow of supporting separatists in Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia
region. Russia has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
The past few months have witnessed several incidents where
Georgia accused Russia of firing on Georgian territory in its
military campaign against Chechen rebels. Moscow has admitted its
responsibility and given apologies for some of the incidents while
denying others.
</P>
<P>
In one of the latest such incident, Georgia said Russian
helicopters had shelled Georgian territory on November 17, but
Russia's foreign and defense ministries denied the accusations
Thursday in a joint statement, saying there were no evidence to
support Tbilisi's claims.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the work of Russian Defense Ministry experts
who were in Tbilisi on November 18 deny the version alleging that
Russian helicopters had shelled Georgian territory," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia borders Russia's Chechnya to its north. The Chechen
section of its borders with Georgia has been considered by Moscow
a weak point in its efforts to root out rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russia has said weapons and foreign mercenaries made their way
into Chechnya through the Georgian border, but Tbilisi denied such
accusations.
</P>
<P>
Georgia also rejected Russian proposals to stage a joint
protection of their common borders, saying it is fully capable of
safeguarding its own frontiers.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry, in its Tuesday statement, said by
rejecting Russia's proposal for jointly guarding the Chechen
section of their border, Tbilisi is opening "a window for
militants to receive arms and finances."
</P>
<P>
The statement also accused Georgia of providing a tribune for
Chechen missionaries' anti-Russian statements.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Russian federal forces said they have now
blocked several major roads linking Chechnya and Georgia, thereby
isolating the rebels from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi has been critical of Russia's military campaign against
rebels in the North Caucasus, although it shares Moscow's concerns
over terrorism. Georgia says the fighting in Chechnya is
threatening the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry's Tuesday statement has come under
fire from various Georgian government departments.
</P>
<P>
Zhvania, the parliament speaker, said behind that statement was
the fact that Georgia has demonstrated to the world in 1999 its
plans to become a full-fledged independent state "whose security
guarantees are not only in Russian hands," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry also responded sharply to the
Russian Foreign Ministry statement, describing it as an unfriendly
move "with far-reaching consequences."
</P>
<P>
"Such charges can only be qualified as cynical," says a
Georgian Foreign Ministry's statement circulated on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Georgian Foreign Ministry said it was surprised that "to
this day, Russia has not admitted that Russian planes have bombed
Georgian territory, and is still denying obvious facts" despite"
irrefutable proof and the evidence of eyewitness, including
diplomats and journalists accredited in Georgia," Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The latest attack on Georgian territory occurred on December
22, after the Russian Foreign Ministry issued its statement, as a
result of which four Georgian border guards were wounded," the
Georgian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"By blaming Georgia in all sins, Russia is hiding unceremonious
violations of Georgia's border. Russia is covering up bombardments
of Georgian villages by its own armed forces," Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze's international legal adviser Levan Aleksidze
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia should be ashamed for making such "absurd
statements that Georgia has turned into a Chechen add-on. They are
not based on concrete facts but on newspaper rumors."
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday that Moscow is considering the possibility of
introducing duties on products imported from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who visited
Moscow on Thursday, expressed worry that the conflict in Chechnya
could spill over into other countries in the greater Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov reaffirmed that
Russia will respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
the countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Russia also gave guarantees that it will refrain from
intervention and interference in the internal affairs of other
countries such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, Interfax quoted Talbott
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the war of words between Russia and
Georgia is likely to continue unabated for some time in the future,
observers say.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Govt Delegation Visits Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- An Ethiopian government
delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister
Tefera Waliwa is paying a three-day official visit to Russia,
Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Tefera met his Russian counterpart
Ilya kelbanov on Wednesday. Both Ethiopian Finance Minister
Sufian Ahmed and Russian Foreign Minister were present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tefera and his entourage are scheduled to hold talks with other
Russian government authorities, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Russia have been making efforts to consolidate
bilateral ties through high-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have been remarkably improved since Russia
agreed early this year to cancel 80 percent of the 35 billion
rubles (about 5.8 million U.S. dollars) it lent to Ethiopia for
arms purchasing when the African country was under the rule of
Mengistu Haile-Mariam.
</P>
<P>
The Ethio-Russian Joint Commission held its first meeting in
Moscow, Russia, in late November this year.
</P>
<P>
Agreements on trade and economic cooperation as well as
avoidance of double taxation were signed following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding on the protection and promotion
of investment and shipping lines were also signed during that
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Could Host Israeli-Syrian Talks: Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador to Cyprus
Shemi Tzur said Thursday that Cyprus could still host further
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Tzur told the CNA that, for later stage, "Cyprus could be a good
venue for the talks, it has close relations with both countries and
has a record of supporting the peace process in the region from the
beginning," Tzur said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed peace talks last week in Washington
after a 45-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides
had sent letters to his Syrian and Israeli counterparts, informing
them of Cyprus' readiness to host the talks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the relations between Cyprus and Israel, Tzur said
they are "close and good relations."
</P>
<P>
Tzur said that Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides plans to visit
Israel next year and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy is
expected to visit Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Tzur said Israeli Minister of Agriculture and Rual Development
Chaim Oron will visit Cyprus on February 15-17, while Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Communications Benjamin Ben-Eliezer will
come to the island probably in May.
</P>

The ambassador further said an Israeli trade delegation will be
visiting Cyprus on February 21-24, describing it as a "very
important visit because they will discuss various fields of
cooperation."

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: Yeltsin to Vacate Kremlin in Mid-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will leave the Kremlin when his second term expires in mid-2000,
his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin said in a newspaper interview due
out Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There still are people who come to the president and ask him,
Boris Nikolayevich, please stay, stay for a third term... But the
president answers them with a firm no," Yakushkin told the
Izvestiya daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"To leave his post at the scheduled time is a matter of honor"
for Yeltsin, the spokesman said. "He has set the rules of the game
and must follow them."
</P>
<P>
It is "solely...the national interests of Russia" that explain
Yeltsin's desire to see Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as the next
president, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Putin was named prime minister last August, when Yeltsin
described him as his preferred successor at the Kremlin. His
rating has skyrocketed in recent months following the launch of
tough military actions against rebels in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday's parliamentary elections, widely seen as a dress
rehearsal for the 2000 presidential race, have also turned out to
be favoring the current ruling establishment.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin denied rumors that Putin "is already governing the
country, while the president is in effect barred from work due to
his health condition."
</P>
<P>
It was also unlikely, Yakushkin said, that Yeltsin would in a
while opt for someone else as his unofficial successor.
</P>
<P>
It was for "serious reasons" that all the previous prime
ministers had been fired in the past couple of years, although"
the true reasons could not always be made public and therefore
caused a heightened curiosity in society," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed four prime ministers in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"The president's steps are undoubtedly based on a well-
considered strategy, which, actually, becomes confirmed by further
developments," Yakushkin said.

ADDIS ABABA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A pilot was killed when a
Su-27 fighter jet of the Ethiopian Air Force crashed early this
month, according to the Press Digest weekly published here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Soon after it caught fire, the report said the Russia-made
aircraft crashed on December 8 at a place about 30 kilometers from
Debre Zeit southeast of Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The fighter was doing a routine flight exercise before it
crashed, the report added.
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to get any official confirmation about
the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that Ethiopia has eight Su-27 aircraft
before the December 8 air crash.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Relief Program Covers Partial Needs of Iraqis: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. humanitarian program
for Iraq, the oil-for-food program, meets only 66 percent of the
real needs of the Iraqi people, said Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammad
Mehdi Salah on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iraq's Satellite Channel television, Salah
confirmed that Iraq has been using its state reserves since the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal three years ago to cover
shortages of the items imported under the humanitarian deal.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Iraq this month used its storage of wheat
to feed its people because the amount under the deal met only one
third of the total need.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that Iraq cannot cover the shortages in dairy
products because it has no enough storage.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ration card system was adopted on August 10, 1990, four
days after the U.N. imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iraq for
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Salah said that the ration card system was designed to prevent
the Iraqi people from starvation by providing them with the minimum
of foodstuffs and other basic daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for delaying the
approval of Iraq's contracts signed under the oil-for-food program,
which allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy humanitarian
supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the endorsement of
its contracts and impeding the implementation of the humanitarian
program.
</P>
<P>
The minister also criticised the U.N. Security Council for not
allowing Iraq to use its frozen assets in foreign countries which
amounted to 4 billion U.S. dollars for humanitarian purposes.

"The Secretary-General views these allegations as a malicious

Kouchner, and commends the extraordinary efforts he has undertaken

demanding conditions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has repeatedly accused Kouchner of taking some
measures, such as the introduction of foreign currencies into the
Serbian province, the opening of the Pristina airport to foreign
airliners and the regulation on bank licensing, in violation of
Security Council resolution 1244, which, adopted on June 10,

<HEADLINE> Syria Serious in Seeking Peace: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Syria was serious in its
pursuit of peace to attain the objectives of the Middle East peace
process, said a senior official of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist
Party here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If Israel is also serious in making peace with its Arab
neighbors, it has to fulfill its obligations on top of which is the
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and south Lebanon, said Abdulla
Ahmar, assistant secretary general of the party, at the 13th
Conference of Arab Agricultural Engineers.
</P>
<P>
Syria has never been an obstacle to peace, said the official, it
made comprehensive and fair peace a strategic option to put an end
to Israeli occupation, restore its territories and establish
security in the region, said Ahmar.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Syria's Golan Heights in the 1967 Mideast war
and annexed it in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel resumed their talks, which were stalled for
almost fours years, in Washington on December 15 and 16 and the two
sides agreed to hold another round of talks on January 3 to tackle
issues such as Israeli withdrawal from the Golan and security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
He also asserted the importance of Arab solidarity and
cooperation to coordinate the Arab economic policies especially in
the field of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the necessity of Arab integration in dealing with
new challenges and risks of globalization and in defending Arab
interests against all forms of power politics and economic blocs.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed issues concerning farm production, the
protection of Arab agriculture, the development of farm production
means and achieving food security in the Arab world.

MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Thursday rejected U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
's accusations that Moscow is using excessive force in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Cohen's remarks that Russia has exceeded the generally accepted
limits of international standards, which might bring about
political and economic consequences for it, are misplaced,
Sergeyev said in Belgrade on an official visit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"First, we do not know what limits we have exceeded in
destroying terrorists, which is being done by both the federal
units and the Chechen people who have liberated all big towns
jointly with federal units without a shot being fired," the
Interfax news agency quoted Sergeyev as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Over 500,000 Chechens are now staying outside Chechnya. Most
of the nearly 30,000 people remaining in Grozny are ethnic
Russians. This is why I do not know what limits Mr. Cohen means, "
Sergeyev said.

<HEADLINE> Crashed Korean Cargo Jet Sends no Mayday Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- British crash investigators
said on Thursday that the Korean Air cargo jet which crashed in a
ball of flames near Stansted airport, north of London, did not
have time to issue a mayday call.
</P>
<P>
Police said there was no prior warning that the jet was in
trouble before the Boeing 747-200 came down in a field near the
airport on Wednesday evening, killing all four crew members.
</P>
<P>
The lack of an emergency broadcast from the plane suggests to
investigators that whatever caused the crash was sudden and
catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
Air accident investigators are picking over the wreckage in a
half-mile wide crater looking for clues to establish why the jet
came down two minutes after its take-off.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Aviation Authority said it ordered inspections of
the Pratt &AMP; Whitney JT9D engines used by the jet last year over
fears that cracks "could lead to uncontained engine failure".
</P>
<P>
However, investigators in the UK said any speculation on the
cause of the accident would be premature.
</P>
<P>
British Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott visited the site of
the crash on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One "black box" flight recorder has been recovered but a second
was still missing.
</P>
<P>
Aviation experts said there have been serious concerns about
Korean Air's safety record. In August 1997, more than 200 people
were killed when one of its Boeing 747s crashed on the Pacific
island of Guam.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people waited overnight at the airport. Many were
bussed to other airports. Flights from Stansted resumed at 1100
GMT.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is dispatching a four-member team to assist with
the crash inquiry, while Korean Air is sending 30 executives and
technicians to the UK.
</P>
<P>
The British government also said on Thursday it had ordered
checks of Korean Airlines  planes earlier this year amid
worries over the airline's safety record but found no reason to
ground its aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just hours after one of the airline's
cargo jumbo jets crashed soon after takeoff from Stansted Airport,
32 km north of London, killing its four crew but causing no
casualties on the ground.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 413 Million Dollars to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved
two projects worth 413.5 million U.S. dollars to help China
improve power system and reduce poverty.
</P>
<P>
Of the 413.5 million dollars, 320 million dollars will be used
to support the Tongbai Pumped Storage Project and 93.5 million
dollars for the poverty-reduction project, according to a World
Bank statement released on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Tongbai Pumped Storage Project will increase peaking
capacity and improve load following capability and power quality
in the Zhejiang and East China power systems. It will also improve
the operating and investment efficiency in generation by
developing and implementing a competitive generation market in
Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
The Project will have a marked impact on the economic
development of the province and, to a lesser extent, the East
China region by mitigating and eliminating institutional and
technical constraints that have prevented the power system from
expanding and operating efficiently, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The poverty-reduction project will help the farmers diversify
their farming systems and sources of income which are now
predominantly from the harvesting of corn and other grains. The
farmers will continue to grow their crops but will also raise 2-3
cattle each to supplement their earnings. Incomes are expected to
rise from their current levels of about 100 dollars per capita per
year to about 200-300 dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
The inland provinces of Henan, Hebei, Anhui, and Shanxi will be
given special attention for this project, the bank said.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Ruslan Aushev, president of the
Russian Ingush republic, on Thursday urged the federal government
to seek a political solution in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen problem cannot be settled militarily. "A political
settlement is the only acceptable option," the Interfax quoted
Aushev as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ingushetia and Chechnya were part of a single republic in
Soviet times. The tiny republic has born the brunt of Chechen
refugees, which totaled over 300,000.
</P>
<P>
Aushev said there are still 25,000 to 30,000 civilians inside
Grozny, the Chechen capital under siege.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to determine the precise number as many people
are hiding from the ongoing artillery bombardment in basements,
Aushev said, adding that many residents also live in separate
houses on the Grozny outskirts.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his criticism of the assaults by federal troops."
Nothing is left of Grozny. The city is being pounded around the
clock. People will return to their city sooner or later. Then what?
Will they ever forget what happened?"

NAIROBI, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nairobi-based U.N.
Environmental Program (UNEP) and U.N. Commission for Human
Settlements (Habitat) are mobilizing a team of experts to help
assess the situation in Venezuela hit by flood.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, it is estimated that up to 50,000 people
have died in floods and landslides in the central American
country. Another 200, 000 people have been left homeless as towns
along the Caribbean coast have been swept away.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of human tragedy caused by natural disasters is
compounded by the unchecked process of urbanization and the
destruction of the environment," said Klaus Toepfer, head of the
UNEP and Habitat. "In fact, evidence shows that the impact of
disasters can be minimized through better environmental and urban
planning."
</P>
<P>
"In a world increasingly beset by natural disasters, there is
an urgent need to establish a vulnerability index to assess which
human settlements are in danger," said Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, studies carried out by UNEP and Habitat of
the major floods in Asia and Latin America show that the
intensity of natural hazards is exacerbated by deforestation,
poor management of water resources and urban planning.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income and Spending Rise in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. personal income picked
up in November while their spending increased a bit faster, the
Commerce Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported that personal income, which includes
wages, interest and government benefits, rose by 0.4 percent last
month. That was the slowest pace since August. In October,
personal income surged by 1.3 percent, the best showing in five
years as federal subsidy payments to farmers and union signing
bonuses in some manufacturing industries boosted income. Those
factors also contributed to income growth in November.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, spending increased by 0.5 percent in November,
following a strong 0.7 percent gain in October.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that the nation's savings rate, savings
as a percentage of after-tax income, was 2.2 percent last month,
down from 2.3 percent in October. The rate hit a record monthly
low of 1.6 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Wages picked up a modest 0.3 percent in November, following a
strong 0.6 percent gain the month before. That was helped out by
sizable signing bonuses from unions. Meanwhile farm proprietors'
income surged by 4.7 percent, reflecting large federal subsidy
payments, which totaled an annualized 24.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending on durable goods, such as washing machines
and cars, increased by 1.3 percent in November, following a slim 0.
1 percent gain the month previous.
</P>
<P>
Spending for nondurable goods, such as food and fuel, rose by 0.
4 percent last month, down from 0.8 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
In another report today, the Labor Department said that the
number of people filing for unemployment benefits last week
increased 14,000 to 281,000. Economists consider claims levels
below 300,000 an indication of a tight labor market, worrying that
could drive up product prices and lead to inflation down the road.

LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Britain's global trade deficit
widened in October, according to official figures released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said Britain's goods trade
deficit with the rest of the world reached 2.26 billion pounds in
October, up from 1.66 billion pounds in September.
</P>
<P>
The widening of the trade deficit gap was due to a 3 percent
fall in the value of exports while imports were up 1 percent, the
ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Britain's trade position has deteriorated in recent years
because of the pound's strength. However, official figures also
showed a third-quarter current account deficit in line with
expectations at 2.88 billion pounds.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Remain Divided Over ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States
failed to gap their differences over the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty in their latest round of arms control talks in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Russian side, in its talks with visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, reaffirmed its basic position
on the ABM treaty, stating that the country rejects all attempts
to undermine this treaty, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
communique Thursday, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day official visit,
held talks with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a top Russian Defense Ministry
official said Thursday that the Russian military were not involved
in any "substantial consultations" with the U.S. on revising the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov, head of the ministry's foreign
military cooperation department, told reporters in Belgrade that
those consultations were of a routine character and did not
address military and technical aspects related to any ABM treaty
revision, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Ivashov was accompanying Russian Defense Ministry Igor Sergeyev
on an official visit to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He was critical of Talbott's statement made in Moscow alleging
that progress in that field had been achieved.
</P>
<P>
"Washington insists an ABM continental system be set up, even
though this is in violation of the 1972 treaty, and we cannot
agree to it. And that is from where one should proceed from," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia continues to insist that the ABM Treaty is the basis for
the entire system of strategic arms reductions, and any attempts
to make amendments to it or back out of it "will destroy the
system and bring about difficult consequences not only for Russia
and the U.S., but the entire world," Ivashov said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis Expecting China-U.S. Trade Accord to Lift Global Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The trade accord between
China and the United States and the prospect of China's accession
to the World Trade Organization will likely lift global growth and
accelerate the pace of domestic investment in China, according to
an analysis released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the growth rate in China was projected to be 8 percent and
that of Asia 6.7 percent before the trade agreement, these rates
are likely to increase to 10 percent and 7 percent respectively,
said the analysis by the Conference Board, a U.S. business
membership and research organization with a worldwide network
linking some 3,000 companies in 67 countries. "This upward
revision is based on an anticipated acceleration in the Chinese
investment growth rate to 12 percent -- a rate roughly equal to
the post-1989 average, but well below the growth rates of the mid-
1990s," the Conference Board said.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence, the research organization said, global growth
will edge up to 3.6 percent, with higher rates in the second half
of 2000 than at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
But the Conference Board quoted its vice president and chief
economist Gail D. Foster as saying that faster than expected
growth in China and Asia next year could lead to more inflation
and interest pressures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports and manufacturing will both benefit from a
stronger Asian manufacturing sector, said the Conference Board,
adding that this improvement is, however, unlikely to raise the
overall U.S. growth, still projected to be 3.7 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The research organization explained that given the underlying
strength in the U.S. economy, any further stimulus to growth is
likely to pull in as many imports as it generates added exports.
Also, developing Asia (including China) accounts for only 19
percent of U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
Emerging market growth in Asia will generally be constrained by
a shortage of foreign investment, the Conference Board said. This
shortfall is particularly critical for the crisis countries of
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand,
which are already projected to suffer a net outflow of foreign
investment. Meanwhile, the U.S.- China trade deal and Chinese
accession to the WTO are likely to make China an even greater
magnet for foreign investment -- particularly foreign direct
investment, the Conference Board said. Because foreign direct
investment is closely tied to the pace of investment in the Asian
economy, the benefits that many Asian economies are likely to
enjoy from a more dynamic China will be offset by shortages in
foreign investment that will limit domestic investment and growth
in the near future.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prosecutors Say Woman Arrested Has Terrorist Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The disclosure came as prosecutors argued successfully in
federal court to keep Lucia Garofalo and Bouabide Chamchi in jail.
Both were arrested Sunday at a remote border crossing in
northeastern Vermont State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said in court documents that they have linked Ms.
Garofalo's cell phone and the car she was driving to Brahim Mahdi,
a member of the Algerian Islamic League, whose leader is said to
be connected to "organizations sponsoring a number of terrorist
acts in Europe and Algeria."
</P>
<P>
The arrests of Lucia Garofalo and Bouabide Chamchi, combined
with the arrest of an Algerian man in Washington State last week
on bomb-related charges, have stirred fears of terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
arrested an American in New Jersey State and charged him with
threatening to leave a van filled with explosives in a tunnel
leading to New York City.
</P>
<P>
As the year 2000 approaches, the U.S. State Department asked
American citizens abroad to be cautious over the holiday weekend
because of possible terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. officials are issuing reminders to be on the
lookout for warning signs of terrorist attack, especially in large
crowds in the country.

<HEADLINE> Sudan, Egypt to Normalize Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Sudan have agreed to
normalize bilateral ties based on the settlement of the Halaib
border dispute and Egypt would send back its ambassador to Khartoum
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Khartoum airport Thursday from a trip to
Egypt, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir said that during his talks
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo Wednesday, they
agreed to fully normalize bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
While describing his talks with Egyptian leaders as "serious",
al-Bashir said that the talks had produced fruitful results for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir said he and Mubarak also agreed on the gradual freeing
of individual and goods movement between the two countries, a move
which is expected to pave the way for the initiation of a common
market as part of the Arab common market and the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Egypt had accused Sudan of orchestrating an attempt on Mubarak's
life in Ethiopia in June, 1995 and lowered its relations with Sudan
to the level of working contacts. It also accused Sudan of backing
the rebellion by Islamic radicals in Egypt, a charge denied by
Sudan repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors have also been disputing over the potentially
mineral-rich Halaib, a 17,000-square-kilometer area near the Red
Sea.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders reasserted support for the
efforts to establish a fair, permanent and comprehensive peace in
the Middle East under relevant U.N. resolutions and the land-for-
peace principle.
</P>
<P>
He denied having met with any Sudanese opposition figures in
Cairo. However, he said his government was ready to hold a meeting
on national reconciliation in Cairo or elsewhere at any time.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak discussed the latest developments in Sudan during his
recent trips to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates and Libya.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bashir last week declared a three-month state of emergency
and dissolved parliament believed to result from a row with former
Parliament Speaker Hassan al Turabi.

<HEADLINE> No Further Bank Bailouts in Future: Turkish Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government on
Thursday ruled out any further bailouts in the country's fragile
banking system following the takeovers of five ailing private
banks.
</P>
<P>
Recep Onal, the state minister for economy, told a news
conference that no more bank bailouts would emerge in the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"We have done whatever was necessary to clean the system and are
fully confident that no such move would take place until, of
course, an extraordinary event occurs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Onal argued that the timing of latest seizing of the banks was
perfect because the government concluded that takeover was the only
remedy to recover them.
</P>
<P>
"We made the move when we had enough evidence and data to tell
us that we had to act," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Central Bank Governor Gazi Ercel told reporters that
there is no need to worry about further bank failures. He said "
even the strongest bank could collapse if the public considers it
weak, and there are rumors to that effect."
</P>
<P>
The cost to the government of the seizure would be minimal,
particularly when compared with bank failures in Asia, the governor
added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Foreign Direct Investment to Keep Rising in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Inflows of private foreign
direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh have risen to nearly 400
million U.S. dollars in fiscal 1997-1998, up from a trickle in the
1980s, and are expected to average about 780 million dollars a
year for the next five years, according to a new study released by
the World Bank Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study, Foreign Direct Investment in Bangladesh: Issues of
Long-Run Sustainability, said that trade and exchange
liberalization, current account convertibility, and liberalization
of the investment regime have all helped to bring this increase
about.
</P>
<P>
Given the lack of consolidated data on the amount of FDI in
Bangladesh, the study attempted to provide a credible magnitude of
the inflows and outflows and projected the implications for
balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, FDI inflows are projected to average
about 900 million dollars annually from 2000-2010, as compared to
620 million dollars annually during 1992-2000. Outflows in this
case would rise, on an annual basis, from mere 129 million dollars
during 1996-2000, to almost 600 million dollars during 2001-2005,
and 1.2 billion dollars during 2006-2000.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector has been the principal recipient of the
inflows but, if current trends continue, foreign investment in
telecommunication, manufacturing and services could overtake
energy by 2006, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The study found that Bangladesh has experienced a more stable
form of capital inflow, with FDI making up about 85-90 percent of
the total inflows so far. Both FDI and private inflows in
Bangladesh have largely financed imports of machinery and
equipment, a sign that Bangladesh is only in the preliminary phase
of FDI flows.
</P>
<P>
FDI and debt inflows have not helped Bangladesh in augmenting
foreign exchange reserves so far and are not expected to do so
over the next 10 years. In fact, as inflows grow, so do outflows
in the medium to long term.
</P>
<P>
To cover profit repatriation, interest payment, and
amortization of private debt, while enjoying the benefits of
substantial FDI, Bangladesh needs to augment its debt-servicing
capacity through sustained growth in exports, the study said.

agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts from Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, Syria,
Iraq, Palestine, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, Morocco and Yemen
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Workers Protest Against IMF Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 civil servants
took to the streets here Thursday to protest against the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its pressure on the Turkish
government to limit pay rises in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The workers marched into Kizilay Square in the heart of the
capital, only hours after the IMF's managing board in Washington
agreed to fulfil a 4-billion-dollar standby accord with the Turkish
government.
</P>
<P>
The rally was the first demonstration of public anger at an IMF-
sponsored disinflation program whose contents were disclosed last
month.
</P>
<P>
In return for the IMF loan, the government pledged, among other
things, to cut public expenditure, which it hopes to help lower
inflation to single-digit level by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Riot police backed by armored cars set up barricades to prevent
the protesters, who gathered from three directions, from
approaching the center of the square.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators chanted slogans saying that "the IMF's hand in
Turkish workers' pockets" and "we shall resist and overcome."
</P>
<P>
The police warned the protesters to disperse, but the crowds
kept their ground with a banner reading "get out IMF, this is our
country."
</P>
<P>
The civil servants are angry at a projected 15 percent pay raise
for the first half of 2000, which runs far short of their
expectations. The unions want a collective bargaining agreement
with the IMF and substantial wage increases in line with inflation,
now some 60 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Under the impact of big earthquakes and other unfavorable
factors, Turkey's gross national product in 1999 is expected to
record a negative number, unprecedented in recent years.

MANAGUA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American
States (OAS) announced Thursday it will maintain next year its
support for the retirement of antipersonnel land mines buried in
Nicaragua during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
"Front No. 5" for the withdrawal of mines in the Atlantic zone
of Nicaragua will be opened in the first months of 2000, said OAS
official Sergio Carmagna.
</P>
<P>
More than 55,000 mines have been destroyed and 82,233 continue
buried, according to the Nicaraguan army.
</P>
<P>
Carmagna said that the OAS keeps close coordination with the
army and takes part in the administration of the funds provided
from abroad for the retirement of the explosive devises.
</P>
<P>
The OAS support to the de-mining task is based on the role
played by the Nicaraguan army sappers, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Some 136,800 land mines are kept in armed forces warehouses,
according to military authorities.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Launch Satellite Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has
concluded its plan to launch a satellite tagged Nigeria Sat One
next year at a cost of 5. 5 billion naria (5.5 million U.S.
dollars), the Guardian newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Federal Executive Council at its meeting of October 13,
1999, approved that Nigeria should launch her own satellite
(Nigeria Sat 1) starting from the year 2000," Science and
Technology Minister Ebitimi Banigo was quoted as saying by the
paper at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The minister explained that 15 percent of the cost would be
contributed by the Federal Government while the remaining 85
percent would be from the private sector, especially banks and oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
The project was necessitated by its innumerable benefits, one
of which is the potential to rapidly integrate rural dwellers with
their urban counterparts through communication effectiveness, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With the satellite, he said that "Nigeria would be able to
increase its tele-density at a low cost. Telephone lines would be
extended to rural and remote areas by cost effective wireless
satellite communication and the cost of local and international
calls would be significantly reduced."
</P>
<P>
In the areas of national security and border surveillance, the
system would enhance genuine sophistication in Nigeria's
intelligence and counter intelligence activities, especially in
theft recovery, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Netherlands: 1999 Good Year for National Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch economy has had a
good year in 1999, with an estimated 3.5 percent growth, despite a
sluggish recovery in the European Union as a whole, the Dutch
government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 percent growth would be only slightly lower than those
achieved in the preceding two years, the government said in a news
release.
</P>
<P>
The biggest rise of 4.1 percent in the decade occurred in 1990.
Compared with the last period of rapid economic growth in 1989 and
1990, growth is now more durable and stable. "It has been above 3
percent for more than three and a half years," the government
added.
</P>
<P>
The increase in percentage in imports and exports of goods and
services are lower than the rises in previous years. While the
rate of increase in investment is of the same magnitude as in 1998
and 1997. Consumer spending has also remained at a high level in
1999.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the output of manufactured goods hass
recovered and the rise in October was the highest since August
1998. The 2.2 percent inflation in November was the same as the
average for the first eleven months of the year, while registered
unemployment continues to drop, reaching the lowest level since
the mid-1980s, the government said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Export Turnover Up 23 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The export growth rate trebled the yearly target despite
difficulties, including the declining prices of many farm products,
according to Vietnam's General Statistics Office.
</P>
<P>
Some major export items of the country have achieved record
growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil tops the list with more than 14.7 million tons sold
abroad, making a year-on-year rise of 62 percent or an earn of 2
billion U.S. dollars, followed by rice with 4.55 million tons
worth over one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other prominent exports include garments (1.68 billion dollars)
footwear (1.4 billion dollars), sea products (one billion dollars),
coffee (600 million dollars), fine art handicrafts (165 million
dollars) and electronics and computers (590 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The growth is attributed to Vietnamese businesses' efforts and
the Vietnamese government's open policies regarding the management
of exports, said VNA.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam's Ministry of Trade said that the export
growth is not stable because earnings from the export of raw
materials, semi-processed and sub-contracted products accounted
for a large proportion of the country's total export turnover.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese goods' competitiveness in the world market is low
and their prices still depend on the fluctuation of world prices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, exporters' dependence on the Asian market is another
reason for the instability of exports.

<HEADLINE> China to Dismiss Unqualified Policemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua ) -- China's police chief has
vowed to dismiss unqualified policemen in a bid to curb corruption,
malpractice, and other misbehavior among the country's law
enforcers.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 policemen who failed a national quality
examination and have been suspended from their posts are now
preparing for a makeup exam. "If they fail again, they will be
fired," said Jia Chunwang, minister of public security.
</P>
<P>
About 930,000 cops of the 1.5-million-strong police force have
passed the examination which was introduced last year.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the immediate measures Chinese police officers
have taken to improve the overall quality and the image of the
policemen, an image that has been somewhat tarnished by offenders
in recent years, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, the country's top legislature, Jia admitted that some
problems inside the police "have turned serious and aroused lots
of complaints from the public."
</P>
<P>
The abuse of power, bribery, inquisition by torture, and some
police officers' unconcern and even crude attitude toward those
who ask their help have all been widely criticized, he
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to tackle the problems and greatly improve the
image of the police in the next three years," Jia said while
reporting to the lawmakers on the work of police departments.
</P>
<P>
In fact, about 11,000 police offenders were punished last year,
among whom 1,380 were found to be criminally responsible and 2,272
were fired.
</P>
<P>
As a result of nationwide investigations of police corruption,
the number of disclosed cases dropped significantly in the first
half of this year, compared with the same period last year, Jia
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also affirmed police contributions to stability of
the society, saying that more than 5,000 policemen have died in
the line of duty and some 100,000 were injured in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry plans to improve the national
systems of examination and appraisal for police officers, which
will help form a competitive mechanism for a better quality of the
police.
</P>
<P>
More effective systems of supervision will also be introduced
to plug loopholes which often lead to corruption, Jia added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Plant Greater Variety of Autumn-Winter Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's farmers planted 46.67
million hectares of crops in this year's autumn and winter season,
roughly the same as last year, but fewer staple crops and a
greater variety of vegetables, the Ministry of Agriculture said
today.
</P>
<P>
The total acreage includes 23.67 million hectares of winter
wheat, 1.8 million hectares less than last year, according to a
recent survey of 600 counties nationwide carried out by the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the country's restructuring plan for planting and the
influence of market prices, the farmers planted 7.1 million
hectares of rapeseed, an increase of 12 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The area for vegetables is estimated at 6.4 million hectares,
up 9.3 percent; that for succulence at 800,000 hectares, the same
as last year; and that for green plants to be used as fertilizer
at 2.27 million hectares, up 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has experienced good summer harvests in recent years,
resulting in lower prices for wheat in the current crop market.
The major farming provinces including Shandong and Jiangsu have
taken measures to reduce the planting area of wheat and increase
that of rapeseed and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a good harvest next summer, experts with the ministry
have urged farmers to implement timely winter irrigation and
fertilization projects according to temperature changes and the
growth of seedlings.

long run will depend on the country's exploitation in the North

<HEADLINE> China to Popularize Compulsory Education in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to
popularize nine-year compulsory education in areas with 85 percent
of its total population next year, with primary school education
available in the remaining areas, said Peng Peiyun, vice-
chairwoman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, here today.
</P>
<P>
Up until last year, 2,242 of China's 2,862 counties had been
assessed as qualified in their work to popularize nine-year
compulsory education, covering a 73 percent of the total
population, Peng told the ongoing the 13th session of the 9th NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Since the "Compulsory Education Law" was initiated in 1986,
China has made great achievements in popularizing compulsory
education, which is reflected in increased education funds, and
improved school facilities and quality of teachers, she said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that the Chinese government spent more than
150 billion yuan on compulsory education in 1998, an 18-fold
increase compared with 1986. As a result, the country's total area
of dilapidated classroom buildings has reduced by a big margin,
from accounting for 17 percent of the total in 1986 to two percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
The average salary of primary and high school teachers also
increase to 7,440 yuan last year from 1,345 yuan in 1986, along
with improvement in their housing.
</P>
<P>
However, China still faces numerous challenges in implementing
nine-year compulsory education, Peng said, adding that some local
governments still pay little attention to promoting education.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee has suggested the State Council and
educational departments to draft out a long-term plan for
popularizing compulsory education nationwide up to the year 2010.

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has named Reserve-General Menachem Einan as head of a
steering committee for preparing talks with Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Einan once served as Israeli Defense Forces' planing chief and
led the military delegation in the previous peace talks with
Lebanon in 1993, the report quoted a statement issued by Barak's
office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the steering committee will be government
coordinator in Lebanon Uri Lubrani, Barak's senior security adviser
Danny Yatom and Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, who was the
most veteran Israeli at peace talks with the Arabs and participated
in the Camp David negotiations as a foreign ministry lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Following the recent resumption of negotiations between Israel
and Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon, the Israeli-Lebanese
peace talks are expected to be renewed in the near future after a
45-month-long suspension.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara, who met Barak in
Washington last week, said on Monday that the talks on the Lebanese
track could resume soon after the second Israeli-Syrian round on
January 3.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel
Murrhas disclosed earlier that he will head Lebanon's team for
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a self-declared security zone in South
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Lebanon has been demanding an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from its territory.

LONDON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- London's Stansted Airport,
which experienced the crash of a Korean Airlines cargo jet on
Wednesday, has resumed its normal services on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Flights are now back on time. We are expecting around 17,000
people to leave the airport today," a spokesman from the airport
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have now got the airport back to working normally," he said.
</P>
<P>
The airport is slowly returning to normal after more than a day
of delays and rearranged flights for thousands of passengers as a
result of the crash.
</P>
<P>
Many flights had been delayed around four hours overnight. A
backlog of thousands of waiting passengers had now been cleared.
</P>
<P>
The runway was cleared and re-opened on Thursday and everything
had been back to normal for passengers on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crash investigators discovered that the crew on the
stricken plane did not have time to issue a mayday call before it
came down.
</P>
<P>
But it is thought that, as the plane was pointing back towards
Stansted when it crashed, the crew were desperately trying to make
it back to the airport.
</P>
<P>
The KAL Boeing 747-200 came down in a field near a motorway
shortly after take-off at Stansted on Wednesday evening and burst
into a tower of flames. Its four crew members died.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Says Not to Put Pressure on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said Thursday that he will not put any pressure on the
Supreme Court to validate the presidential and parliamentary
elections on December 3-5.
</P>
<P>
"I have never interfered in the proceedings of any court, at
any level," the Mozambique News Agency Friday quoted the president
as saying. He pledged that he does not intend to start doing so
now.
</P>
<P>
Chissano and his ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Party
(Frelimo) won the elections, but the main opposition Mozambican
National Resistance (Renamo) submitted an appeal to the Supreme
Court Thursday calling for a recount.
</P>
<P>
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama warned at a press conference
Wednesday that if Chissano were to "put pressure on the Supreme
Court to validate these results, Mozambique will become
ungovernable."
</P>
<P>
"The Mozambican people have sworn that there shall be no more
confusion in the country", he noted. "They would never make the
country ungovernable" .
</P>
<P>
Friday's Noticias newspaper quoted Chissano as saying that
"making the country ungovernable would mean paralyzing economic
and social development efforts."
</P>
<P>
Chissano pointed out that Renamo and its coalition allies have
seats in parliament "where they can make their voices heard, and
through this, can influence the march of history".
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the Supreme Court's deliberations might hold
up the swearing into office of the new parliament, and of himself
for another five- year term.
</P>
<P>
Renamo might well boycott the new parliament, but that would
not stop it from functioning since Frelimo has a majority in the
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Frelimo would take its seats and start
working "because the country must not grind to a halt".

</P>
<P>
The whereabouts of the hijacked flight, IC-814, were not

</P>
<P>
A PTI correspondent reported from Islamabad that the Pakistani
authorities refused to allow the hijacked plane to land at the
Lahore airport Friday evening.

Delhi, PTI said.
</P>
<P>

airport told PTI over telephone that the hijackers asked for "
permission to land but we have refused."
</P>
<P>
Another official at the Lahore airport said the plane was still
in Indian airspace.
</P>
<P>
However, the identity of the hijackers, said to be armed, or
their number could not be ascertained immediately.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Indian Airlines said that the airport
authorities have put major airports near the Pakistan border at
Chandigarh, Jammu and Amritsar on alert following the hijack.
</P>

Civil, police and other airport authorities have been directed
to keep emergency arrangements in preparedness, PTI said.

preparations for such services as internet and E-mail are at the
final stage, said a government statement here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The services are to be extended by the state-run Myanma Posts

<P>
The country started providing X-100 E-mail service in 1997 and
since then there has been at least 3,000 lines of the CDMA mobile
telephone system reportedly in operation in the country in
addition to 225,164 auto-telephone lines.

<P>
NEW DELHI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Equities suffered a sharp
setback on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Friday, bringing the
Sensive Index (Sensex) down by 94 points in the wake of all-round
selling from operators and lack of follow-up support from

The BSE Sensex opened on a promising note at 4,982.72 points

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Prompts Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- China's export this year is
expected to increase by five percent, or 9.2 billion U.S. dollars,
from last year, a senior trade official said today.
</P>
<P>
The projected export growth means an increase of nearly 80
billion yuan in China's gross domestic product and a creation of 1.
1 million job opportunities, said Sun Zhenyu, deputy minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the value of export products delivered by
industrial enterprises nationwide in the January-November period
shot up 13.7 percent from a year earlier, 4.7 percentage points
higher than the growth rate for the nation's industrial output
value during the same period.
</P>
<P>
This has given a strong impetus to the country's industrial
production, Sun said at a national conference on foreign trade and
economic cooperation, which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
The amount of foreign capital flowing into China this year is
estimated at 38 billion U.S. dollars, worth a total investment of
more than 314 billion yuan, he said, adding that the role of
foreign capital to help China's economic growth could never be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the expansion in foreign trade and overseas
investment has directly led to an increase in tax incomes, citing
the latest statistics, which show that China's income from export
and import duties for the first 11 months this year amounted to
142 billion yuan, up nearly 90 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export and foreign capital influx also has
contributed to the growth in China's foreign exchange reserve,
which stood at 153.77 billion U.S. dollars by the end of November,
8.81 billion U.S. dollars more than the figure at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said the major task in promoting foreign
trade next year will remain to be focusing on increasing exports,
and attracting more overseas investment, with the export growth
rate kept not lower than this year's level.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also needed to attract more foreign capital next
year than this year and to promote the development of foreign
contracted projects, labor service cooperation as well as Chinese-
invested projects abroad.
</P>
<P>
Sun pointed out that China will continue to crackdown on all
illegal activities in the field of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, especially those related to taxes and foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to launch severe penalty measures on criminals and
companies in strict accordance with the law, saying that
enterprises engaged in such illegal activities will have their
import and export autonomy revoked.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian cabinet on Friday
delayed the approval of the draft law on the trial of former Khmer
Rouge leaders in order to continue consultations with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
After nearly five hours debate, the Council of Ministers made
some amendments to the draft law which was scheduled to be
approved Friday and decided to have another debate on January 6,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Sok An, a member of the Council of Ministers, said after the
meeting that the amendments were made in accordance with the
proposal of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. The revised draft
law will then be sent to the U.N. for comments.
</P>
<P>
The draft law contains provisions for the establishment of
Extraordinary Formations of Phnom Penh courts and covers
atrocities committed by former Khmer Rouge leaders between April
17, 1975 and January 6, 1979.
</P>
<P>
The accused will be charged with serious violations of
Cambodian criminal laws and international laws on genocide, crimes
against humanity, destruction of cultural property and crimes
against internationally protected persons.
</P>
<P>
Sok An reiterated the three principles Cambodia insists on in
the Khmer Rouge trial: to give justice to the victims, to maintain
peace and stability of the country and to respect the sovereignty
of the Royal Government of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government rejected an international tribunal for
trying the Khmer Rouge leaders and insisted on preserving the
country's sovereignty over the process.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Govt Rams Through New Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
will raise an extra 465 million NZ dollars (240 million U.S.
dollars) a year after the newly adopted Tax Rate Increase Bill
takes effect on April 1, 2000, the New Zealand Press Association
reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which was passed by a majority in the
Parliament Thursday night after a 12-hour fierce debate, the
taxation rate on anyone earning more than 60,000 NZ dollars (31,
200 U.S. dollars) a year will rise to 39 percent from 33 percent
as of April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Michael Cullen was quoted as saying that his
Labor Party had promised a tax rise during the election campaign
in order to pay for more social services.
</P>
<P>
The first priorities are to restore superannuation to 65
percent of the average wage from the current 60 percent and reduce
the burden of student loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the National Party and ACT NZ, the two major opposition
parties in the Parliament, said that the bill will punish skilled
people who want to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 7.2 percent of taxpayers or 203,000 people
will face a tax increase next year.

<HEADLINE> US Accused of Launching Propaganda War Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
Friday accused the United States of launching a propaganda war
against the militia on the plea of combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Talking to local media here, Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan
Maulvi Syeyd Haqqani said U.S.'s alleged apprehensions about
possible terrorist activities by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi national
wanted by Washington, are "totally baseless."
</P>
<P>
He said the American government wants to mislead the world
through a propaganda war against the "Afghan Islamic Emirate."
</P>
<P>
"Washington wants to hide its defective policies," he said. "We
hope that the U.S. citizens will not be misled by the American
government's propaganda campaign," he added.
</P>
<P>
The envoy regretted that the U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley has doubted the Taliban announcement that they have
withdrawn all communication facilities to Osama.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. did not accept our plea that Osama cannot use Afghan
soil against anyone. The U.S. official is giving out of context
exaggerated reports that Osama is planning attacks on Americans on
the eve of new year celebrations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said the Taliban will still stand by their stance that
Osama is a guest in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Afghanistan is against terrorism, the envoy said
"we are satisfied that Osama is not involved in terrorist
activities."

<HEADLINE> Slow Population Growth To Continue in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The major task for family
planning work in China in the future will be to sustain a slow
population growth and solve other population problems, said State
Councilor Wang Zhongyu at a national conference on family planning.
</P>
<P>
The number of women of childbearing age, the elderly and
farmers that come to urban centers to find work will continue to
increase in the next decade. These factors will cause serious
population problems.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged family planning committees at all levels to be aware
of the importance as well as the difficulties of sustaining a slow
population growth.
</P>
<P>
A macro-control and management system of family planning needs
to be established to encourage people to follow family planning
policies and develop social welfare systems. Wang said that the
government should use tax breaks, price control and other methods
to improve family planning work in central and western areas and
disaster-stricken areas with financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that population and family planning work in
central and western China should be made a priority and be
combined with poverty-relief work in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge of the State Family Planning
Commission, made a speech on population and family planning work
for next year at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Steps up Efforts to Cope With Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- As the year 2000 is drawing
near, Turkey has intensified its preparations to ward off chaos
which might be incurred by the Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
Banks and brokerage houses have invested millions of dollars to
become Y2K compliant. But it is still unclear, only days before the
new millenium, if the country's private and government computer and
information systems are well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
A study by the key planning agency, the State Planning
Organization (DPT), puts Turkey's average compliance rate at 92
percent as of December 10.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, Turkey's most compliant official sectors
are finance and defense, which are 99 percent to 99.9 percent Y2K
compliant.
</P>
<P>
The least compliant sectors are health and energy, with 78.5
percent and 86 percent respectively. So the Turks are worrying
about the danger of untimely hospital casualties and darkness at
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Most of Turkey's power supplies in urban areas come from a new
generation of combined-cycle and gas-fired power stations.
</P>
<P>
Recent interruptions in gas flows from Russia, Turkey's main
supplier, left Ankara, the capital, and Istanbul, the largest city
of the country, in darkness and cold.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia said interruptions in its gas supplies in the
new year were out of the question, Turkey's national pipeline
company, Botas, is also waiting assurances from other gas sources:
Algeria, Nigeria and countries on the route of an import pipeline
of Russian gas, including Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania and Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Botas, which, in addition to gas pipelines, also administers two
oil pipelines that stretch from the Kirkuk oil fields in northern
Iraq to Turkey's Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, is only 86.5 percent
compliant.
</P>
<P>
The DPT study said that the Energy Ministry is fully Y2K
compliant. But people suspect that the reference to the Energy
Ministry is the headquarters systems only.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, electricity production or the national
power company, TEAS, is 93 percent ready.
</P>
<P>
The State Water Works declared that it is already 96.5 percent
compliant which may considerably relieve people's concern about the
safety of dam and hydroelectric power stations.
</P>
<P>
The maritime authorities announced in a statement on Tuesday
that the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits will be closed to
vessels longer than 200 meters for 15 hours from 1400 GMT on
December 31 to minimize potential Y2K risks.
</P>
<P>
Y2K, or the millenium bug, are likely to strike older computers
coding that signified dates only with the last two digits.
Therefore, some computers might take the year 2000 for 1900,
causing malfunction or crash.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Approves Record Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet Friday
approved a record high 84.99 trillion yen (828.3 billion U.S.
dollars) draft budget for fiscal 2000 as the final injection of
fiscal stimulus for an economy recovery.
</P>
<P>
It is the biggest budget proposal in Japan's history and marks
a 3.8 percent increase over the initial budget for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
The draft general-account budget for the year starting next
April 1 features a 2.6 percent expansion in general expenditures
to a record 48,091.4 billion yen (468.7 billion dollars) to fund
public works spending, the second straight year of growth in the
policy-oriented portion of budgetary outlays.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is scheduled to introduce the budget
for approval to an ordinary Diet (parliament) session in January.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget proposal, Japan's social welfare expenditures
will increase by 4.1 percent over the current fiscal year budget.
</P>
<P>
The defense budget is to be raised 0.1 percent for the first
upturn in three fiscal years, while official development
assistance (ODA), as Japan's foreign aid is called, will fall 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
To avoid placing a tax burden on the people, the budget will be
financed largely by the issuance of 23.46 trillion yen (228.6
billion dollars) bonds to cover the deficits.
</P>
<P>
Total bonds of 32.6 trillion yen (317.7 billion dollars), which
also include bonds to finance public works projects, is the
largest amount ever planned for a budget.
</P>
<P>
The bonds issued for the budget will push the total amount of
outstanding government bonds at the end of fiscal 2000 to 364
trillion yen (3547.7 billion dollars), and Japan's long-term
government debt is expected to hit 645 trillion yen (6286.5
billion dollars), or about 1.3 times the country's gross domestic
product (GDP).

<P>
JERUSALEM, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A briefcase bomb exploded at
the central bus station in Israel's northern coastal town of
Netanya, Israel Radio reported Friday, adding that no one was
injured,
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at about 8:00 a.m. local time (0600 GMT)
Friday morning when policemen were trying to detonate the exploder.
An alert shopkeeper called to police after he found the suspicious
dark-blue briefcase left on the ground near his shop.
</P>
<P>
The police immediately evacuated the area completely.
</P>
<P>
Nobody has claimed responsibility for the explosion. Some
suspects have been detained for interrogation and the police blamed
the blast on a group of Arab militants who are against the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb explosion injured 27 people in Netanya on November
7, just one day before the final-status negotiation between Israel
and the Palestinians was officially launched.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear whether there are any links between the two
explosions.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Ensure High Quality of Generic Medicines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
focusing on ensuring the high quality of generic drugs as well as
studying the possibility of facilitating their distribution to
small drugstores.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez said in a radio speech that
this is in line with President Joseph Estrada's order to make
medicines more affordable to the Filipino people.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is to ensure quality. All other
problems about the pricing of medicines hinge on this," Romualdez
said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the questionable quality of some generic
medicines in the past was what made the medical community
skeptical of prescribing these lower-priced drugs.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said the government has already taken a major step in
ensuring the high quality of medicines by adopting stricter
screening measures for generic drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring quality is the primary aim now. Low prices will
follow. We need first to regain the public's confidence in generic
medicines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Once generic medicines gain public acceptance, he added, only
then can the Health Department pit them strongly against branded
drugs.
</P>
<P>
This way, he said, competition would force big pharmaceutical
firms to also bring down their prices.

<HEADLINE> British Police Warn of Millennium Mail Bomb Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- British police warned Friday
that the British people should be wary of unexpected or suspicious-
looking parcels in the run-up to Christmas and millennium
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"There may be groups or individuals who may try to disrupt the
celebrations and people should be on their guard against any
suspect packages or anyone acting suspiciously," said Alan Fry,
deputy assistant commissioner of London's Metropolitan police
force.
</P>
<P>
The warning was revealed amid fears that Islamic militants may
have posted parcel bombs to Britain.
</P>
<P>
"Recent arrests in Jordan and the U.S.A. have heightened the
public's awareness of a possible threat from Islamic extremist
groups," Fry said.
</P>
<P>
"The public are our eyes and ears and we would encourage them
in the run-up to Christmas and the millennium to be vigilant and
to contact police if they notice anything suspicious," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
said it had "unsubstantiated information" that extremists "may be
planning to send bombs in small parcels" to the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The FBI told the public to be cautious with parcels "
originating from or bearing Frankfurt, Germany, postal markings or
stamps when the sender is unknown or unfamiliar to the recipient."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are more
optimistic about the country's future economic situation, but lack
confidence that their incomes will increase.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indices for November released today by the National
Bureau of Statistics indicate that 65 percent of consumers believe
that the economy will improve in the next 12 months, 2 percentage
points higher than in October.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of consumers anticipate that China's economy will
maintain stable growth in the next five years, a rise of 2
percentage points from October.
</P>
<P>
However, more consumers predict that their income will remain
unchanged in the next 12 months, with only 36 percent of consumers
expecting higher incomes, dropping 2 percentage points from
October.
</P>
<P>
A survey on 4,200 consumers in cities across China shows that
what constitutes a "good family life" in the new millennium will
include spacious housing, high incomes, healthy and talented
offspring and a harmonious family.

autocracy and the beginning of a new chapter in the history of the
biggest country in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been ruled by military dictators for the past 30
years. It was faced with a strong political and economic reform
movement triggered by the 1997 monetary crisis in Asian countries.
On May 21, 1998, former president Soeharto had no choice but to
step down amid a serious political crisis. Since then, people have
been dreaming of a new Indonesia, totally different from the past.
But the followers of the former regime tried to keep their vested
interests by creating social unrest everywhere, pushing the
country into a long-drawn-out political turbulence and a grave
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
However, a radical political and economic reformation had
become the trend of the times and the desire of the people. Under
the pressure of the democratic movement, Soeharto's successor, B.J.
Habibie, had to advance the parliamentary election from 2003 to
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The first multi-party election in 40 years resulted in a new
political pattern dominated by reformist groups. In October, the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest
legislative body, elected leaders of reformist parties and well-
known personages as the country's president, vice president as
well as legislative leaders. The MPR also deliberated and amended
a series of laws including the 1945 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion spoke highly of these important events in
Indonesia, saying they were showing an inexorable trend of the
times characterized by peace, democracy and development. These
developments not only were in the interests of the vast majority
of the Indonesian people, but also were beneficial to the
stability, progress and development in the region.
</P>
<P>
As the world is entering the new millennium, the new government
of Indonesia led by President Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri are bringing fresh hope and opportunities
to the archipelago country by launching a series of reforms.
Observers here pointed out that the hope of success for the new
government lies in the strong support and hearty trust from the
majority of the people.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after being sworn in, Wahid's Cabinet of National
Unity decided to conduct a wide-ranging national reconciliation
policy without racial or religious discrimination. With the
purpose to enhance the people's welfare and justice, the policy is
regarded as a brilliant move to put the country on the right track
to achieve social stability and economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Wahid's determination to establish a clean and efficient
government by upholding and strengthening the legal system, as
well as eradicating corruption and degeneration is appreciated by
the people of all walks of life and the international community.
</P>
<P>
By vowing to transform the country into a modern nation in the
rapidly approaching new millennium without negating Indonesia's
active role in fostering international cooperation based on mutual
respect and understanding, President Wahid had toured dozens of
countries including China, the United States and Japan. The
initiative has rehabilitated Indonesia's reputation
internationally and helped the country to obtain broad political
and economic support.
</P>
<P>
The new government has brought a relative stable political
condition in the country making it possible for its rich human and
natural resources potential to be fully utilized for the
prosperity of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, it is obvious that the new Indonesian government is
faced with severe challenges as the country is still suffering
from the staggering crisis at a critical period of transition from
the old system to a new one.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the struggle between the reformists and conservatives
is continuing, which can from time to time lead to unrest in the
society and disturb the ongoing reform process. So, some political
analysts hold that the political transition in Indonesia has a
long and arduous way to go.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the government has to take right and wise measures to
deal with the racial problem. The break down of the Soeharto
regime has been followed by the sudden rise of demands from
several regions, ranging from the clamor for more autonomy to that
for independence. President Wahid admitted that disintegration of
the unitary state of Indonesia is one of the main problems that
the country has been dealing with.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, economic recovery should be the new government's top
priority. Although Indonesia's economy is showing signs of
recovery and is expected to post a positive growth in 2000, there
are many knotty problems that must be resolved as soon as possible,
especially its banking sector with huge bad debts. The heavy
foreign debts of the government and private companies are also a
constraint for the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Another urgent task to be taken up seriously by the new
government is the eradication of the corruption which was rampant
under the former regime. But the problem is not so easy to resolve
as it has been rooted on all levels of the society.
</P>
<P>
A new phase in Indonesia's history has just begun. The new
government has taken a series of positive and brave steps on the
political, economic, social, legal and diplomatic fronts. It is
hoped with good reasons that a new Indonesia with political
stability and economic prosperity will emerge under the Wahid
government which deserves the support of the whole nation. And a
stronger and developed Indonesia will also benefit peace and
stability in the region in particular and in the world as a whole.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Mechanized Paddy Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- An official with the Ministry
of Agriculture said that China will give priority to mechanizing
paddy production in its drive to accelerate agricultural
mechanization.
</P>
<P>
Paddy production mechanization in China lags behind wheat, corn
and other staple grains. In 1998, only 4 percent of rice planting
and 10 percent of harvesting were conducted with mechanized
equipment, said Niu Dun, director of the Agricultural
Mechanization Department attached to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"This does not conform to the important status of paddy
production in China," Niu said.
</P>
<P>
China's paddy acreage accounts for 30 percent of China's total
grain acreage while its output accounts for 40 percent of China's
grain output, making up 23 percent and 37 percent respectively of
the world's paddy acreage and output.
</P>
<P>
Niu attributed China's relatively low mechanized paddy
production to inadequate research and development of new
technologies and implements. He said that China should introduce
more advanced technologies and implements from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Mechanization Department will host an
international seminar on the mechanization of paddy production in
Beijing on April 10 to 11 next year, inviting officials, experts
and business people from around the world to discuss ways of
improving mechanized paddy production in China and put forward
development strategies.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will be held in conjunction with the Agro-Foodtech
Exposition April 11-14.

<HEADLINE> Survey: More Americans Send Holiday Greetings Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 23 (Xinhua) -- A survey released Thursday
by Dell Computer Corp. said more and more Americans are going
online this year to send holiday greetings to their friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
According to Dell's TechKnow Generation 2000 survey based on
interviews of 1,001 random computer users, 61 percent said they
have a family Web site or are interested in creating one.
</P>
<P>
"It's very popular," said Mark Feldman, a senior producer at
Yahoo! GeoCities, one of the biggest sites offering free space for
personal Web pages.
</P>
<P>
"Kids are all online. They're online at school, they're online
everywhere. Something like homepages for the holidays are giving
parents an opportunity to be online with the kids," Feldman added.
</P>
<P>
Internet experts say designing family homepages for specific
occasions is a growing trend in the United States as more
households get connected and Web design gets simpler.
</P>
<P>
It's no longer necessary to type in complicated codes or learn
computer languages. Users can buy Web design software or use one
of several online services that offer free space and programs.
</P>
<P>
Internet companies are taking advantage of the trend. "We're
trying to make it easier for them to do online," said Feldman.
</P>
<P>
Dell and Homestead. co., another personal Web page site,
offered 2,000 dollars toward a new computer to the owner of the
most creative family holiday page. Hundreds have entered the
contest.
</P>
<P>
"We're making sure that customers can easily take advantage of
technology," said Janet Mountain of Dell's consumer product
division.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Company Successfully Repurchases Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Shenneng Co.
, Ltd. has become the first publicly listed Chinese firm to
repurchase part of its state-owned shares.
</P>
<P>
The company has repurchased and written off one billion state-
owned shares held by the Shenneng (group) Co., Ltd. at 2.51 yuan
per share. Consequently, the equity of the firm has been reduced
from 2.6 billion shares to 1.6 billion shares, while its
registered capital has dropped from 2.6 billion yuan to 1.6
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Non-circulating state-owned shares now account for 68 percent
of its total equity, compared with 80 percent before the
repurchase. Public circulating shares accounts for 15 percent
compared to a previous 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The repurchase was carried out after being approved by the
Ministry of Finance, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Company officials said that the repurchase complies with
Corporate Law equity structure provisions and paves the way for
further improvement of its management.
</P>
<P>
The repurchase of state-owned shares has a healthy impact on
optimizing equity structure of China's publicly-listed firms,
securities analysts said.

<HEADLINE> More Than 600 Rescued From Sinking Ferry in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orlando Mercado, defense secretary and chairman of the National
Disaster Coordination Council, also said that 10 people have been
confirmed dead in the mishap while 38 are still missing.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Presidential Palace said earlier that the ship, with
578 passengers and 52 crew members on board, left Cebu City at 23:
00 (15:00 GMT) Wednesday for Iloilo City and capsized at 5:30
Thursday(21:30 GMT, Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
However, Trans-Asia Shipping Lines, owner of the ill-fated
ferry,said the ship carried 606 passengers and 56 crew members
when it left Cebu port.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers raced against time Friday to rescue 40 survivors
clinging to floating debris in the Visayan Sea more than 30 hours
after the ferry sank off the coast of Bantayan Island, some 10
nautical miles off the northernmost tip of Cebu.
</P>
<P>
Mel Capistrano, administrator of the Office of Civil Defense in
Cebu region, said the 40 survivors still at sea were spotted by
helicopters of the Philippine Air Force and Philippine Navy as of

</P>
<P>
Capistrano said rescue operations have been intensified to find
more survivors that may be at sea or washed away to seashores in
several islands and islets in northern Cebu.
</P>
<P>
He said the fatalities could have been high had the survivors
not been rescued immediately by three inter-island ships and some
fishermen who were fishing the area where the ill-fated 2,840-
gross ton ferry sank.
</P>
<P>
Big waves have hampered rescue work but the government said
rescue operations will not stop until all passengers and crew
members on board the ill-fated ferry are accounted for.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Top 10 World News Events of 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua News Agency today
selected world's top 10 world news events of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The following are the events in chronicle order:
</P>
<P>
1. Euro Is Born
</P>
<P>
Euro -- the single currency of the European Union (EU) -- was
born on January 1, sweeping away monetary borders between 11 of
the 15 EU member states and forging an integrated economic and
monetary alliance that Europe had been dreaming of for decades.
</P>
<P>
The birth of Euro, which helped enhancing the power of the EU
and promoting its economic and political integration, opened a new
era in which Europe will play a bigger role in a multipolar world.
</P>
<P>
As a challenge to the center position of the U.S. dollar in the
international monetary system, the Euro will exert major impact on
the global financial markets and on the development of world
economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone groups Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Finland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain
whose national currencies will remain in circulation till 2002.
</P>
<P>
2. U.S. Pushes ahead with Missile Defense System
</P>
<P>
On March 17 and 18, the U.S. Congress and Senate passed the
bill on the NMD system, making it a law to research and develop a
national missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
On October 13, the Senate rejected the ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) on nuclear weapons, which had
been adopted by the United Nations and signed by 154 countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. project to develop NMD and Theater Missile Defense
system in Asia will upset the global strategic balance and trigger
off new arms races in outer-space.
</P>
<P>
By refusing to ratify the CTBT, the U.S. aims to maintain its
nuclear deterrence, and as a result, will pose an incalculable,
serious negative impact on the international disarmament and
nuclear non-proliferation process.
</P>
<P>
3. NATO Bombs Yugoslavia
</P>
<P>
On March 24, without authorization from the United Nations
Security Council, the U.S.-led NATO forces launched military
strikes against a sovereign country -- the Yugoslav Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
The aggression, noted down as a dangerous precedent in the
history of international relations, posed serious threat to world
peace and development.
</P>
<P>
During the 78-day brutal bombings, NATO fighter jets powdered
21,000 tons of bombs down to the Yugoslav surface of 100,000
square kilometers. Thousands of civilians were killed and 6,000
wounded. Civil infrastructures, such as schools, factories,
bridges, hospitals, power plants and news media, were repeatedly
targeted.
</P>
<P>
At midnight on May 7, NATO attacked the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, killing three Chinese correspondents, injuring more than
20 diplomats and leaving the embassy building devastated.
</P>
<P>
NATO's barbaric act aroused strong indignation and condemnation
among the Chinese and all other peace-loving people in this world.
</P>
<P>
4. India, Pakistan Fight over Kashmir
</P>
<P>
India unleashed heavy air raids on May 26 to drive "the
Pakistani infiltrators" out of its controlled area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Amid the raids, India fighter jets frequently shelled across
the line of control the Pakistani side of Kashmir and met
counterattacks from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Then the two went into a two-month armed conflict, the worst
one since 1971; and both suffered heavy human losses.
</P>
<P>
During the conflict, India test-fired the medium-range
ballistic missile Agni-II and surface-to-air Trishul-II. Islamabad
answered with two missile tests -- the medium-range surface-to-
surface Ghauri-II and short-range ballistic Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflict and missile-launching aroused immediate
concern in the international community, which was worrying a
potential escalation of nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
5. Turkey Shaken by Earthquake
</P>
<P>
On the early morning of August 17, a powerful earthquake
measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale shook central and western
Turkey. On November 12, another quake measuring 7.2 hit western
Turkey again.
</P>
<P>
At least 18,000 people were killed, 43,000 injured and 600,000
became homeless following the two disasters. The economic damages
were estimated at 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The huge loss was mainly attributed to shoddy construction and
unscrupulous building contractors who had skimped on construction
materials and traded quality for speed, ending up in buildings
that massively collapsed once hit by earthquake.

6. Russia Sweeps Chechen Illegal Forces
</P>
<P>
In August-September, armed illegal Chechen forces trenched into
the neighboring Russian Republic Dagestan, and together with the
local separatists, ignited anti-government riots.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen terrorist forces also set a series of bomb blasts
in Moscow and other Russian cities, killing at least 300 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Having restored order in Dagestan, Russian federal forces then
launched a fierce military campaign in Chechnya to sweep out the
illegal forces and terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Now two thirds of Chechnya is under Russian control, and the
capital Grozny besieged.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 6,500 illegal armed militants have been
reportedly killed, and on the Russian federal side, 305 men have
been killed and 863 wounded.
</P>
<P>
The West has been critical of Russia's military campaign in
Chechnya; but Russia stressed that the Chechnya issue is its
internal affair and brooks no foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
7. China, U.S. Reach WTO Deal
</P>
<P>
China and the United States signed on November 15 a bilateral
agreement on China's entry into the World Trade Organization
following six days and nights of tough bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The "win-win" deal reached after 13 years of struggle was based
on mutual understanding and compromising. It is in the interests
of both sides and will help Sino-U.S. relations develop on a full
scale.
</P>
<P>
China's deal with the U.S., a major nation in WTO, will
accelerate its entry into the trade organization and inject new
impetus to world development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
8. Entire Sequence of Protein-Coding of Chromosome 22
Deciphered
</P>
<P>
On December 1, researchers from Britain, the United States and
Japan announced that they had deciphered the entire sequence of
the protein-coding genes of chromosome 22, mapping out its 33.4
million base pairs.
</P>
<P>
The achievement, a great scientific breakthrough, was the first
time that the entire sequence of genes of human chromosome was
mapped out.
</P>
<P>
Many diseases and syndromes, including some cancers,
immunodefiency, schizophrenia, retardation and heart disease, have
a genetic component linked to chromosome 22, the second smallest
of the 23 pairs of human chronosomes.
</P>
<P>
9. Panama Canal Returned to Panama
</P>
<P>
The return of Panama Canal to Panama was celebrated on December
14 at the Miraflores Locks at the canal's Pacific entrance, near
the city of Panama.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso and former U.S. president
Jimmy Carter signed exchange of notes by which the Panama Canal
was returned to Panama after 85 years of U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
The hand-over marked the victory of the Panamanian people's
long struggle to resume their sovereignty. With Panama Canal
returned, American colonialism in Panama and Latin America came to
a definite end.
</P>
<P>
According to the Torrijos-Carter treaties of 1977, the formal
delivery of the canal will be held on December 31, 1999. Before
the date, every and all U.S. troops should have been withdrawn out
of the canal region.
</P>
<P>
10. China Resumes Exercise of Sovereignty over Macao
</P>
<P>
On December 20, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced that
China officially resumed exercise of sovereignty over Macao at a
hand-over ceremony.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Macao Special Administrative Region
government came into power.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao marked a great national event in the
Chinese history and a milestone in the country's cause of
reunification following Hong Kong's return in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Trees Protect Agricultural Production in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 24 (Xinhua) --Sand-blown winds have become
less aggressive in northeast China's Jilin Province after trees
were planted in millions of hectares of semi-arid land.
</P>
<P>
 Jilin province, a major commodity grain base, used to be
threatened by sand, drought and waterlogging for decades. In 1978,
a hectare of farmland yielded less than 1,500 kg of crops.
</P>
<P>
 To prevent further decline of agricultural production in the
province, the government began to plant more trees in 1978. To
date, 1.18 million hectares of waste land have been covered with
grass, bushes and trees.
</P>
<P>
 The afforestation campaign has increased the unit yield of
crops by 360 percent and provided more fuel wood for local
residents.
</P>
<P>
 Jilin has pumped 900 million yuan (about 108 million U.S.
dollars) into afforestation, with more than 40 percent of the
funds coming from local farmers.
</P>
<P>
 In the next ten years, the province plans to plant trees in
another 410,000 hectares of land to shield farm land from the
menace of sandstorm.

<HEADLINE> Taxis to Use Natural Gas in Central China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua)-- Taxis in Zhengzhou, capital
of Henan province in central China, will become enviromentally
friendly next year, when they start to use natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongyuan Oilfield and the city's administrative bureau of
passenger transportation has recently signed an agreement on
building five natural gas stations in the city next year to allow
taxis to use natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The project will be extend to buses and other public vehicles
in the city, following the first testing program on taxis.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "green" fuel of automobiles, natural gas emits
almost no lead pollution. Some experts say that the contents of
hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and other pollutants in the emission
of natural gas-fueled automobiles are 84-96 percent less than
those of gasoline-generated ones. The adoption of natural gas to
replace gasoline will undoubtedly help curb air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Zhongyuan oilfield is abundantly rich in natural gas
reserves. It has developed a comprehensive system to exploit,
process and transport natural gas and byproducts. The oilfield
also leads the country in the research and development of
automobile technology in China.

ZHENGZHOU, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 125,000 environmentally-
friendly refrigerators made by the Xinfei Electric Co. Ltd. in
central China's Henan Province will be exported to the U.S. with
the help of the U.S.-based General Electric (GE).
</P>
<P>
Liu Bingyin, president of the Xinfei Co., and Wang Jianmin,
chairman and chief of executives (COE) of the GE (China), are
delighted with the partnership and hope for further cooperation in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that GE will increase its imports. The growth rate of
imports for 1999 is more than 50 percent over last year and is
expected to reach 80 percent within the next two or three years,
he added.
</P>
<P>
GE's imports accounted for one fourth of U.S. trade worth 100.5
billion U.S.dollars last year. GE chose to work with Xinfei -- one
of three main refrigerator manufacturers in China -- because they
were satisfied with its operations, quality and productive
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Xinfei Co. has made enormous efforts to develop environmentally-
friendly products. It is expected to increase the refrigerator
exports to 300,000 refrigerators next year, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
GE and Hefei Co. will work in still closer cooperation to
promote and develop household electric appliances.

<HEADLINE> Chinese College Students Collect Used Batteries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A used battery collection
campaign is underway at universities in Changchun, capital of
Jilin Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
"We see used batteries scattered all over the place causing
excess rubbish. Hydrargyrum and zinc from batteries is also
harmful to people's health," said Li Daning, a freshman at Jilin
University, who organized the campaign.
</P>
<P>
With his roommates, Li pasted posters and went door-knocking at
the college for used batteries in early November. And after
several days of work they collected more than 400 batteries. A
dormitory hotline number was also set up.
</P>
<P>
The efforts of Li and his team of collectors soon attracted
wide public support. Student Unions at other universities soon
took their cue from Li.
</P>
<P>
Students use large amounts of batteries. Walkmans, radios and
tape recorders are constantly used by students in their daily
studies. The annual production of batteries for China is about 14
billion.
</P>
<P>
By early December, tertiary students in Jilin accumulated
nearly 2,000 batteries. These batteries will be passed on to the
Changchun's Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Environmental protection is everyone's responsibility. We
would actively support efforts of the students," said Ma Hongxiang,
who runs the Publicity and Education Center at the Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau is now looking into ways to best deal with used
batteries.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Recovery Starts on Sheep and Beef Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's "sheep and
beef farms will start to recover this season from the adverse
conditions experienced over the last two years", Rob Davison,
executive director of the Meat and Wool Economic Service of New
Zealand, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Davison said in a media release, the initial recovery
will "concentrate on rebuilding stock numbers and reducing debt.
Overall, the farm cash blow remains tightly stretched and several
good years are required to ease the pressure."
</P>
<P>
He noted that a key driver of this season's recovery was the
excellent lambing percentage achieved during the spring and a mild
winter and settled spring resulted in an excellent lamb crop with
total lamb numbers similar to last season.
</P>
<P>
Beef production is expected to show a small lift this season
driven by some recovery in the South Island over the last season
and higher wool production is also expected this season as
favorable seasonal conditions from autumn 1999 onwards are
reflected in improved wool growth, Davison said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in New Zealand's offshore markets, prices for most
of its agricultural exports are recovering from their low levels
of the last two to four seasons.
</P>
<P>
Davison predicted that New Zealand's Wool prices are expected
to be slightly up on last season, driven mostly by demand for fine
wool, and lower pork production in the European Union will benefit
New Zealand's lamb prices.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's beef prices are increasing in the U.S. market as
the North American beef herd moves into a rebuilding phase, and
pork production declines from record levels, he said, adding: "
Recovery in the Asian economies will lift their imports of beef
and assist beef prices to rise."

<HEADLINE> British Envoy Warns Against Deteriorating Political Situation in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- British High Commissioner to
Bangladesh David Walker warned if Bangladesh's political situation
continued to deteriorate, foreign investment would cease to come
and donors wont's be in position to help, newspapers here reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The big problem in Bangladesh at the moment is the political
situation, political difficulties, Walker said in an interview
with the local medium here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy thinks the country could really turn around
if core issues like population, poverty and environmental
degradation could be addressed on the basis of national consensus
and through effective partnership with the donor community.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that diplomats quite rightly are not supposed
to get involved in internal affairs of any country. But, diplomats,
particularly from the donor countries and the development partners
of Bangladesh, have legitimate interest in the situation, "because
so much of taxpayers' money is being used in Bangladesh," he said.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example of British aid, he said Britain is spending
about 100 million U.S. dollars every year on development projects
in Bangladesh as direct assistance from the British government. So,
he argued, British taxpayers have legitimate right to know whether
the money is being used properly.
</P>
<P>
About the opposition's repeated hartal (destructive strike)
calls in their bid to pull down the government, he said that in
parliamentary democracy, there is only way to move: a successful
no-confidence motion against the government. If hartal continues,
it will destroy the prospect of conquering poverty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party-led opposition alliance has intensified it's anti-government
movement, demanding earlier general elections under a caretaker
government. The incessant political confrontation has cramped the
stability as well as the economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, the country's industrial growth rate has declined to 2.5
percent in last fiscal (1998-99) from 9.5 percent in the previous
year. Export growth has also sharply declined from 16.83 to 2.94
percent over the same period.

<HEADLINE> Italian New Government Wins Confidence Vote in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Italy's new government headed by
Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema was approved by parliament after
winning a vote of confidence in the lower house Thursday night. It
had won a confidence vote in the Senate earlier the same day.
</P>
<P>
The new center-left government, the 57th since World War Two,
won in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, by 310 votes to
287. There were 18 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The approval represented an end to the cabinet crisis, which
started when D'Alema's former government was brought down Saturday
by three small rebel parties in the 14-month-old coalition.
</P>
<P>
However, D'Alema and his center-left coalition's majority was
weakened after the three rebel parties were rejected from the new
government.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema addressed the Chamber of Deputies before the voting. He
said the electoral reform aimed at attaining the goal of democracy
and political stability, was one of the basic objectives of the
new government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed political stability is much needed when economic
recovery has just occurred in Italy. He also was confident the
goal of 21 million jobs for his people will be reached by the
spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the division among the center-left coalition,
D'Alema said reform-oriented dialogue should continue inside the
coalition to clear up political misunderstandings. All reform
forces should be united, he said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema was asked to form a new government by President Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi Monday after his resignation Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Makes Progress in Warring Against Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia, the biggest country
in South East Asia, has made encouraging progress in warring
against drug traffickers and drug abuse in 1999. And the
government pledged to continue its war in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government intensified actions against drug
during the last year in view of the increase of drug trafficking
and drug abuse in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the National Police, in 1999, the
police successfully seized tons of marijuana, kilograms of heroin
and ten of thousands of sedative pills.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Indonesian drug addicts were not merely civilians
but also military and police personnel.
</P>
<P>
The National Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi admitted earlier
that at least 136 policemen were addicted to drug in 1999, saying
the number is predicted to increase as the urine test had not
finished yet.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 136 police were involved in drug abuse, 57 personnel
had been reassigned," Roesmanhadi said.
</P>
<P>
The victims of drug addict also is predicted to keep increasing.
</P>
<P>
As of early December, 30 Indonesian (mostly teenager) have died
for overdose while two millions other have been addicted (to drug).
And 82 percent of drug addict have consumed (drug) intentionally.
</P>
<P>
"Of the two million of drug addict nationwide, 1.3 million are
Jakartan," a report said.
</P>
<P>
An Indonesian psychiatrist disclosed that 130 billion rupiah (
18.6 million U.S. dollars) had been spent out on drug a day.
</P>
<P>
The data is convinced to keep rising, as the supply of heroin
into Indonesia have reached 40 to 50 kilograms per month according
to police spokesman Brig. Gen. Erald Dotulong.
</P>
<P>
This is not an easy job to combat against the drug circulation
as it is controlled by a well-organized international syndicate as
such Cali from Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Looking on the worsening situation of drug affairs, many
parties including the House of Representatives (DPR) pressed the
government to take firmer action against drug abuser.
</P>
<P>
In responding to the demands, the Indonesian government under
President Abdurrahman Wahid had pledged to quell the drug
circulation and consumption nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The president even considers to propose a death penalty that
would be imposed to drug dealers or traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Social experts held that the war (against drug abuse) is far
from over. While a new millennium is coming, the government has
promised to keep combating against the drug.

"It's important you take stock and make sure things are in good
shape and make a judgement whether you can keep racing or not,"
said Bush, chairman of the committee which reviewed safety after
the fatal 1998 race.
</P>
<P>
Skippers were told to expect a much better 1999 race, with a
fast spinnaker run down the coast after the start on December 26.
</P>
<P>
Under new safety rules all yachts will carry Satcom C satellite
communications which will identify and track boats throughout the
630-nautical mile race.
</P>
<P>
Some new safety rules apply even before the gun goes off.
</P>
<P>
All crew must now be registered, have a minimum of 150 nautical
miles under their belts, and 30 percent must have attended safety
seminars. A minimum age of 18 has been set, which prevents some
seasoned young "Hobarters" setting sail this year.
</P>
<P>
Failure to comply means a yacht will not be allowed to start or
will be disqualified if they compete.
</P>
<P>
Skippers must notify race organisers if they encounter severe
weather conditions above 40-knot winds -- racing skippers
traditionally refuse to divulge weather conditions, fearing their
competitors may take advantage of the information.
</P>
<P>
Before passing Green Cape and entering the Bass Strait, yachts
must confirm radios, engine and batteries work, liferafts are
onboard, and all crew are in good shape to keep racing.
</P>
<P>
Race officials again stressed the major rule of ocean racing --
safety at sea rests with the skipper.
</P>
<P>
"A boat is solely responsible for deciding whether or not to
start or to continue racing," said Hugo van Kretschmar,commodore
of race organiser the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Copper Price Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Copper closed Thursday in the
international market at 82.89 dollar cents per pound, the highest
quotation since May 6 last year, Chilean authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The metal's average monthly price went to 79.45 cents of a
dollar and the yearly average to 71.20 cents with the quotation of
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The state Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) forecast that
the annual average price of copper will vary between 81 and 86
dollar cents per pound in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cochilco executive vice-president Eduardo Titelman attributed
the price uplift to the supply contraction and a recovering world
economy.
</P>
<P>
The quotation could advance to the record high of 95-100 cents
per pound, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chile's copper exports increased by 22 percent in November to a
value of 544.5 million dollars, the Chilean Central Bank announced
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Chile Third in Mergers and Purchases in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Merger and Purchase
operations recorded a total value of 13 billion U.S. dollars in
Chile this year, rating the country at 18th place in the world and
third in Latin America behind Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The rating was published Thursday from a study made by the U.S.
Thomson Financial Securities Data firm.
</P>
<P>
The economic sectors mostly affected were services, banks,
beverage and mining industries.
</P>
<P>
Mergers and acquisitions in all of Latin America dropped to 62
billion U.S. dollars this year, down 26.5 percent from the record
86.4 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The political and economic instability undergone in the region
this year has an important effect on these operations, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the high figures of the previous years were attributed
to massive programs of privatization.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and Argentina will
soon sign an agreement to establish a motor vehicle regime for the
next two months, an official said in Sao Paulo Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, the two countries will coordinate the imports
and exports of motor vehicles and parts in a one-to-one system
between the two biggest partners of the Southern Common Market (
Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
The agreement is regarded as a means to prevent a vacuum in
motor vehicle sales as the present car deal between the two
countries expires on December 31.
</P>
<P>
The trade dispute, especially in the field of cars between
Brazil and Argentina, has been a major problem within the
Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The domestic car market in Argentina has been weak since mid-
1998 affected by the worldwide economic crisis and the devaluation
of Brazil currency, in particular. Its car sales in the first
quarter dropped by 50 percent this year compared with the same
period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
To help bring the car industry out of trouble, the Argentine
government announced an ban on imports of some of Brazilian
products on July 22.
</P>
<P>
Brazil reacted strongly to Argentina's trade protectionism,
unilaterally suspending trade negotiations on cars with Argentina
on July 26.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Manuel
Villar said Thursday that Congress is practically sure of
approving government-backed changes to the current constitution,
Business World said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Villar was quoted as saying that although Congress is still to
receive a copy of the Preparatory Commission for Constitution
Reform (PCCR) report, solons would soon start studying the
commission's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, it will be approved," he said, adding
that it would be better if lawmakers, before starting to discuss
the possible amendments, will have already have a consensus on the
reforms.
</P>
<P>
In its report to President Joseph Estrada, the PCCR recommended
the lifting of constitution restrictions on foreign equity in
natural resources use, public utilities.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested the lifting of restrictions on foreigner's
ownership of land.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments triggered controversy nationwide, which
was highlighted by two mass protest rallies in August and
September.
</P>
<P>
Some opponents said they fear lawmakers will seek some "hidden
political agenda" from the economic amendments while others held
the charter revision will hurt the national economy fundamentally.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Attract 2nd Record Investment in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's foreign direct
investment (FDI) has increased for the fourth year and is expected
to hit the second highest level ever in 1999, the Board of
Investment (BOI) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The investment will rise to 175 million U.S. dollars this year,
a 12.9 percent increase over 1998, the BOI said in a statement.

The projects were the Shell Gas Terminal, Colombo Power Limited,
South Asia Gateway Terminal, Dialog GSM, Suntel, Puttalam Cement,
CHICO, Loadstar, Lanka Bell, Mobitel and Ansel.

During the past five years 320 new companies with foreign
equity participation have been implemented, bringing FDI at 540
million dollars, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Safety Body Grounds All Light Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- All light aircraft in
Australia were grounded on Friday by the aviation safety body
pending checks over potentially dangerous contaminated fuel.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) said it had issued a
directive to all light aircraft operators over the fuel, which has
already caused one aborted take-off.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Peter Gibson said the directive required all aircraft
to be checked for the contaminated fuel by a qualified maintenance
engineer.
</P>
<P>
He said if the contaminated fuel were found, certain steps must
be taken to clean the engine.
</P>
<P>
Since news of the contaminated fuel was released Thursday, the
CASA had received numerous reports from around Australia of light
aircraft with engines running roughly.
</P>
<P>
However, there had been no further incidents reported.
</P>
<P>
Gibson said the directive had been faxed to aircraft operators
around Australia and posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
He said the nature of the contamination of the fuel remained a
mystery, except that it was a "black, sticky" substance.
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a contamination of a chemical nature. You can't
see it," Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
The fuel had been traced following a recent incident in the
Victoria state when a light aircraft suffered engine failure just
before take-off.
</P>
<P>
"The take-off was aborted after the engine failed and the plane
was taken back and the engine stripped back to discover what went
wrong," Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
"They tracked back from that and found that the fuel had
started corroding parts in the fuel system of the aircraft, the
carburetor and the fuel system," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This was causing deposits in the engine which then caused the
engine to fail," he added.

<P>
CANBERRA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Friday called for vigilance against computer viruses and hacking
over the new year period.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Daryl Williams and acting Communications
Minister Ian Campbell said there had been reports from the United
States about the possibility of increased hacking and virus
attacks using the Y2K bug as cover.
</P>
<P>
They said industry and the community needed to adopt extra
vigilance to protect computer systems particularly in the period
of January 1 to 4.
</P>
<P>
They said steps which can be taken to further protect computer
systems included ensuring that all security patch software updates
are in place and that the latest anti-virus software updates are
loaded.
</P>
<P>
The measures also included monitoring for unexplained activity
such as an increase in failed password attempts and exercising
caution when opening unexpected e-mail or attachments.
</P>
<P>
"The commonwealth has established a watch office over the
critical period to identify problems and to provide a swift and
coordinated response if necessary," they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
More detailed information on protective measures is available
at the Australian Computer Emergency Response Team website, they

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid has freed all political prisoners and detainees
and reduced the sentences of 3,800 other prisoners who are still
in cells across the country.
</P>
<P>
"By issuing a decree, we hope there will be no more political
prisoners or detainees left in their cells," Law and Legislation
Minister Yusril Ihza Mahendra was quoted by national newspapers
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He admitted there could be a few political prisoners the
government doesn't know about.
</P>
<P>
"If there are families who have a relative still in jail (as a
political prisoner or detainee), they can contact the Law and
Legislation Ministry," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time the president has issued a decree
freeing political prisoners since his election as president in
October. He freed 91 political prisoners earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The final batch of political prisoners to be released by the
latest presidential decree are mostly those who were involved in
separatist movements in Irian Jaya, East Timor and Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, 72 will receive amnesty and 33 will have
their sentences abolished.
</P>
<P>
To mark Christmas and Idul Fitri, the president even granted
special sentence reductions to 3,800 of the some 38,000 criminal
convicts across the country. The president traditionally grants
such reductions to mark the country's independence day on August
17.
</P>
<P>
Idul Fitri is the feast to celebrate the success of Muslim in
adhering to Islamic principles during Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a breakthrough of the present government. Now a
prisoner can get two sentence reductions in a year," said Yusril.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Impose Duties on Rice, Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to impose duties on rice, white sugar and industrial sugar
imports effective January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
"The measures have been approved by the IMF (International
Monetary Fund)," Industry and Trade Minister Jusuf Kalla was
quoted by the Antara News Agency Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The duty on rice imports would be 30 percent, on white sugar
imports 25 percent and on industrial sugar imports 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said if the disparity in price between home-grown
and imported rice was allowed to continue, Indonesian rice farmers
would suffer.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, if rice imports are not limited, Indonesia could
become the biggest rice importer in the world as farmers would
then become reluctant to plant rice," he added.
</P>
<P>
The import duty on rice would be evaluated within the next
eight months while the percentage of the import duty could then be
reset based on the prevailing rice prices at home and abroad as
well as the rate of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar, Kalla said.
</P>
<P>
Another decision the government had taken was to allow general
importers to import rice of all types whereas so far they had been
permitted to import only first quality rice.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for easing the restriction on general importers
was the strengthening of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar,
beside a drop in the world rice price.
</P>
<P>
Starting January 1 next year, the government would also give
general importers the freedom to import sugar. So far, only sugar-
producing importers can bring in the commodity into the country.
</P>
<P>
The 25 percent duty on white sugar imports and the 20 percent
duty on industrial sugar imports would be maintained for three
years, Kalla added.

<HEADLINE> Special Congressional Session Called on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada asked Congress Thursday to convene in special session
earlier next year, to pass the national budget for the year 2000,
Manila Bulletin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora was quoted as saying that
the president wants the special session held on January 10 to pass
the proposed budget, which lawmakers failed to ratify Wednesday,
the last working day of the year.
</P>
<P>
The postponement comes from the disagreement in the bicameral
conference committee on how to spread some 30-billion-peso (750-
million- U.S. dollar) cuts brought about by the restoration of the
internal revenue allocation of the local government units.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, Estrada assured the public that the delivery
of basic services will not be affected despite the failure of
Congress to approve the 2000 national budget before year ends.
</P>
<P>
"This will not affect the delivery of basic services. They
will continue unhampered," Zamora said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Destroys 372 Hectares Poppy Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities destroyed a
total of 372.3 hectares of poppy fields scattered in six townships
of the country's northern Shan state in less than four months
between September and mid-December this year, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The six townships are Muse, Loilem, Phekhon, Hopong, Loikaw and
Mindat.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being continued to search and destroy the illegally
grown poppy plantations in the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
There is reportedly a total of 61,236 hectares of poppy
plantation area in the country with an annual opium production of
665.28 tons which could be refined into 66.52 tons of heroin.
</P>
<P>
In its opium eradication efforts, Myanmar has been carrying out
cultivation of poppy-substitute crops in areas where poppy was
planted.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the cultivation area of poppy-substitute crops, which
also include paddy, corn, sugarcane, wheat, coffee seedlings and
rubber, stood at 5,898 hectares, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Due to the expanded cultivation areas of these substitute crops,
poppy cultivation has reportedly reduced to a significant degree
in Myanmar in the year.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities have claimed that the decline in poppy
cultivation in the country is 16 percent in 1998 and 31 percent in
1999, while the drop of narcotics production is 26 percent in 1998
and 38 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has started in 1999 implementing a three-phase plan (
1999-2014 at an estimated cost of 5.6 billion U.S. dollars, aimed
at the total eradication of drugs in the whole country in 15 years
after the successful transformation of the eastern Shan state's
Mongla region into an opium-free zone in April 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ho Chi Minh City Records 6 Pct of Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The economy of Ho Chi Minh City
has increased by 6 percent over the last year, local English daily
Vietnam News (VNS) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure has showed substantial slowdown in the economic
growth of the Vietnam's economic hub this year.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Ho Chi Minh City Statistics Bureau show that
from 1996-1998 the average annual growth rate was 12 percent
compared to 14.1 percent from 1993-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
This drop in growth was across all economic sectors in Ho Chi
Minh City, VNS quoted the Bureau as saying, adding that what is
most alarming is that growth is deteriorating each year. in 1996
economic growth was 0.7 percent less than the previous year, it
was 2.5 percent less in 1997 than that in 1996 and it fell 2.9
percent in 1998 from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The regional crisis was not the main reason for this economic
downturn but rather the inefficiency of the local economy was to
blame.
</P>
<P>
Obsolete production facilities and a lack of modern management
systems are contributing to the falling effectiveness of the city'
s economy.
</P>
<P>
Sixty nine percent of Ho Chi Minh City-based manufacturers,
according to the Bureau, last year had difficulty selling their
products. This, in turn, affected the income for Ho Chi Minh City
residents and their purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth in the city dropped from 36.7 percent in 1996
to 18.5 percent in 1997 and minus 1.9 percent in 1998. For
investors, doing business in the city is getting harder and the
situation is likely to worsen in the next few years as the level
of investment continues to slide, VNS added.

COLOMBO, December 24 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Sri Lanka's main

responded positively to President Chandrika Kumaratunga's appeal
to him to cooperate with her in the search for peace.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Davis Cup Team to Warm up in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Davis Cup team
will warm up in three future tournaments in India prior to the
Davis Cup Asia Oceania Zone Group II first round match against the
Philippines in February in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Coach Dedy Prasetyo said the six members of the team will
compete in the clay-court Future 1 tournament in Hyderabad from
January 10 to 16; the Future 2 in Bangalore from January 17 to 23;
and in the hard-court Future 3 in Chennai from January 24 to 29.
</P>
<P>
"We shall observe the players' tactical understanding,
emotionalcontrol and mistake management at the tournaments. The
first point is to see if the players are able to overcome
different type of players, be they serve-and-volleyers, baseliner
or counterattacker types," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The second point is to see if the players can control their
emotions, especially when they are under pressure at critical
points. They must be able to decide when to play aggressively,
when to defend and when to counterattack. This can only be gained
in tournaments and not in practice sessions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The last point to observe is if they make unforced errors,
especially at critical moments of a match. Usually our players
tend to overhit in the deciding points which results in errors.
They must also develop their mental endurance as they will play
five sets in the Davis Cup matches in Manila," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Tennis Association will announce the core team
off our players, one substitute and the coaches on January 4, one
day before they fly to India.
</P>
<P>
The team will fly directly to Manila to adapt to the conditions
before competing from February 4 to 6.

<HEADLINE>   KR Trial Will Never be Internationalized: Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen vowed Friday that Cambodian government will never allow
the trial of Khmer Rouge to be internationalized.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks before the meeting of the Council of
Minister to debate the draft law of trying the former Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also rejected the suggestion from the
representative of the United Nations that Cambodia should sign an
agreement with the organization if it wants to get fund from the
United Nations on the Khmer Rouge trial.
</P>
<P>
"I have rejected it," Hun Sen said, " We should not rely on the
United Nations to try the Khmer Rouge and ask them for money. We
will resolve the issue by ourselves."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hun Sen pointed out that what they want is to make
the trial of the Khmer Rouge internationalized. He stressed that
all expenses for the Cambodian judges are to be paid by the Royal
Government of Cambodia, while the foreign judges should pay the
expenses by themselves if they want to participate in the trial
process.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said, however, that the draft law put on debate Friday
has already included a number of provisions which have not been
presented in the earlier plans but put forward by some foreign
legal experts.
</P>
<P>
The royal government has already put forward the draft law to
the United Nations, which outlined how to try the former Khmer
Rouge leaders and asked the United Nations to reply before Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I won't wait for the OK from New York, because the person who
gives the OK is in Phnom Penh," Hun Sen stressed earlier.

<HEADLINE> Rules Tightened to Protect Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Officials from the patent,
copyright and trademark administrations are now trying to improve
the protection of intellectual property rights by revising
relevant laws, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China has to revise the Trademark Law to implement the
Agreements on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS) upon entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
said Cao Zhongqiang, vice-director of the Trademark Department of
State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Cao made the remarks at a symposium on WTO and China's
intellectual property rights protection that opened Thursday in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The current Trademark Law, which went into effect in 1993, has
played a vital role in safeguarding the interests and rights of
commodity producers.
</P>
<P>
"More provisions need to be added to the law to meet the
challenge of competition in a market economy," the paper quoted
Cao as saying.
</P>
<P>
TRIPS is the agreement related to intellectual property rights
required by the WTO. The measure covers a wider range of
intellectual property rights than other relevant treaties, said Li
Shuande, vice-director of the Intellectual Property Rights Center
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China should bridge the gap between current law and TRIPS to
implement patent, copyright and trademark laws, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Xu Chao, an official with the National Copyright Administration,
said that his department has submitted a proposal for the revision
of the Copyright Law to the State Council.
</P>
<P>
But China still faces problems in copyright legislation and
enforcement. Punishments for even serious piracy offenses remain
relatively light, said Xu.

LOS ANGELES -- The trade accord between China and the United
States and the prospect of China's accession to the World Trade
Organization will likely lift global growth and accelerate the
pace of domestic investment in China, according to an analysis
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the growth rate in China was projected to be 8 percent and
that of Asia 6.7 percent before the trade agreement, these rates
are likely to increase to 10 percent and 7 percent respectively,
said the analysis by the Conference Board, a U.S. business
membership and research organization with a worldwide network
linking some 3,000 companies in 67 countries. "This upward
revision is based on an anticipated acceleration in the Chinese
investment growth rate to 12 percent -- a rate roughly equal to
the post-1989 average, but well below the growth rates of the mid-
1990s," the Conference Board said.  (China-US-Trade)

<HEADLINE> Lower Power Prices for Chinese Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in more than a quarter
of China's rural areas are expecting electricity prices at the
same level in urban areas next year, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Electricity in rural areas usually costs more than in cities
due to the inferior rural power grids and management systems.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Chinese government decided to invest 190 billion
yuan (about 22.9 billion U.S. dollars) in rural power grid
construction between 1999 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, a total of 55 billion yuan (some 6.5
billion U.S. dollars) will have been directed into more than 440
counties across the country, according to Zeng Peiyan, minister in
charge of the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The country is planning to invest another 55 billion yuan to
renovate and improve the power grid next year.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 counties will have completed their power grid
construction next year.
</P>
<P>
County-level power enterprises will no longer be under the
direct control of local governments. All township power management
stations will be reformed as interior institutions of county-level
power companies, China Daily said.

<HEADLINE> Draft Law on Seeds Submitted for Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 24 (Xinhua) -- A draft law submitted to
China's top legislative body says the selection, testing and
promotion of genetically modified seeds in China would have to
undergo safety evaluations.
</P>
<P>
The draft law establishes a State approval system for domestic
and imported genetically modified seeds, "China Daily" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Mao Daru, member of the National People's Congress Agriculture
and Rural Affairs Committee, said "we would be very careful in
dealing with genetically modified seeds because there is a lot of
uncertainty regarding the effects of genetically modified crops on
our health and the environment."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted another legislator Gao Dezhan as saying the
draft seeds law aims to regulate the seeds market and improve
seeds quality, thereby better protecting the country's seeds
resources and farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
The benefits from seeds belong to the nation and any theft or
destruction of seeds resources should be banned, the draft says.
</P>
<P>
The State Seeds Bank currently has 350,000 seeds in more than
200 varieties, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The draft law requires the government to establish a seed fund
to support basic seed research, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 23 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Tottenham Hotspur supporters want a public apology from the
club after their 6-1 FA Cup defeat at Newcastle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tottenham Action Group would also like to see supporters
who travelled to St James' Park given their money back.
</P>
<P>
TAG spokesman Mark Jacob said:"Perhaps the club should utilise
its Jumbotron screens before the game against Watford on Sunday to
display a public apology for the shambolic performance at
Newcastle."
</P>
<P>
"It would also be a nice gesture for Christmas for the board of
directors to offer money to back to fans who loyally made the trek
to support their team at St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
"Given that the third round of the FA Cup has been brought
forward we feel that our season is effectively over, despite the
fact that our manager George Graham is spinning the line that a
UEFA Cup place is still a possibility via the league."
</P>
<P>
Graham has already offered his own apologies for Tottenham's
heaviest defeat in the FA Cup since March 1928.
</P>
<P>
The manager called Wednesday's match a "comedy of errors".
</P>
<P>
"I take my share of the responsibility. I feel particularly
sorry for the fans who travelled to St James' Park," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed, not just by the result but the manner of
our defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Individually too many of my players were, putting it politely,
below par.
</P>
<P>
"It hurts to lose like that but the important thing now is that
I put it right," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 23 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose
sharply Thursday on the news about the moderate economic growth,
lifting all three major indexes to a new high close.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 202.16 at 11,405.76,
surpassing the record closing high of 11,326.04 set on August 25.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 22.21 at 1,458.34, reaching a record high and the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 32.14 at the record
closing high of 3,969.44.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq index ,which hit the 4,000 milestone for the first
time in Thursday's session, set the 57th new record and rose 80
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Commerce Department reported that
Americans' personal income rose by 0.4 percent in November, the
slowest pace since August, while consumer spending rose by 0.5
percent in the same month, less than a strong rise of 0.7 percent
in October.
</P>
<P>
The moderate economic growth eased worries about higher
inflation among investors. The consumer spending accounts for two-
thirds of the U.S. economic activities.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE rose 9.90 at 644.06 and the American Stock Exchange
index rose 6.85 at 846.28. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 4.49 at 482.43.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,936 up, 1,150 down and 478
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 726.90 million shares from 844.20
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> IMF Reduces Credit to Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 23 (Xinhua) -- The amount of credit the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be able to grant to Ecuador
has been reduced from 400 million to 250 million U.S. dollars,
Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Arizaga said that the loan that the IMF would have granted was
400 million dollars for a term of 18 months, but that after the
negotiations with the IMF, a reduction of 150 million was
established.
</P>
<P>
But the term of the credit has also been reduced from 18 months
to 12 months. Ecuador had negotiated an agreement for 18 months,
but delays in the negotiations reduced the term to 12 months,
added Arizaga.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts and former Finance Minister Francisco Switt
called a historical mistake the fact that the present regime had
put all its hopes in an agreement with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Switt said that to have sought a sole key through a sole door,
meaning that of the IMF, has been a historical strategic error of
the regime, with such a painful significance for Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, "because we have literally dropped on our knees,
without any reason, before the IMF, to be told at the last minute
that it will not lend us 400 million dollars but only 250 million
dollars, when for other countries, like Colombia, the IMF approved
a 2.7 billion dollar credit, meaning 10 times more than what it
approved for Ecuador."
</P>
<P>
"This has made us look like international beggars. If we want
the country to get ahead, we must recover our collective dignity,
and that means to see the rest of the world in another way," said
Arizaga.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Ruling Party Refuses to Share Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is unacceptable to demand those who have just won an
election to share power with those who have not, Mozambique News
Agency Thursday quoted Mariano Matsinha, head of the Frelimo
election office, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Matsinha said that this does not mean that everyone
invited into the new government would necessarily be a
card-carrying member of Frelimo.
</P>
<P>
The veiled threats of disturbances now being made by Renamo are
neither surprising nor particularly worrying, he said, stressing
that there is no possibility for Renamo to reconstitute itself as
a military force and pose a threat to the current climate of peace
and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
The election results, announced on Wednesday, showed that
Frelimo will have a majority of 133 seats in the 250-seat new
parliament, while the incumbent President Joaquim Chissano beat
his rival candidate, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, by winning 52.
3 percent of the votes against 47.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agrees on Two-Year Budget, 2 Million U.S. Dollar Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 54th General Assembly session will give the final stamp of
approval late Thursday following the end of protracted
negotiations, led by the Australian permanent representative to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, the U.N. undersecretary-general for
administration and management, called the budget another example
of "remarkable financial discipline."
</P>
<P>
"It should be recalled that the budget for 1994-1995 was 2.632
billion U.S. dollars, roughly 100 million U.S. dollars more than
for the budget that has just been enacted," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has called the tight budget a
"starvation diet."
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of the new budget means that the secretariat will
be working with the same or less level of resources since 1994,
over eight years," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
The agreed budget pays for regular expenses of secretariat
staff under Annan and contributions to it are mandatory.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier this week paid 151 million U.S.
dollars to the United Nations, a move just to avoid the loss of
its vote in the General Assembly next year, which is automatic
under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter if a country fails to pay its
mandatory due payments.
</P>
<P>
In total, Washington has paid more than 700 million U.S.
dollars for dues and peacekeeping to the world body since
September this year, thereby leaving the United Nations with a
cash balance of some 110 million for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which is the largest debtor yet, is seeking
to reduce its assessment from 25 percent to 22 percent, but the
intention met with strong criticism at the United Nations.
