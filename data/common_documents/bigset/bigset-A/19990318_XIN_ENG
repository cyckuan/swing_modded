<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Expand Nuclear Cooperation With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Atomic Energy Minister
Yevgeny Adamov said Wednesday that his country will expand its
cooperation with Iran in nuclear energy programs.
</P>
<P>
Adamov said that Moscow will honor its commitments to Tehran in
such programs and that the activities are consistent with
guidelines on nuclear nonproliferation, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said Russia will step up the construction of the
first power unit in the Busher nuclear power station where over
1,000 nuclear and construction engineers are working.
</P>
<P>
Iran wants Russia to build three more power units in Busher and
such offer creates jobs and keeps factories running in Russia, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Adamov said that during his visit to the United States next
week he will "patiently explain to Iran in the development of
nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the minister said, he will tell the Americans
that the Research and Design Institute of Power Engineering and
the Mendeleyev Institute of Chemical Technology do not work on
nuclear weapons and do not cooperate with Iran in that field.
</P>
<P>
The two facilities were among a number of Russian institutions
that the United States accused of cooperation with Iran in weapons
programs, a charge denied by Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Primakov Say Skuratov Can not Retain Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday that Yuri
Skuratov can not work as the prosecutor general because the post
requires "morally unstained" people.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by the Kremlin press service, came in
the wake of the Federation Council's rejection of Skuratov's
request for his resignation from the office of prosecutor general
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The upper house of parliament rejected the resignation by a
vote of 142-6 with three abstentions at a session attended by
Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin said that Yeltsin and Primakov, who met at the
Central Clinical Hospital where the president is recuperating from
a stomach ulcer, "are unanimous that unscrupulousness and
politicking are incompatible with the high post of prosecutor
general."
</P>
<P>
Skuratov, who tendered his resignation in early February, said
Wednesday that he is prepared to continue working at the post.
</P>
<P>
"I will not give up the work, if you extend your trust and
support to me," Skuratov said.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov confirmed the existence of reported compromising
material against him but insisted he had not "done anything in
breach of the law," Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Skuratov's resignation, presumably for "health reasons," was
announced by the Kremlin on February 2.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin accepted the resignation right away and sent a letter
to the Federation Council, asking them to free Skuratov from his
duties immediately.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian Constitution, the prosecutor general is
appointed and dismissed by the Federation Council on the
initiative of the President.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, or lower house of parliament, hailed the upper
house vote.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, the Prosecutor General remains in office," Duma Speaker
Gennady Seleznyov said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Municipal Services Project in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Wednesday the approval of a credit of 138.6 million U.S. dollars
for the Municipal Services Project in Bangladesh to improve
environmental and infrastructure service delivery in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The project will help strengthen the institutional capacity of
selected municipal corporations and secondary towns to provide
urban infrastructure services and improve the environmental
conditions in poor urban areas by financing critical urban
infrastructure and services, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bank, Bangladesh's urban population has been
growing rapidly at about 4.2 percent a year. Some 11 million of
the 25 million city dwellers live in poverty with monthly
household incomes of less than 75 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The social, economic, and political impacts of uncontrolled
growth and urban expansion on the urban poor are
disproportionately high. Many are unemployed and are forced to
live in squatter areas that do not receive even the most basic
services.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will finance civil works for
water supply to rehabilitate existing systems in 12
municipalities. It will also provide sanitation facilities such as
public toilets and washing facilities to be maintained by local
communities in 15 urban centers, along with a pilot small-bore
sewerage program in Khulna.
</P>
<P>
This phase of the project also covers about 220 kilometers of
roads in all participating cities and secondary towns and will
finance renovation of deteriorated roads, road paving and
widening, bridge improvements and construction of footpaths and
culverts.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credit is provided by the International
Development Association (IDA), the concessionary lending affiliate
of the World Bank Group, on standard IDA terms with 40 years to
maturity and a 10-year grace period. The government of Bangladesh
will provide 15.4 million dollars. Total project costs are 154
million dollars.

"We have resigned, and have no desire or intention of remaining

Under the Treaty, the powers of the commission in the current

We have, nonetheless, decided to exercise our powers in a

and to comply with our institutional and legal obligations, but

<HEADLINE> Arab League Warns of Israel's "Racist Ideology" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid warned on Wednesday of Israel's "racist
ideology" on security, politics and economy in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the 111th session of the AL Foreign Ministers
Council, which opened here in the day, Abdel-Meguid said the
Israeli right-wing Likud coalition attempts to eradicate Arab
presence in Palestine to establish greater Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state also intends to impose its hegemony on the
Arab world as a whole, control the Arab destiny and usurp Arab
resources, the AL chief said.
</P>
<P>
Ever since it assumed power in 1996, the Israeli government of
Benjamin Netanyahu has been working on the expansion of the
Zionist scheme by confiscating more Palestinian land, activating
the settlement drive and depriving the Palestinian people of their
rights and freedoms, Abdel-Meguid added.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the declaration of an independent state is a
legitimate right of the Palestinians, which is fully backed by the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
But he cautioned that the choice of the appropriate date for
the declaration requires more time and contacts to realize the
aspired goal and confront Israeli challenges.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid criticized Israel for freezing the Middle East
peace process, rejecting resumption of negotiations on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Iraq, Abdel-Meguid said, the Arab League will
not accept any military action or aggression on one of its member
states.
</P>
<P>
He called for an immediate halt to the aggression against Iraq
and warned against its continuation.
</P>
<P>
The Arab stance is united on the Arab solidarity with the Iraqi
people in their dilemma and the respect of Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers meet twice a year in March and
September to coordinate their countries' foreign policies and iron
out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers will discuss in the two-day meeting
a number of key issues in the Arab world, including the Mideast
peace process, the Iraqi issue, the Lockerbie crisis between Libya
and the West.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Ready to Hold Talks with Greece: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish senior official said
here Wednesday that Turkey is ready to hold talks with
neighboring Greece in a bid to solve all the problems between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foregin Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu
told reporters that the whole world should know that "we wish to
solve the disputes with neighboring Greece and we are ready to do
so."
</P>
<P>
Ankara has long accused Greece of aiding the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), but Athens has categorically denied
the accusations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish press has reported that Greek Foreign Minister Yorgo
Papandreu will pay an official visit to Turkey in April in
order to ease the worsening tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two long-time foes worsened after the
capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in Kenya in mid-February.
Ocalan was arrested by Turkish special agents when he was
leaving the residence of Greek AMbassador to Nairobi where he
had taken shelter for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
However, Logoglu said Turkey has not received any official
request from the Greek government for Papandreu's visit to Turkey
through diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> Second Iraqi Plane Lands in Saudi Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi plane carrying
around 110 pilgrims landed in Saudi Red Sea coastal city of
Jeddah Wednesday, the second batch of Iraqi pilgrims arriving in
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency quoted unnamed Saudi officials as
saying that Saudi authorities had allowed the Russian-made
Ilyushin-76 to touch down at 12:00 GMT.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the plane flew via Jordan before entering
the Saudi air space. The airliner can not cross Saudi space
directly because the U.S.-British forces enforcing the air embargo
against Iraq would force it to get back.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is still under the U.N. sanctions imposed after the
1991 Gulf war triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims will proceed by land to the Muslim holy city of
Mecca, 75 kilometers away from Jeddah, the Saudi officials said.
</P>
<P>
The first Iraqi plane carrying 110 pilgrims including Iraq's
Minister of Endowment and Religious Affairs Abdul-Munim Ahmed
Saleh landed in Jeddah Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Iraqi Airways Rabaee Mohammed Saleh said earlier
that Iraq was planning three flights to Saudi Arabia this year.
</P>
<P>
Some elderly men and women, who have found it hard to endure
the 2,000 kilometers land journey, would have chance to take the
flights, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdel-Aziz said that
Riyadh does not ban pilgrims to come to the kingdom to perform the
Hajj pilgrimage, regardless of the means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia "can not stop any pilgrim from coming to the holy
land," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq flew a civilian plane to Saudi Arabia in 1997, carrying
104 elderly and sick pilgrims to Mecca for the Hajj, a pillar of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of more than 20 million, can send up to
22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under a quota system, which limits the
number of Muslims to attend the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that about 2,000 Iraqis had arrived in the
kingdom by land Monday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Union Maintains Stance On Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Powerful Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Unions (ZCTU) Wednesday said it will not enter into social
contract negotiations with the government as long as the ban on
job stayaways imposed by President Robert Mugabe last year remains
in force.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe slapped a six-month ban on stayaways and strikes using
the Presidential Powers Regulations following threats of weekly
job stayaways by ZCTU.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU organizing Secretary James Makore said the union could not
 participate in tripartite negotiations as it would be impossible
for government to treat it as a partner while the ban was in
force, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
"Before the ban is lifted there can be no smooth relations
between the government, business and labor. We will continue to
reserve our right to participate," Makore said.
</P>
<P>
The government last year set up a tripartite forum composed of
labor, business and itself to seek solutions to economic problems
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
Makore said the union was disappointed that prices of basic
commodities continued to rise after tripartite negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Makore said employers should not take advantage of
the ban to dismiss their workers when they strike as the ban was
imposed on ZCTU only.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that some employers might take advantage of the
ignorance of workers on the ban to stop them from striking for
cost of living adjustments," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Absence in WTO Adversely Affects World: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China's continued absence from the
World Trade Organization (WTO) will adversely affect both the
international trading system at large and the members' bilateral
trading ties with China, a top WTO official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Conclusion on China's accession into the WTO will need strong
political will, determination and vision in the key capitals of
the world, said Chulsu Kim, deputy Director-General of the WTO,
when addressing a conference on "Asia and the Future of the World
Economic System."
</P>
<P>
"Although China has been far less affected by the financial
crisis in Asia than other economies, it has played a critical role
in containing the crisis," he told the conference hosted by the
British Royal Institute of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China's decision not to devalue its currency despite the
competitive pressures and her decision to maintain the momentum of
economic reforms in adverse economic conditions have earned her
greater credibility as an important and responsible participant in
the international trade and economic system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kim also noted the intensification of China's accession
negotiation in recent months, but said that "given the size and
importance of China's economy and wide-ranging trade interests
involved for a large number of WTO Members, it is not surprising
that these bilateral negotiations have also proved to be
time-consuming and complicated."
</P>
<P>
"We are now seeing a new determined push by China to conclude
its membership of the WTO as rapidly as possible," largely as a
result of China's wish to be a member of the WTO and to join the
new multilateral negotiations as a full and equal partner, he
observed, adding that similar situations occurred during the
Uruguay Round and before the establishment of the WTO in January
1995.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, this time the difference seems to be that,
along with China, WTO members also regard the months ahead as "a
window of opportunity" to bring China into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"This may spring from the conviction that failure would lead to
an indefinite delay and that China's continued absence from the
WTO would adversely affect both the international trading system
and Members' bilateral trading relationships with China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"I consider this shared perception a very positive development
because it may be just the catalyst that we need to bring about
flexibility and accommodation between China and its trading
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political inputs will be easier to make if the principal
constituents involved in the negotiations, namely the
international trading community, can agree on the terms and
conditions of China's entry, Kim said, adding that "this will also
have to be matched with the needs and requirements of China
itself."
</P>
<P>
"The balance therefore is a delicate and difficult one. An
added consideration is that the window of opportunity, though
immediate, is a short one," he said. "Herein lies the challenge.
The WTO stands to benefit substantially if this challenge is met
creatively and constructively."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accuses Serbs of ``Not Negotiating Seriously'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The spokesman of the United States
State Department James Rubin accused on Wednesday the Serb
delegation of ``not negotiation seriously'' at the peace
conference on Kosovo in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the statement on the CNN after meeting with the
president of the Kosovo Albanian delegation Hashim Thaqi and the
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hill told him the Serbs were not negotiating
seriously.
</P>
<P>
``They not only refuse to discuss the crucial problem
concerning the military aspects of implementing the agreement, but
also have re-opened a series of political questions which we think
were resolved in the last phase of the talks in Rambouillet,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the Serbian leaders of refusing to recognize
``a state of rebellion'' in Kosovo, which he said was caused by
the attacks the Serbs launched in the past few months, and said
that the situation in the field is worsening continuously.
</P>
<P>
``The Kosovars have taken a courageous decision by accepting
peace, while the Serbs are continuing to attack and kill innocent
people in Kosovo,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
He said he would invite the Kosovo Albanian leaders headed by
Thaqi, who is a member of the Kosovo Liberation Army separatist
force, to go to Washington and meet with U.S. leaders.
</P>
<P>
If the Serbs reject the peace proposal, it is up to NATO to
decide what will happen, he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks on Kosovo remained deadlocked on Wednesday as the
Serb delegation refuse to accept the military part of the peace
agreement, which calls for the deployment of up to 30,000 NATO
troops in Kosovo to guarantee the implementation of the plan of
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegation has also asked that some amendments be made
in the political part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia has called on the Serbs to adopt a
``constructive attitude'' so that an agreement can be reached at
the conference in Paris.

others funded by the business communities of Abgal clan at
Galgalato area, about five km north of capital Mogadishu on

The thunderous noise of the rocket propelled grenades,

said.

Stray rounds of the anti-aircraft machine guns have reached
Mogadishu's second largest market in Karan district and the busy
intersection of Sana.
</P>
<P>
There are no casualty figures available at the moment. However,
the noise of the heavy exchange of gunfire is getting closer and
closer to Mogadishu, an indication that Yalahow's battle wagons
are retreating from the capital to their base at the residence of
their warlord, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Unlike Yalahow, the businessmen are having more efficient
battle wagons with unlimited resources.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed fighting is not known, nevertheless,
reports close to the Abgal clan traditional elders and business
communities indicate that negotiations between the two sides in
the past three days had deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The traditional elders seemed to have accepted the logic of the
 businessmen who say that they should not pay any tax to any of
the politicians of the capital so as to defend their position of
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Yalahow, who controls the militiamen fighting against the
businessmen, has claimed that he has the right to impose taxes
which he characterized as acceptable and reasonable following his
claim of eradicating the bandits along the roads leading to the
market a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Serious fighting between the two sides has led to the closure
of Karan market for three days, claiming the lives of more than 14
 people while the wounded had exceeded 40.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition Party Petitions Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Constitutional
Assembly (NCA) of Zimbabwe Wednesday petitioned parliament to bar
the government from appointing individuals to a proposed
constitutional commission without consulting other stake-holders.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by NCA coordinator, Isaac Maposa, was being
distributed to legislators imploring them to debate and pass a
motion on the merits of instituting a commission of inquiry
without adhering to conditions the assembly set.
</P>
<P>
These conditions included that constitutional reforms process
is broad- based and has support of all stake-holders and that it
is legitimate, transparent and not dictated by one party or group.
</P>
<P>
"The government involvement must be facilitative rather than
determinative," the NCA said.
</P>
<P>
The petition came at a time when the government's chief
constitutional negotiator, Minister without Portfolio Eddison
Zvobgo, gave the NCA an ultimatum to come up with options to its
intention to appoint a commission of inquiry immediately by
Thursday or the government would go it alone.
</P>
<P>
"We urge you to seriously consider the implications of setting
up such a commission of inquiry without consulting and considering
the alternative viewpoint by the NCA and other stake-holders," the
petition read.
</P>
<P>
The assembly's view is, a national conference to agree on and
define the process of drawing up a new national constitution
should be convened at which chosen representatives of people would
draw up an appropriate legal framework for an effective and
participatory constitution-making process, the Zimbabwe News
Agency Ziana said.
</P>
<P>
That framework should be independent of the government or
ruling party influence, said the NCA.
</P>
<P>
The government has argued against this suggestion saying it
needs more time than was available before the year 2000 general
elections.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Non-Oil Exports Drop by 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's non-oil exports fell by 4
percent in the first 11 months of the current Iranian calendar
year ending March 20 on a year-to-year basis, a senior Iranian
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Export Promotion Center of Iran Mojtaba Khosrowtaj
said the non-oil exports earned the country 2.704 billion
U.S. dollars, a slight drop from the 2.820 billion in the same
period last Iranian year, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran expected to make 5 billion dollars from non-oil exports
this Iranian year, but the non-oil exports showed a negative
growth in value during the first two quarters, mainly caused by
the fall in oil prices and its by-products.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the exports shew an increase in value and
the upward trend continued in the last three months as oil price
recovered slightly.
</P>
<P>
Khosrowtaj said 1,181,569 tonnes of goods, with an estimated
value of 270 million dollars were exported in February, showing a
rise of 51 percent in weight and 32 percent in value compared with
the same month last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has taken some steps to revive the
country's non-oil exports, which have fallen since 1995 when the
then government imposed strict restrictions on the outflow of hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
In January, the Iranian cabinet decided to cede the policy-making
authority on exports to a special council in order to inject new
energy to the country's stagnant non-oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The High Council for Non-Oil Exports, instead of the cabinet,
will have the authority to make decisions on policies concerning
non-oil exports, reports said earlier.

<TEXT>

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- All the Burundi warring
factions have agreed that security should be guaranteed to the
repatriation of Burundi refugees and internally displaced people
to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Tanzanian northern town of Arusha said Wednesday that
 delegates from the just concluded 10-day committees meeting on
Burundi peace process agreed that the refugees's return should be
voluntary and organized.
</P>
<P>
Hashim Mbita, spokesman for the peace facilitator Julius
Nyerere, told a press conference that the committees insisted that
refugees should not be forced to return immediately after a final
peace agreement is reached possibly in June.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that refugees should be regularly briefed on
the ongoing peace process and be actively involved in any plans
for their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
The delegates welcomed an up-coming tripartite commission
meeting late this month by Tanzania, Burundi and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Reports say that there are about 200,000 Burundi refugee
sheltered in western Tanzania at present stage.
</P>
<P>
The committees' meeting was facilitated by Nyerere, the founding
 President of Tanzania, who urged all delegates to speed up their
work so as to reach a feasible peace agreement in the fifth round
of talks expected in June.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese School Teachers Strike for Higher Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Public high school teachers
throughout Lebanon went on an open-ended strike Wednesday to
demand better end-of-service payments.
</P>
<P>
The teachers, some of whom held a sit-in in front of the
parliament building, were demanding that end-of-service pay be
100 percent of their final salaries in the new pay scale
bill for the public sector, which was passed by the Parliament
last November.
</P>
<P>
But, the bill states that end-of-service payments will only
be calculated on 85 percent of the teachers' final salaries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the teachers held similar strikes but suspended
later in the wake of the transfer of the country's regime, which
was taken over by President Emile Lahoud.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss has set up a three-member committee
to study teachers' demands.
</P>
<P>
The strike has reportedly halted classes for some 350,000
students across the country, but those in 800 private schools are
not affected.

<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Uganda on Wednesday
signed a memorandum of understanding on boosting investment,
promoting cooperation in free trade zones and accelerating free
movement of capital.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Fawzi, chairman of Egypt's General Authority for
Investment and Free Zones, said at the signing ceremony that Egypt
and Uganda would promote reciprocal investments and set up
investment offices in both Cairo and Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The investment authorities of the two countries would supervise
the implementation of an agreement on avoidance of dual taxation,
which was signed last October, Fawzi said.
</P>
<P>
He said investment is badly needed by the two countries in the
fields of food industry, agriculture, infrastructure, health care,
tourism and power projects.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Fawzi discussed with visiting Ugandan
Industry and Trade Minister Moussa Ali ways of expanding bilateral
trade and launching more joint projects, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also covered air freight exchange, promotion of air
transport and means of encouraging private sectors to join in
bilateral economic cooperation programs and encouraging Uganda to
launch more industrial projects in Egypt's free zones.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up six free trade zones in Cairo, Ismailia, Suez,
Alexandria, Port Said and Damietta in an effort to attract foreign
investments in export-oriented industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda and Uganda have renewed
their commitment to the peaceful settlement of the seven-month
civil war rocking the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a joint
communique between the two countries said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued at the end of Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni's two-day visit to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni arrived in the Rwandan capital Kigali on Tuesday, and
has held talks with his counterpart, Pasteur Bizimungu, and
vice-president Major General Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
While reiterating their "already publicly stated legitimate
involvement" in the DRC crisis, both sides regretted that little
progress has been made because the rebels have been denied
participation in direct talks, the Rwanda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President Museveni said that Uganda sent troops to DRC to fight
Sudanese terrorism, while Bizimungu recalled that Rwanda went
there to fight the Interahamwe militia and the former government
forces.
</P>
<P>
Museveni's visit to Rwanda, the fourth since the beginning of
the year, came at a time when the rebels are steadily advancing on
several key towns in the southeast, northwest, and east of the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda also expressed concern about the conflict
tearing apart the Horn of Africa, and decided to send a joint
delegation to Ethiopia and Eritrea.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Build Dams to Supply Water to Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Addis Ababa Water and
Sewerage Authority announced Wednesday that two huge dams will be
constructed on Sivilu and Gerbi rivers at a cost of some four
billion birr (515 million U. S. dollars) to supply safe drinking
water to the Ethiopian capital and its environs.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ethiopian News Agency quoted the authority as
saying that the dam to be constructed on the Sivilu River would
enable the supply of 600,000 cubic meter water per day, which is
four times the volume being supplied to the capital by Legedadi
River.
</P>
<P>
According to the authority, the feasibility study and site
survey have been finalized while the design work is well underway.
</P>
<P>
Addis Ababa is a water shortage city and the daily water supply
is about two-thirds of the needs. The Akaki ground water project,
which will be finalized after four months, will help generate
72,000 cubic meter water every day.

Kofi Annan welcomes an agreement between Pyongyang and Washington
on U.S. access to a site at Kumchang-ri in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, his spokesman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement confirms his strong belief that a determined
diplomatic effort can resolve even the most serious issues,"
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General is particularly pleased that the two
sides have reaffirmed their commitment to the Agreed Framework of
1994, in its entirety," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He hopes that the two countries will continue to successfully
address other issues of importance, thus contributing to the
reduction of tension in the Korean Peninsula and in the region,"
Eckhard added.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and the United States announced on Tuesday that they

BONN, March 17 (Xinhua)--The world economy will grow by 2.2 per
cent in this year and 3.1 percent in year 2000, a German economy
institute predicted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kiel Institute of World Economy expected Germany's gross
domestic product (GDP) to increase by 1.6 percent, slowing down
from the 2.8 per cent growth rate in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The economy of industry countries are expected to expand by 2.1
per cent in 1999, with West Europe growing by 1.8 per cent and the
United States 3.3 per cent.
</P>
<P>
East Asian nations' GDP will grow by 4.2 per cent in 1999, and
in year 2000 will accelerate to 5.7 per cent, the institute said
in its bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Although economic downswing is threatening Germany, the
institute ruled out possibility of a recession, saying that
general conditions of German economy remain favorable, and the
monetary policy of European Central Bank (ECB) will back up the
economy better.
</P>
<P>
The jobless in Germany will be 4.04 million this year and fall

LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A leading loyalist was shot dead
in the Shankill area of west Belfast on Wednesday, according to
BBC reports from the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Frankie Curry, in his 40s, was a former member of the Red Hand
Commando loyalist group, which is still on ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Loyalist sources suggested the shooting was part of an internal
feud and not a republican revenge attack for the murder of
nationalist lawyer Rosemary Nelson on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Ulster Constable (RUC) believe three gunmen carried
out the shooting, one of whom wore a mask.
</P>
<P>
Curry's body was found behind the Pony Trotting Supporters
Sports and Social Club. He had been shot several times in the back
of the head.
</P>
<P>
Curry is known to have fallen out with the Ulster Volunteer
Force over his support for murdered Loyalist Volunteer Force
leader Billy Wright, and had to move to Portadown after his life
was threatened.
</P>
<P>
He was expelled from the Red Hand Commando for "treason", but
had recently been linked to dissident loyalist groups.

PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The bodies
of three ethnic Albanians were found early on Wednesday near a
village in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Initial examinations showed that they belonged to the three
missing brothers of Enver, Esad and Ibrahim Dervisaj from the
village of Zablace in the Istok municipality, according to the
government-run Pristina Media Center.
</P>
<P>
The information center quoted the police initial examination as
saying that the brothers, aged 16, 18 and 33, were killed by fire
weapons and their bodies showed visible traces of torture.
</P>
<P>
The family of the brothers reported two days earlier to the
local police that the brothers went missing after they had gone to
visit their relatives in Staro Dvorane, another village in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities speculated that the brothers had been
kidnapped by the separatists who had threatened the brothers for
having friendly relationship with the Serbs living in the same
area.
</P>
<P>
The brothers reportedly reported the threat to the local
police, the media center said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Works for Early Detection of Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua)--Ghana's Ministry of Health will
start recruiting and training volunteers in seven regions in the
development of a community based surveillance system which aims
at early detection and control of diseases.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Accra on Wednesday, George Amofah,
deputy director of public health, said the volunteers would
collaborate with sub- district health authorities in data
collection on diseases and report events such as unusual deaths,
the Ghana News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Other responsibility of the volunteers will be to report on
non-disease situation in addition to keeping a community register
of births and deaths.
</P>
<P>
Amofah said, "Surveillance involves data collection, analysis,
 interpretation and the action needed to contain epidemics."
</P>
<P>
 He said the program which has been piloted in the three
northern regions is being extended to the other regions and would
help in general disease control and also serve as tool to check
epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The national program is yet to take off because volunteers
would have to be trained to detect symptoms of diseases while
training manuals would also have to be developed for them.
</P>
<P>
The western, ashanti, central and greater accra regions have
already started corporating the community based surveillance
system into their plan of action on a small scale.
</P>
<P>
The program will cover a wide range of diseases since every
community or region is known to have locally endemic diseases such
as guineaworm and buruli ulcer which are common in certain parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Amofah said that non-communicable diseases such as cancer,
diabetes, hypertension and other cardio-vascular diseases, which
are not opened to community action will continue to be handled by
health institutions.
</P>
<P>
 The non communicable diseases program at the Korle Bu
Teaching Hospital aims at educating and reaching the larger public
through the formation of associations such as the Diabetes
Association of Ghana to help in the early detection and management
of these public health problems.

<HEADLINE> Legionnaire's Disease Kills 13 in Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An outbreak of Legionnaire's
disease in the Netherlands has killed 13 people so far, official
from Dutch Ministry of Health said in The Hague on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bacterial infection was traced to a flower show in
Bovenkarpsel, 40 miles north of Amsterdam. Last month, some 80,000
people visited the weeklong Westfriese Flora show. Now the Dutch
government is trying to trace visitors of the show and determine
the exact source of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch ministry official, Mr. Benno Bruggink, told Xinhua
that 200 patients have so far been reported to the ministry, 54 of
them were confirmed to have contracted Legionnaire's disease,
which is caused by the legionella bacterium. All the patients'
symptoms just look like influenza and pneumonia, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the results of the bacteriological test are not yet
known in the other 146 cases, Bruggink said. Earlier, Health
Minister Els Borst said she was deeply shocked by such an
epidemic. "We will do our utmost to ensure there is never a
recurrence of this sort of outbreak," she said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Dutch health authorities informed the World
Health Organization (WHO) of the legionella infection, as too many
people including foreign tourists visited the flower show.
</P>
<P>
Dutch experts believe that the bacteria stemmed from a fountain
which served as a centerpiece of exhibits. The disease derives
from bacteria in water.
</P>
<P>
Usually, several national flower shows are held throughout the
western Netherlands each spring, when the 6-billion-US-dollar
annual Dutch cut flower and bulb industry shows off its wares.
</P>
<P>
Bruggink confirmed that only five deaths were directly caused
by Legionnaire's disease, although eight others who had visited
the show since have died. He also said this is a very rare
disease. Last year, of the 40 ministry registered cases, 40
percent of the patients were foreigners who came to the
Netherlands as tourists, he added.
</P>
<P>
The country's National Institute of Public Health and the
Environment has started a large-scale investigation into the
source of the infection in the city of Stede Broec, part of which
belongs to Bovenkarspel. The institute has written to 5,000
visitors to the show over the age of 40, advising them to have a
urine test.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local prosecutors are considering whether criminal
charges should be brought.
</P>
<P>
Legionnaire's disease was first discovered after an outbreak at
a convention of the American Legion in Pennsylvania in 1976, when
about 180 people fell ill and 20 died of the rare disease.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria that are believed to cause the illness are found
in soil and grow in air-conditioning ducts, storage tanks and
rivers.

<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on
Wednesday called on Iran to withdraw its troops from three
disputed islands in the Gulf, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 111th Arab League Foreign
Ministers Council, UAE Foreign Minister Rashid Abdullah al-Nuaimi
said it is an illusion for Iran to keep good relations with the
Arab countries while maintaining "occupation of Arab land."
</P>
<P>
Al-Nuaimi criticized Tehran for defying the Arab will.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and Iran have been entangled in disputes over the
sovereignty of the islands of Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunb at
the mouth of the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have expressed readiness to solve the problem
through peaceful means. The UAE has proposed to determine the
sovereignty of the islands through international arbitration while
Iran insists on resolving the disputes by direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Nuaimi said his country welcomes Iran's recent political
orientation, which he termed as positive. He voiced his country's
readiness to interact with it.
</P>
<P>
However, the UAE official said Iran's orientation has been
shadowed by its occupation of Arab territories, construction of
military and civilian facilities on the islands and launching of
naval exercises in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Several hundreds of soldiers of
the National Union for the Independence of Angola (UNITA) who are
tired of endless civil war have surrendered to the government in
Benguela Province, central Angola, the Angola News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Estevao da Silva "Minguinela", senior official of the
breakaway UNITA Renovation Committee of in Benguela Province, was
quoted as saying Wednesday that the soldiers who had fled from
UNITA-controlled Ganda city in the west of the province felt they
would not go on fighting and be the victims of the war policy of
Jonas Savimbi, chairman of UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Minguinela appealed to patriotic UNITA members to "unite under
the banner of peace" and leave Savimbi and his followers
decidedly.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA Renovation Committee groups some anti-war UNITA
members who demand for the continuing of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A government source who declined to be named said the Angolan
army were frustrated recently in the UNITA-controlled central area
and forced to withdraw several dozen kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, UNITA forces have gathered a large
number of weapons in Bailundo and Andulo cities in central Angola,
where its headquarters and military strongholds are located, to
prepare for tenacious resistance.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Angolan government's repeated
accusations that Zambia had offered military support to UNITA is
not unrelated to its army's disadvantage on the central war front.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government had sent a letter to the sanction
committee of the United Nations Security Council, giving evidence
for its accusations.

<HEADLINE> Italy Hopes to Link Egypt With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy on Wednesday expressed hope
that it would be a link between Egypt and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) members.
</P>
<P>
There has been a tendency to boost cooperation between Egypt
and NATO members, visiting Italian Defense Minister Carlo
Scognamiglio told reporters after meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Terming NATO as "a defensive alliance," Scognamiglio said the
military bloc applies a new concept of expanded defense, which he
said has gone beyond Europe to regions close to Europe as well.
</P>
<P>
He called for NATO members to promote close cooperation with
Mediterranean countries in a bid to maintain regional peace,
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is a key player in helping keep peace and stability in the
Middle East and the Arab world, said the Italian minister.
</P>
<P>
Scognamiglio, who arrived here on Monday for a four-day visit,
said his ongoing trip is aimed at enhancing military ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is successful cooperation between Italy and Egypt," the
official said, adding that his country is looking forward to
further cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Italy share identical views on international and
regional issues and they have witnessed tangible progress in military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Italy joined Egypt and France in 1996 to stage naval exercises
every two years.
</P>
<P>
Italy has also pledged to support Egypt in its efforts to
remove land mines from the area of Alamein on the Mediterranean
coast under a memorandum of understanding signed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Millions of land mines placed during the World War II remain
buried in the Alamein area, posing threats to people's life and
hindering development projects in the area.

<HEADLINE> Lukashenko Denies Return of Russian Nuclear Arms to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko on Wednesday denied rumors that Russian nuclear arms
will return to his country in response to NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"There was no talk of the return of nuclear arms during
conversations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin," Interfax
quoted Lukashenko as saying at a meeting with labor
representatives in Dokshitsy, a city in Belarus' northeast Vitebsk
region.
</P>
<P>
He accused some Russian political groups and media of intending
to "use Lukashenko as a bogeyman for the West."
</P>
<P>
Certain political forces in Russia "want to frighten the West
with myself and nuclear arms," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that he had tried to dissuade Yeltsin from
the accelerated withdrawal of nuclear arms from Belarus several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the former chairman of the Belarussian Supreme
Soviet, who was then the head of state, signed a corresponding
international treaty and Belarus strictl y fulfilled its
commitments under it," he said.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Unveils Fuel Cell Compact Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- DaimlerChrysler AG, the
world's fifth largest automaker, unveiled Wednesday a
newly-developed compact car powered by fuel cells, moving one step
closer to the company's goal of selling fuel cell vehicles by
2004.
</P>
<P>
The Necar 4 (New Electric Car), based on the Mercedes-Benz
A-class compact car, can seat five people, go 450 kilometers
before refueling and travel as fast as 145 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
The car is the latest demonstration of progress on fuel cell
cars as the world's automakers continue their race to bring such
cars to the market by 2004. Fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen
into electricity to power a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Fuel cell energy generated from hydrogen is the easiest to
produce, eliminates all carbon dioxide emissions, and produces
greater efficiencies than gasoline, diesel or methanol,
DaimlerChrysler said.
</P>
<P>
"Necar 4 is a major breakthrough in fuel cell because we've
developed a very powerful fuel cell system small enough to be
packaged in a compact car," said Dr. Ferdinand Panik, head of
DaimlerChrysler's fuel cell project.
</P>
<P>
"With Necar 4, we have already proven that fuel cell technology
is viable," said Bob Eaton, chairman of DaimlerChrysler. "Now, we
are working to make the technology affordable for every consumer."
</P>
<P>
"Fuel cells have the potential to be the most attractive
alternative propulsion system for the long term," said Juergen
Schrempp, also chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
DaimlerChrysler officials said the concept car would be
replaced with Necar X, which would run on methanol. Methanol
contains hydrogen and is the auto industry's favored fuel to power
fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
But DaimlerChrysler engineers say there is still a lot of work
to be done before next year, when they aim to develop a fleet of
demonstration cars based on the Necar X.
</P>
<P>
For example, the car is 1,100 pounds heavier than an equivalent
gas-powered car because of the fuel-cell technology. Engineers say
it must be 660 pounds lighter.
</P>
<P>
The fuel cells are also 10 times too expensive, engineers say.
For example, using current technology, a mass produced fuel cell
car would cost about 30,000 U.S. dollars just for the fuel cell
hardware alone.
</P>
<P>
Other companies -- including Ford Motor, General Motors and
Honda -- also said they hope to market fuel cell vehicles by 2004.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Readjust Size of Provincial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Three provincial
legislatures would be smaller and two will gain seats after this
year's general election, the Independent Electoral Commission
(IEC) decided Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The I EC determined that the Gauteng legislature would lose 13
seats, bringing it down to 73 members.
</P>
<P>
The Western Cape legislature would have 39 members compared to
42 at present, while the North West legislature is to be cut by
one seat, leaving it with 33 members.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Cape legislature would grow from 52 to 63 members,
and that of the Northern Province from 40 to 49.
</P>
<P>
The KwaZulu-Natal legislature retained its current 80 seats.
The legislatures of the Free State, Mpumalanga, and Northern Cape
remained unchanged at 30 seats each.
</P>
<P>
The adjustments were based on the 1996 population census, said
the IEC.
</P>
<P>
The number of seats in the National Assembly would remain at
400, the IEC decided.
</P>
<P>
The IEC has rejected calls by political parties for bigger
legislatures in Gauteng, Free States and Western Cape.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Country Behind Killing of Top Shiite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq annnounced on Wednesday
that clerics from a foreign country were involved in the
asssassination of Iraq's most senior Shiite cleric Mohammed
Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader.
</P>
<P>
In a communique read on Iraq's national television, Iraqi
General Security Directorate said Iraqi security authorities
had arrested four assassins including Iraqis and clerics from a
foreign country, adding another assassin is still at large.
</P>
<P>
But he did not name the foreign country.
</P>
<P>
Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader and two of
his sons were assassinated on February 19 in Iraq's southern
province of Najaf.
</P>
<P>
In a program broadcast on Iraqi national television, Sheikh
Abdul Hassan Abbas al-Kufi, one of the assassins, confessed
he had disputes with al-Sader on moral and religious issues and
this made him get involved in the assassination of al-Sader.
</P>
<P>
Another assassin, Ahmed Mustafa Hassan al-Ardabily confessed
he worked in the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in
Tehran, Iran from 1991 until 1994.
</P>
<P>
After al-Sader's assassination, some western agencies reported
of riots in southern Iraq and clashes between Shiites and the
police. However, the Iraqi government dismissed these reports as
groundless and untrue.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader was close to the Iraqi government which appointed him
the grand ayatollah to replace the late Abul Qassim al-Khoei
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
In a move seen as an attempt to distance himself from the
government and establish him as an independent leader, Sader
issued an edict six months ago calling on the Shiites to attend
weekly Friday prayers in mosques. The secular government
disapproved of big crowds.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader enjoyed high respect among Shiites who account for about
65 percent of Iraq's 22 million people. President Saddam Hussein
and most of Iraq's senior officials belong to the minority
Sunni Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan, Rwandan Presidents Meet on Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
have concluded his two-day working visit in Rwanda and returned
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Rwanda, Museveni and his Rwandan
counterpart Pasteur Bizimungu had held talks in Kigali on regional
security and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the President's Office said Wednesday
evening that the two leaders issued a communique at the end of
Museveni's visit to the country which started on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state had reviewed the progress made so far in
the region, especially the situation in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their already publicly stated legitimate
involvement in
non-involvement of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy in the
negotiations for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reconfirmed their two countries's commitment to
the peace process and called upon the parties concerned to remove
all obstacles to that process.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Kigali, Museveni told a press conference at
Kanombe Airport that the crucial element in the conflict in the
DRC is Sudan and the Interahamwe who are in the DRC at the
invitation of that country's authorities.
</P>
<P>
On the flaring war in the Horn of Africa, they appealed to the
leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea to stop the war and seek a
peaceful solution to the conflict. They decided to send a joint
delegation to these two countries to convey their feelings and
concern.
</P>
<P>
They also reviewed progress made in various areas of bilateral
cooperation and examined ways of further strengthening that
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned over Yugoslav Troop Movements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it was "concerned" over Yugoslav troops movements
in and near Kosovo and warned NATO's patience was "growing
thin".
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very concerned about what we're seeing in
terms of military movements by Serbia. It's a matter of serious
concern to us and it's something that the Serbs have heard
directly from us about our concerns," said White House deputy
National Security Adviser James Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia on Tuesday asked a substantive changes to a
U.S.-drafted peace deal on Kosovo, which was rejected by the
so-called Contact Group that presided over the peace talks in
Paris between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have agreed to sign the peace deal and the
talks were deadlocked as the Serbs refused to let foreign troops
in their sovereign territory of Kosovo as NATO had demanded.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said NATO's patience was growing thin, and repeated
warning of bombing Yugoslav targets if Belgrade does not give up
its sovereignty in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The president has made very clear that if Serbian
intransigence and continued aggression causes this peace effort
to fail, there will be consequences, and we are watching it very
closely," Steinberg told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Central African Republic to Honor Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday called upon all political leaders of the Central African
Republic to join hand in order to promote the peace process in the
African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
15-member Security Council, Qin Huasun of China, said, "The
members of the Council expect President (Ange Felix) Patasse to
honor his commitments to implement the Bangui Agreements and the
National Reconciliation Pact, and calls on political leaders of
the Central African Republic to work jointly for the full
implementation."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the Security Council was briefed by
the special representative of the secretary-general, Oluyeme
Adeniji, on the latest developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council call on the Government, in
collaboration with all political parties, to take concrete steps
to establish the new electoral commission for the presidential
elections, and encourages the Government to continue the efforts
on restructuring its security forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the members of the Council appeal to the
international community to contribute to the Trust Fund for the
CAR (Central African Republic)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Council commend and support the efforts of
the special representative of the secretary-general and the
MINURCA (the United Nations Mission in the Central African
Republic)," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a February 18 presidential statement, the Security Council
decided unanimously to call on all political parties in the
Central African Republic to resume constructive dialogue in order
to achieve national reconciliation at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bangui Agreement, signed in January 1997, the
Government of the Central African Republic committed itself to a
number of reforms, of which the most important, concerning the
restructuring of the armed forces and the adoption of measures to
strengthen the economy, remain to be accomplished.

LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A Protestant paramilitary group,
the Red Hand Defenders, blamed a rival faction the Ulster
Volunteer Force for the killing of a hardliner in Northern Ireland
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Red Hand Defenders said Frankie Curry, a former leading
member of a Protestant "loyalist" guerrilla group, the Red Hand
Commando, was killed by the UVF and said it would "take military
action" against several leading loyalists, according to BBC
television report.
</P>
<P>
Curry was shot dead as he walked along a path in a stronghold
of pro-British Protestant loyalists.
</P>
<P>
Curry, released from prison on Monday, was said to have been
linked with dissidents, including the Red Hand Defenders, who
oppose the peace accord for the British province and ceasefires by
mainstream loyalist militias. The Red Hand Defenders were
responsible for the murdering of a prominent Catholic lawyer on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new violence would further cast shadow over the fragile
peace process in Northern Ireland which was stalled by the
decommissioning issues.

CAIRO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Qatar has announced its annual exports of liquefied
natural gas will exceed 11 million tonnes by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Minister of Energy and Industry Abdullal Bin Hamad
Al-Attiya made the remarks at a conference on petroleum and gas in
Doha, the Arabic daily Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, owning the third biggest gas reserves in the world, has
invested tens of billions of U.S. dollars to exploit the resources.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Some Gulf states which depend on crude oil for
operating their water desalination plants may have to import the
relatively cheap natural gas from Qatar, former Saudi Petroleum
Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani has said.
</P>
<P>
Yamani said Saudi Arabia consumes 275,000 barrels of petroleum
a day, and Kuwait 50,000 barrels a day, to generate electricity to
operate the water desalination plants, indicating that they may
save their valuable resources should they import Qatari gas to do
the job, the Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Nine world companies submitted offers to the Kuwaiti
Petroleum Establishment to build a factory to separate sulphur
from disel at Al Ahmadi port refinery.
</P>
<P>
According to the Alam Al Yom published Wednesday, the
construction of the new factory will cost about 125 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The factory, when in operation, can handle 70,000 barrels per
day in addition to the production of disel fuel with a low
percentage of sulphur and other aromatic components.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's imports fell to a five-year low in February
to reach 472 million dollars, the Daily Star reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive month that imports fell, with
February's imports 5 percent less than the 495 million dollars in
January.
</P>
<P>
Exports in February rose to 52 million dollars, up 11 percent
compared with January.
</P>
<P>
Italy and Saudi Arabia remained Lebanon's top supplier and
buyer of goods respectively.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Europeans to Ban Pro-Rebel TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has taken another step in
urging European countries to ban pro-Kurdish media organizations
that support the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The Foregin Ministry summoned German Ambassador Hans Joachim
Vergau and British Embassy Charge d'Affairs Hugh Mortimer to the
ministry Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said
they were summoned for urging their governments to take more
actions banning organizations such as Med TV, the daily Ozgur
Politika and the DEM news agency, which spread the propaganda of
the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has intensified efforts to have these media groups
banned, particularly following the capture of PKK leader Abdullah
Ocalan last month.
</P>
<P>
Following Ocalan's arrest, these organizations have been
encouraging Ocalan's sympathizers into carrying out bomb attacks in
Turkey, in which many innocent people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Atacanli added Turkey has long been trying to persuade the
host countries to close down the pro-Kurdish media organizations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no possibility to consider these organizations
within the framework of freedoms of press or expression," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been since 1984 fighting a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Warring Sides to Hold Peace Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior aide to Sierra Leonean
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah said Wednesday in capital Freetown
that peace talks between the government and the rebels are likely
to take place in the first or second week of April.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Wednesday quoted the aide as saying that
"the venue is almost settled now. It will most probably be Lome,
the Togolese capital."
</P>
<P>
The presidential aide said that Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) leader Foday Sankoh who is being imprisoned in the capital
Freetown, instructed his field commanders by radio at the weekend
set up a team to meet him.
</P>
<P>
The team to be formed by Sankoh's military commander Sam
Bockarie will leave Sierra Leone for a third country in a week or
two, where the team will harmonize their position for forthcoming
negotiations with the government, the aide confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"One of the main problems left is for the RUF delegation to
meet with their leader and sort out their act to be able to
negotiate realistically," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leaders will meet either in Lome of Togo or Abidjan
of Cote d'Ivoire before the peace talks start, the aide added.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah and his aides say the United States has been pushing the
latest peace talks and has offered to fly rebel commanders to a
third country.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats in Freetown said that both the Sierra Leonean
government and the rebels face intense foreign pressure to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who took up arms in 1991 and has since been fighting
successive governments, was sentenced to death last October over
the charge of treason.
</P>
<P>
A military junta overthrew the democratically-elected Kabbah
government in 1997 but the west African peacekeeping force known
as ECOMOG reinstated him in March 1998.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
has said the Palestinian people has the right to declare an
independent state on May 4 when the interim period of Palestinian
self-rule stipulated in the Oslo Accords expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks Wednesday evening in Gaza in meeting
Liu Zhihai, Chinese representative to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
To move the peace process forward and continue peace talks with
Israel are the strategic options of the Palestinian people and the
Palestinian National Authority will continue to do so, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Mideast peace talks have entered a
stalemate again while all signed agreements between the
Palestinians and Israel have not been implemented properly.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side is not responsible for that, Arafat
stressed.
</P>
<P>
China is an important country in maintaining the world peace
and in supporting justice, and the Palestinian people will never
forget the great support the Chinese government and people
rendered to them.
</P>
<P>
China is not a country seeking self-interest in the Mideast and
the Palestinian people believe that China will continue to play a
great role in moving the Mideast peace process forward, Arafat
said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Liu said that China will cherish its friendly
relationship with the Palestinian people and will continue to make
contributions to the peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> ARATS President Plans Taiwan Visit For This Autumn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIPEI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) have agreed in principle on ARATS President Wang
Daohan's visit to Taiwan this autumn.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached today in Taipei by ARATS Deputy
Secretary General Li Yafei and SEF Deputy Secretary General Jan
Jyh-horng, who agreed that Wang and his wife will have a five or
six day visit.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, Li told a press conference that they
discussed implementation of the four-point consensus reached by
Wang Daohan and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu last autumn in Shanghai.
He said that he is here to prepare for Wang's visit and to lay a
foundation for discussions of details of the visit.
</P>
<P>
Li explained that Wang's visit is a continuation of the high-
level ARATS and SEF dialogue on political and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that they have heard SEF's suggestions on Wang's visit
and will report them to the ARATS chairman and that ARATS will
study them carefully and discuss them with SEF on the next visit.
</P>
<P>
ARATS also confirmed its invitation of Jan to the mainland and
said it is willing to invite SEF Vice-Chairman Shi Hwei-yow to the
mainland in June. During these visits, he said, they can make
arrangement for further exchanges of views on Wang's Taiwan visit.
</P>
<P>
Jan said that this is the first time for the two to sit down
face-to-face to discuss Wang's Taiwan visit and that this is
itself successful because they can understand each other's point
of view, which is helpful for further discussions.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between Li and Jan, SEF Vice-Chairman Shi
Hwei-yow had a protocol meeting with Li Yafei.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise Only 0.1 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices rose just 0.1
percent in February despite a bigger increase in meat, oranges and
airline fares, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive monthly rise of that tiny
magnitude in the Consumer Price Index, the Department said. And it
left the seasonally adjusted inflation rate for the first two
months of the year at just 1.1 percent, compared with a 12-year
low of 1.6 percent for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report confirms anecdotal evidence, released Wednesday in
the Federal Reserve's survey of regional economic conditions,
showing "prices of most goods remained little changed" so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this means the Fed's monetary policy-makers
probably will feel comfortable leaving short-term interest rates
unchanged when they meet next on March 30.
</P>
<P>
After the figures were released, yields on long-term government
bonds fell to 5.48 percent from 5.50 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said energy costs last month were unchanged, with
declines of 1.4 percent for fuel oil and 0.5 percent for gasoline
offsetting increases of 0.6 percent for electricity and 0.1
percent for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, food prices surged only 0.1 percent after a
substantial 0.5 percent increase in January. Fruit costs were up
0.6 percent with oranges jumping 5.3 percent on top of a 24.1
percent gain in January. Largely due to a December freeze in
California's Central Valley, oranges were 48 percent more
expensive than a year earlier. Beef rose 1.3 percent, the most in
six years, and pork, 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components edged
up 0.1 percent in February. Airline fares jumped 2.4 percent,
hospital services rose 0.5 percent and textbook and school
supplies, 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, clothing and cars,which heavily influenced by
competition from imports, fell 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent
respectively. Computer prices declined 2.8 percent and were 34.6
percent lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Also, tobacco costs declined 1.4 percent but were still 33.5
percent higher than a year earlier, reflecting tobacco companies'
efforts to recoup the cost of multimillion-dollar liability
settlements.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says U.S. ABM Bill Hinders START Treaties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry said
Thursday that the bill passed by the U.S. Senate on the deployment
of a national anti-missile system undermines a whole series of
previously made agreements.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of such a system sets "a course for undermining
the 1972 ABM Treaty and the entire set of START agreements," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The ABM Treaty bans the deployment of such a system," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move "seriously jeopardizes the overall process of
curbing nuclear arms and strategic stability, for the sake of
which major international agreements have been drafted for
decades," the Interfax news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the U.S. Senate bill "urges the U.S.
Administration to elevate the creation of the nation-wide
anti-missile system to the level of national policy. It calls for
beginning deployment as early as is technically possible."
</P>
<P>
"Although Washington stresses that a decision on the system
will not be made before 2000, the very direction of the Senate's
actions cripple" the existing agreements in this sphere, the
statement said, adding that the ABM nd START agreements "are two
parts of the same thing."
</P>
<P>
The fact that a "possible reduction of strategic offensive
weapons depends on the execution of this treaty is stipulated in
the ABM, the START I and START II treaties," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Stresses Increase of Trade With Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan
William B. Milam stressed here Thursday that Pak-U.S. bilateral
trade should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Private sectors in the two countries should accelerate their
efforts for promoting two-way trade, the U.S. envoy said during
his visit to the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Interaction between the business communities should be
increased through exchange of delegations and participation in
trade fairs and exhibitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Baser Daud, president of Islamabad Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (ICCI), said that trade volume between Pakistan and
the United States at present was about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the bilateral trade should be increased
through more active interaction between businessmen of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the single most important problem standing in the
way of revival of Pakistan's economy is the enormous foreign and
domestic debts which are consuming up to 95 percent of Pakistan's
GDP for debt-servicing.
</P>
<P>
Daud urged the United States to help Pakistan's economy by
writing off Pakistan's external debts as was done by it in favor
of Egypt.

<HEADLINE> EU Gives Green Light to S. Korean Firms' Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here on Thursday that it has given the green light to two South
Korean companies for their merger.
</P>
<P>
The merger refers to the acquisition of Kia by Hyundai. Both
South Korean companies manufacture and sell motor vehicles
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the merger will have only a limited affect
on the European Union (EU) market.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) has acquired control of the whole
Kia Motors Corporation (KMC). As a result, the transaction
constitutes a concentration under the EU Merger Law, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
This transaction affects the EU passenger car sector as well as
those of vans under 3.5 tons and small buses.
</P>
<P>
The combined EU market for passenger cars of HMC and KMC is 1.3
percent, with exception for Greece, where the two South Korean
firms have 16 percent of the medium car share, according to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Noting that HMC has a 9.6 percent share on the EU sport coupe
market with shares exceeding 40 percent in Greece and Spain, the
commission pointed out that the two firms' vans under 3.5 tons do
not exceed 2 percent of the average market share even though their
share in the Netherlands is 11.3 percent, and their small bus
market represents 0.2 percent in EU, with 2.3 percent in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the concentration is compatible with the EU
common market.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive commission resigned on Tuesday, but could not
leave its job until the EU member state governments appoint a new
team to replace it under the EU Treaty. The outgoing EU executive
body is still handling its day-to-day business, including
proposing and implementing laws.

<P>
LAUSANNE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) released here today its Interim Report for the 27
th Olympiad (1997-2000) during the IOC 108th session.
</P>
<P>
"We have always made our television and sponsorship contracts
and financial terms available to the general public," said IOC
President Juan Samaranch. "However, we recognize we need to be
more aggressive in releasing these reports to the public."
</P>
<P>
To further show transparency of its work, the IOC also made the
financial report available on its website, www.olympic.org.
</P>
<P>
The final report for this period will be issued at the end of
the Olympiad in late 2000, after the Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The biannual report, an initiative that responds to the call
for additional transparency of the IOC, presents a comprehensive
financial overview to demonstrate the full extent of the IOC's
commitment to sport.
</P>
<P>
Like the annual IOC Finance Statements, the Interim Report is
in line with international accounting standards and is audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers. The auditor's report, together with the
detailed financial statements, were submitted to the IOC's
Executive Board and to the Session for approval.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Sector Progressing in Addressing Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese financial
official said here Thursday that China's financial sector has been
progressing greatly in addressing the Y2K problem and is confident
to ensure a smooth and successful transition into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jing, director general of the Payment System and
Technology Department of the People's Bank of China (PBC), made
the point to the Global 2000 Coordinating Group meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he pointed out, the efforts and progress have not
been made known to international financial sectors and other
relevant areas due to lack of information dissemination about
them.
</P>
<P>
Chen said, "We have the highest level commitment and focus from
both the Chinese government and the financial sector to solve the
Y2K problem."
</P>
<P>
The State Council of China issued directives last August
identifying it as the key industry to solve the Y2K problem, and
the PBC, the central bank, called a meeting of the presidents from
all the banks to map out a framework for solving the Y2K problem
in the financial sector, making clear that the president of each
bank is personally responsible for solving the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
A Finance Industry Year 2000 IT Project Office has been set up
to provide leadership for the financial sector in this regard and
all the commercial banks and policy banks have set up their own
offices alike, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PBC has also issued Year 2000 Testing Guidelines, laying
out both the recommended schedule and standards for the Y2K
compliance testing, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the current status in practical work, Chen said the PBC and
the commercial banks as well as policy banks have completed
hardware upgrading and nearly all system and application software
has been modified and put in place.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the whole sector is in a stage for further system
upgrading, internal and interbank testing and contingency plan
formulating.
</P>
<P>
According to established plans, he said, all financial
institutions must complete all the internal test of application
systems as well as interbank testing of critical systems by May
and finalize formulation and testing of contingency plans at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
External and online testing will be completed by September,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Taking the case at PBC, Chen said modification of the 22
centrally developed application systems have been close to
completion, acceptance criteria and contingency plan are being
finalized and over 90 percent of its local branches have finished
preliminary testing plans.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Y2K readiness of the major business systems at
PBC, Chen said all the critical systems, including the Electronic
Interbank System, the Local Clearing House Systems, the Central
Bank Accounting System, the Foreign Exchange Transaction System
and RMB Interbank Loan System , the Bond Settlement System ,
Information Management System for Treasury, Currency Issue,
Statistics and Foreign Exchange will totally become Y2K compliant
by May.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning China's five commercial banks which handle a wide
range of business and have a lot of complex applications, Chen
said they are now focusing on system testing, acceptance and
contingency planning and their external and online testing will
also be finished by September.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hungary Imposes Fuel Tax on Vehicles Making Multi-entries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Hungary Wednesday began to
impose fuel tax on vehicles entering the country more than once a
day, as a means to crack down on fuel smuggling from neighboring
countries, where gasoline is cheaper, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Smugglers used to fill the tank of their vehicles with oil in
Ukraine, Romania or other neighboring countries, and then drove
into Hungary, where gasoline and diesel oil are under government
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
Smuggled fuel was usually sold to small gas stations and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Investigation shows that before the tax imposition, one-third
of the 6,000 to 6,500 vehicles entering Hungary everyday smuggled
fuel more than once a day.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, about 130,000 liters of fuel was smuggled into the
country yearly, causing financial loss of 60 billion forints (261
million U.S. dollars) to the government.

<P>
KIEV, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ukrainian official Thursday
rejected the allegation that Ukraine will soon become a member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), describing it as a
"provocation."
</P>
<P>
The rumor had been concocted to mislead Ukraine's balance-
oriented diplomatic policy, Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of the
Ukrainian Committee on Security and Defense, said at a symposium
here on NATO.
</P>
<P>
He quoted President Leonid Danilovich Kuchma as saying that at
present it is too early for Ukraine to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbulin noted that Ukraine, under the United Nations
Charter, has the right to become a member of any military or
political organization though it has not yet presented an official
application for NATO membership so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on NATO to take into consideration the
interests and concerns of all European countries in its expansion
process, saying that Ukraine supports the establishment of a new
European security system.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Thursday said the African countries should pay attention to
education.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this at the opening ceremony of the two-day African
 education ministers conference in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The conference's objectives are to examine developments in
education in Africa and to chart future courses of action.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed a revised agenda on education in Africa
should guide African countries in achieving education for all.
</P>
<P>
He said that major challenges facing African education systems
include access to education, relevance and effectiveness of
education, complimentary learning modalities, and capacity
building.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), almost a billion people will enter the 21st Century
unable to read or write, almost two-thirds of whom will be women.
</P>
<P>
Of the people who will be illiterate, more than 130 million are
of school-going age and are in the developing world, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft program of action of decade of education,
Africa now faces a literacy rate of as low as 40 percent and over
200 million illiterate adults.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said: "Poverty, ignorance, hunger and disease have
remained our major problems which must be vigorously tackled by
all of us."
</P>
<P>
"Through education, we can spur our peoples to become full
citizens and social actors in the global village," he said. "We
should thus strive to overcome problems associated with falling
enrolment ratios, low completion and high drop-out rates as well
as irrelevant curricula so that our peoples can be prepared to
enjoy full social and economic lives.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "We fully realize that learning for life in the
21st Century will require that children or learners be equipped
not only with a basic education in literacy and numeracy but also
with more advanced and complex skills for living that serve as the
foundation for life."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The annual trade value of the
Tehran Stock Exchange reached more than 3,170 billion rials
(about one billion U.S. dollars), up by 57.13 percent during the
current Iranian calendar year to end on Saturday from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,210,940,429 shares of industrial and production
units changed hands in the year, up by 117.73 percent from last
Iranian year, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The share price index on the last working day of the year stood
at 1537.96 points, down 115.10 points from that of the last year.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices slump in the world market also hit the Tehran
Stock Exchange during the year. However, oil market recovery in
the past few days injected more vitality to stock trading in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Some economists predicted that stock market would be more
active in the Iranian new year following the agreement recently
reached by some oil producers to cut down their output in a bid to
shore up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian government has announced to privatize
190 state companies through the Tehran Stock Exchange in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Stock Exchange opened in April 1968 with trading only
on government bonds and certain state-backed certificates. It was
shut down following the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The stock market resumed activities in 1989 due to a
privatization drive of state-owned enterprises and promotion of
economic activities of the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that more than 200 companies have gone on the
Tehran Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft's Chinese Version Of New Web Browser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest software
provider, Microsoft, released the Chinese version of its Internet
Explorer 5.0 today.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft is scheduled to release versions in 9 languages today
but because of time difference, the IE 5.0 is being made available
in China earlier than in the US.
</P>
<P>
The IE 5.0 will make interaction with the Internet quicker and
more convenient and it is easier for professionals to develop,
deploy and manage, according to Julia Wu, general manager of
Microsoft (China) Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
However, the IE 5.0 seems less powerful to some than its
predecessor the IE 4.0, which was released in Sep. 1998. But, Wu
says, the new browser may not be a revolution, but it will be a
popular product. The IE 5.0 is 20-25 percent faster than the IE 4.
0 and 75 percent faster than its rival the Navigator 4.5.
</P>
<P>
The new browser allows a computer to be used for real-time
radio or television reception from the Internet. It contains the
Windows Media Players and can be applied to VCDs, which might make
it popular in China, the world's largest VCD market.
</P>
<P>
The new IE also allows users to choose from the nine search
options like Yahoo and Excite. And, it can be downloaded from the
Internet or purchased through traditional channels and is smaller
than the 4.0 version. The IE 5.0 has 6.5 megabytes, but the 4.0
has 12 megabytes so downloading time is shorter.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Microsoft's Chinese language Website, Internet
users can download IE 5.0 from 13 Chinese Internet service
providers and Internet content providers.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Days after Israel exchanged
words with the European Union over the status of Jerusalem,
dozens of foreign diplomats, most of them from European
countries, Thursday met with a senior Palestinian official in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the Oriental House in east Jerusalem,
which is serving as a representative office of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from France, Holland and other European countries
met with PNA Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal al-Husseini.
Other diplomats from Canada, Jordan and South Africa also took
part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, al-Husseini told reporters that the PNA
rejected Israel's position on the status of Jerusalem. He noted
that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinians in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
Al-Husseini stressed that Israel could not determine the fate of
Jerusalem without taking into account the Muslim and Christian
residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the foreign diplomats will continue to visit
the Oriental House despite Israel's rejection.
</P>
<P>
Last week, German, currently holding the E.U. presidency, sent a
letter to Israeli Foreign Ministry reconfirming the EU's support
for the internationalization of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel and any attempt to
undermine Israel's position on the issue will be rejected outright.
</P>
<P>
Israel also demanded the foreign diplomats refrain from
visiting the Oriental House and meeting with Palestinian officials
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war and later annexed it. The Palestinians want to
establish an independent nation with east Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
Under peace agreements signed by the two sides, the status of
Jerusalem should be settled in the final status talks.

<HEADLINE> IOC Approves Reform for 2006 Bid City Selection Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) approved the 2006 bid city selection process
reform proposal at its 108th session here today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, submitted by Judge Keba Mbaye of Senegal, was
unanimously approved with one abstention, said the IOC in its
press release.
</P>
<P>
"The action taken today continues to demonstrate our strong
commitment to reform," IOC President Juan Samaranch was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"This interim process will eliminate further opportunities for
impropriety in the future and get the IOC back in the business of
managing the process of the Olympic Games," he added.
</P>
<P>
The reform calls for the creation of an election college
comprised of: the IOC president, IOC Doyen Jean Marie Faustin
Godefroid Havelange of Brazil, eight additional IOC members, the
chairman of the Evaluation Commission, a representative of the
winter sports international federations, a national Olympic
committee representative, and three athletes elected by the
athletes at the 18th Olympic Winter Games in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Non-eligible participants include nationals of a country
involved in one of the candidate cities or members of the IOC
Executive Board, except the IOC president and the chairman of the
Evaluation Commission.
</P>
<P>
Visits by IOC members to bid cities are strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The reform applies only to the 2006 bid city selection process
while the IOC awaits recommendations from the IOC 2000 Commission,
which was announced as part of the sweeping reform being made by
the IOC this week in Lansanne.
</P>
<P>
The six bid cities on the 2006 Winter Games include Helsinki of
Finland, Klagenfurt of Austria, Poprad-Tatry of Slovakia, Sion of
Switzerland, Turin of Italy, and Zakopane of Poland.
</P>
<P>
All six candidates will make their presentations to the 109th
session on June 18, 1999 in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The election and appointment of the members of the college will
take place on the morning of June 19 and that college will
deliberate and choose two finalist cities to be voted on by the
full IOC. The announcement of the host city of the 20th Olympic
Winter Games in 2006 will be June 19.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues Between Ethiopia, Eritrea: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting between Ethiopia
and Eritrea was going on at Mereb-Setit near Badme, a senior
Eritrean foreign ministry official confirmed Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamariam Tekeste, head of the Afro-asia and Australia
Department of the ministry, told Xinhua in a telephone interview
that by 9:00 p.m. local time Wednesday, Eritrea had destroyed four
Ethiopian tanks, captured one other and destroyed three vehicles
armed with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that as it had done at Tsorona wing of the
Alitiena- mereb front, the Ethiopian troops this time suffered an
"uncountable" human loss.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea claimed earlier that in the three-day Tsorona fighting,
Ethiopia suffered the "biggest defeat", with 57 tanks destroyed
and six others captured, one mig-23 plane shot down and a heavy
human loss.
</P>
<P>
He said however that he did not receive any update report
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the fighting starting from Tuesday went
on for the whole day wednesday and it took place "deep inside
Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian government accused Eritrea of waging a
 propaganda campaign, although "many" Eritreans died in the
fighting in the central Tsorona front, but Addis Ababa gave no
details of the fighting itself.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea said Friday it was willing to withdraw from all
contested zones, but only under a general demilitarization of the
frontier as envisaged in the OAU plan, which implies that both
sides must pull back.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which bases its position on Italian colonial-era
treaties and maps, accused Ethiopia of sparking border conflict by
occupying part of the Bada region on the eastern front in July
1997, and publishing "an illegal map" the same year which included
Eritrean territory in Ethiopian's northern Tigray region.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia claims that Eritrea continues to occupy "Ethiopian
territory in the regions of Zala Anbesa-Aiga and Egala (central
front) and Bada-Burie (eastern front).
</P>
<P>
The border war between the two horn of Africa neighbors broke
out last May and resumed in February after seven months of lull.
</P>
<P>
The war has continued despite that both sides have accepted the
 framework agreement put forward by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrea has called for a cease-fire and mutual
redeployment of troops while Ethiopia demands Eritrea should
withdraw from all the " occupied" land.

ASMARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting between Ethiopia
and Eritrea was going on at Mereb-Setit near Badme, a senior
Eritrean foreign ministry official confirmed Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tesfamariam Tekeste, head of the Afro-asia and Australia
Department of the ministry, told Xinhua in a telephone interview
that by 9:00 p.m. local time Wednesday, Eritrea had destroyed four
Ethiopian tanks, captured one other and destroyed three vehicles
armed with machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that as it had done at Tsorona wing of the
Alitiena- mereb front, the Ethiopian troops this time suffered an
"uncountable" human loss.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea claimed earlier that in the three-day Tsorona fighting,
Ethiopia suffered the "biggest defeat", with 57 tanks destroyed
and six others captured, one mig-23 plane shot down and a heavy
human loss.
</P>
<P>
He said however that he did not receive any update report
Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the fighting starting from Tuesday went
on for the whole day wednesday and it took place "deep inside
Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian government accused Eritrea of waging a
 propaganda campaign, although "many" Eritreans died in the
fighting in the central Tsorona front, but Addis Ababa gave no
details of the fighting itself.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea said Friday it was willing to withdraw from all
contested zones, but only under a general demilitarization of the
frontier as envisaged in the OAU plan, which implies that both
sides must pull back.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea, which bases its position on Italian colonial-era
treaties and maps, accused Ethiopia of sparking border conflict by
occupying part of the Bada region on the eastern front in July
1997, and publishing "an illegal map" the same year which included
Eritrean territory in Ethiopian's northern Tigray region.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia claims that Eritrea continues to occupy "Ethiopian
territory in the regions of Zala Anbesa-Aiga and Egala (central
front) and Bada-Burie (eastern front).
</P>
<P>
The border war between the two horn of Africa neighbors broke
out last May and resumed in February after seven months of lull.
</P>
<P>
The war has continued despite that both sides have accepted the
 framework agreement put forward by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
However, Eritrea has called for a cease-fire and mutual
redeployment of troops while Ethiopia demands Eritrea should
withdraw from all the " occupied" land.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Reports on Possible Partition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Thursday denied reports
that it has agreed to let its southern states break away from the
north.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 111th session of
the Arab League Council held here, Sudanese Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Ali Abdel Rahman Numeiri dismissed the reports as
"bare of truth."
</P>
<P>
Numeiri denounced the reports as "outside attempts" aimed at
splitting his country.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the Sudanese government was
considering a partition of the country into a Muslim north and a
Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese rebel groups have been fighting for greater autonomy
in the south in a 16-year civil war. Peace talks between the
government and the rebel groups have so far yield no tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is now seeking to "put its own house in order" and to
close ranks in an effort to "confront outside attempts" to
dismember the country, Numeiri said.
</P>
<P>
"In Sudan, we are in agreement on the settlement of the south
issue through a political dialog. Results will be presented at a
national referendum within the framework of a unified Sudan," he
added.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Meet on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference of the
African education ministers started in Harare Thursday, examining
developments in education in Africa and charting future courses of
action.
</P>
<P>
Before the conference, the three-day experts meeting ended
Wednesday with a lot of recommendations on the development of
African education.
</P>
<P>
more than 120 education ministers and experts from 52 member
states of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) attended the
conference. The ministers are expected to discuss and adopt the
Final Report on education in Africa, recommendations and Program
of Action of the Decade.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Deputy Director-General of UNESCO
Colin Power said the ministers are about to approve and adopt the
Draft program of Action of the Decade of Education in Africa, and
this should be read as a sign of our continuing collaboration with
the African continent in the ever so crucial sector of education.
It is regarded as a positive contribution to attainment of the
endeavors of the African people on this threshold to the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
He said that the specific objectives of the conference were to
"examine developments in education in Africa since the beginning
of the 1999's and to chart future courses of action, within the
context of the OAU' Decade of Education in Africa (1997-2006) and
the United Nations Special Initiative for Africa."
</P>
<P>
Apart from establishing or strengthening adequately funded
pan-African mechanisms, Power said, the OAU Decade emphasizes
objectives of vital importance to UNESCO, namely: The need to
provide access to basic education to all, particularly to girls
and children of disadvantaged groups; The highest priority given
to the role, status and training of teachers; Quality education
obtained through adequate learning materials and assurance of
minimum levels of nutrition and an enlightened language policy;
The inclusion of basic skills such as dealing with HIV/AIDS,
drugs, human rights and preparation for the world of work and the
fundamental recasting of institutions of higher learning and
research.
</P>
<P>
The progress registered in literacy and in both primary and
secondary education enrolments during the 1960s stagnated and
receded during the 1980s, in face of the general deterioration of
social, political and economic conditions of most countries in the
African continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The dominant trend in the education sector was that of lack of
infrastructure, low participation rates, disparities in access and
general limitation of resources for recurrent and capital
expenditure, said Power.
</P>
<P>
Most African governments are making great efforts to allocate
more resources to the education sector. Most African countries
have designated national coordinators, the UNESCO official said.
</P>
<P>
He wished to restate UNESCO's enthusiastic support for the
Decade for Education in Africa.

<HEADLINE> WTO Hits Canada on Dairy Export Pricing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
has outlawed a Canadian trade policy, zeroing on exports of
Canadian dairy products such as ice cream and cheese.
</P>
<P>
Canada's system of pricing its dairy exports at lower rates
than its domestic milk is classified as an illegal export subsidy
and must be fixed, the WTO ruled on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ruling affects between 33 million to 66 million U.S.
dollars in Canada's dairy exports, or half of the total.
</P>
<P>
The WTO also condemned Canada's system of limiting milk imports
to the bags of groceries that consumers bring across the border.
</P>
<P>
The dairy ruling stems from a challenge from the United States
and New Zealand. The two countries criticized parts of the ruling
as an export subsidy, an accusation Ottawa denies.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian federal government says it will talk to the
provinces and industry to see if it should appeal.
</P>
<P>
"The (WTO) report deals only with some dairy exports and has no
effect on Canada's domestic supply management system," Canadian
Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is committed to supply management and will continue to
defend its dairy industry," added the minister.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Strives to Eliminate Illiteracy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government is trying
to eliminate illiteracy in the country so that every child can go
to school, Minister of Education Osman Saleh said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Education is one of the factors for the development of the
country. It is central to producing skilled human resources,"
Osman told Xinhua in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
He said some 65 percent of the 3.5 million people in the horn
of Africa country are still illiterate, and that only 52 percent
of school-aged children have the chance to go to school.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the Eritrean government is making
every effort to provide equity education, or equitable access to
education, to the whole population especially children, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government has set up more than 250 schools across
the country since independence in 1993, Osman said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are a total of 741 schools with 385,000
students, from elementary schools to junior and senior secondary
schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
Every year, Eritrean schools enroll some 35,000 to 40,000
children, and accordingly, 30 to 50 new schools are established,
he added.
</P>
<P>
In elementary schools, pupils are taught in eight different
ethnic languages, which makes people happy and willing to receive
education, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Osman acknowledged that Eritrea is short of teachers in junior
schools. There are 7,800 teachers nationwide but the junior
secondary schools are still understaffed.
</P>
<P>
Usually, teachers in the secondary schools are staffed by
graduates from Eritrea's only two higher education institutions,
the University of Asmara and the Teachers Training Institute, both
of whom are located in the capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
Each year some 400 to 600 students are graduated from these two
higher learning institutions. Those with degrees can teach in
senior secondary schools while others with diplomas can be
teachers in junior secondary schools, said the minster.
</P>
<P>
In fact, teachers are quite well paid -- for graduates from the
higher education institutions, the standard monthly wage is
equivalent to 225 U.S. dollars, Osman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In order to overcome the staff shortage problem in junior
secondary schools, the government plans to set up one more
teachers training institute in the central Keren Province this
year. Several people have been sent to Europe and South Africa to
study for postgraduate degrees so that they could teach in the new
institute, which needs 35 teachers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Students graduated from this institute will be teachers in
basic education, the elementary schools and the junior secondary
schools, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the human resources, the Eritrean government
also provides "big " financial and material support for education,
the minister said, but he did not give the specific figure.
</P>
<P>
Osman also said that dropouts only account for eight percent of
the students in his country. In capital Asmara, 51 percent of the
students are girls while nationally 43 percent of students are
girls.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that his government pays much attention to
the idea of "from theory to practice," organizing all high school
students to spend 45 days in summer doing any kind of work, such
as afforestation and road construction.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the on-going conflict, the minister said that it
has little effect on schools, though it does affect the schools in
the border areas and affect the mentality of the parents.

<HEADLINE> 132 Million People Above Age 60 In China Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua)-- China will have 132 million
people above the age of 60, or 10 percent of the population next
year, according to Yuan Xinli, vice-president of the China
National Committee on Aging.
</P>
<P>
Yuan told a press conference today that, by the end of last
year, China had 120 million people above 60, or 9.7 percent of the
population. China has half of Asia's elderly and a fifth of the
world's.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to have 280 million elderly by 2025, who will
account for 18.46 percent of its population. Yuan says that this
aging population means a growing need for businesses that cater to
the special needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
They will become a promising economic growth point and provide
ample room for Chinese and overseas businesses to use this
potential, he says. Shanghai is the first Chinese city with an
aging population, with 13 million people aged 60 or older,
accounting for 18 percent of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held to announce an international
welfare products fair to be held here October 3-6. The 6,000-sqare-
meter fair will attract companies producing medical equipment,
rehabilitation facilities, recreation and entertainment equipment,
and food and clothing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies, schools, travel agencies, and retirement
home representatives will also participate.

<HEADLINE> ADB Not to Provide Loans to India Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Resident representative of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) Frank J. Polman said here Thursday
that the bank could not provide 1.3 billion U.S. dollars loans to
India at the moment for its power sector.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters, he said that the loans have been affected
due to the sanctions imposed on India after it conducted nuclear
tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"The loans will go through only after the sanctions on India
are lifted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Economic and technical feasibility reports on five loan
proposals aggregating about 1.3 billion dollars had been completed
and were in different phases of preparations with some almost
ready to go. The Board of Directors of ADB, however, will have to
approve the loans only after the sanctions were lifted, he further
said.
</P>
<P>
The existing loans were not affected, he added.
</P>
<P>
The five loan proposals are slated for disbursement in the next
three years.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Meets Foreign Diplomats in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Days after Israel exchanged
words with the European Union over the status of Jerusalem,
dozens of foreign diplomats, most of them from European
countries, Thursday met with a senior Palestinian official in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held in the Oriental House in east Jerusalem,
which is serving as a representative office of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from France, Holland and other European countries
met with PNA Minister for Jerusalem Affairs Faisal al-Husseini.
Other diplomats from Canada, Jordan and South Africa also took
part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, al-Husseini told reporters that the PNA
rejected Israel's position on the status of Jerusalem. He noted
that Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinians in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
Al-Husseini stressed that Israel could not determine the fate of
Jerusalem without taking into account the Muslim and Christian
residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the foreign diplomats will continue to visit
the Oriental House despite Israel's rejection.
</P>
<P>
Last week, German, currently holding the E.U. presidency, sent a
letter to Israeli Foreign Ministry reconfirming the EU's support
for the internationalization of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel and any attempt to
undermine Israel's position on the issue will be rejected outright.
</P>
<P>
Israel also demanded the foreign diplomats refrain from
visiting the Oriental House and meeting with Palestinian officials
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the east Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war and later annexed it. The Palestinians want to
establish an independent nation with east Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
Under peace agreements signed by the two sides, the status of
Jerusalem should be settled in the final status talks.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Reports on Possible Partition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Sudan on Thursday denied reports
that it has agreed to let its southern states break away from the
north.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the 111th session of
the Arab League Council held here, Sudanese Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Ali Abdel Rahman Numeiri dismissed the reports as
"bare of truth."
</P>
<P>
Numeiri denounced the reports as "outside attempts" aimed at
splitting his country.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the Sudanese government was
considering a partition of the country into a Muslim north and a
Christian and animist south.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese rebel groups have been fighting for greater autonomy
in the south in a 16-year civil war. Peace talks between the
government and the rebel groups have so far yield no tangible
results.
</P>
<P>
Sudan is now seeking to "put its own house in order" and to
close ranks in an effort to "confront outside attempts" to
dismember the country, Numeiri said.
</P>
<P>
"In Sudan, we are in agreement on the settlement of the south
issue through a political dialog. Results will be presented at a
national referendum within the framework of a unified Sudan," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Sea Level Rise Along Bay of Bengal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Experts on climate and environment
Thursday warned that 8.6 percent of the land on the coast of Bay
of Bengal would be totally submerged while 66.6 percent low-lying
area across Bangladesh is likely to become vulnerable if sea level
registers one meter rise due to global warming and green-house
effects.
</P>
<P>
At least 75 percent of the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove in
the world, situated in southwestern Bangladesh, might be lost if
the sea registers one meter rise and if the sea rises two meters
even parts of the capital Dhaka will be inundated, one expert
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
They expressed the view at an international seminar on "Sea
Level Rise and Sustainable Coastal Management", which is jointly
organized by the University of Asia-Pacific (Dhaka) and the
National Oceanographic and Maritime Institute.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is greatly concerned about sea level rise and
coastal erosion, Bangladeshi Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak
said while inaugurating the seminar here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Though it is not very easy to predict quantitatively the exact
extent of sea level rise over the next 100 years, it is obvious
that even nominal sea level rise will inundate a considerable area
of the coastal Bay of Bengal region affecting agriculture,
forestry, cottage industry and pushing the coastal people at a
great peril," he said.
</P>
<P>
The shoreline along the coast of Bangladesh encompasses 7,720
kilometers and some 21 percent of the population live in the
coastal belts, he stated, adding that the sea level rise will
compel internal migration causing disruption and serious
socio-economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Stating government vision, Razzak said that the Bangladeshi
government is fully aware of the problem of sea level rise and is
keen to see that necessary efforts are taken both in public and
private sectors to address the major issues.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of sea level rise is very real and global in
nature, specifically for the countries with low-lying coastal
areas like Bangladesh," he observed.
</P>
<P>
The scientific community has predicted that potential change
(in climate) would be visible approximately in the year 2070 in
grains yields if green-house effects are not contained and global
warming process is not slowed down, said Dr. Ata Qureshi, director
of Global Environmental Programs.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Aid Health Care Project in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has approved a concessional loan of 40 million U.S. dollars from
its special fund to promote the primary health care (PHC) of the
urban poor in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The bank's PHC project focuses on the preventive, promotive and
simple curative services, and will help increase the coverage of
health services like immunization, micro-nutrient support, family
planning and prenatal care among the urban children and women,
including the slum dwellers in the cities, bank sources said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project will finance at least 15 partnership agreements
with the private sector and non-government organizations in
delivering packages of basic services to improve the accessibility
of health services to the poor.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the inadequacy of PHC infrastructure, about 190
two-story health centers will be constructed near the slums and
other decently populated sites, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the project will reduce the economic costs of
poor health by decreasing workdays' lost due to disease, increase
productivity and reduce the chances of illness, according to the
sources.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Renovating Rural Electric Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China will continue the
renovation work on its rural electric networks in 1999 as part of
the government efforts to improve basic infrastructure and the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
This is based on a decision made during a State Planning
Commission and National Electrical Power Corporation meeting that
opened Thursday in the capital of Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Those present called for increased activity in all projects and
decided that no new projects will be started in 1999. To ensure
quality, they urged regional governments to improve project audits
and to crack down on corrupt construction practices.
</P>
<P>
The renovation work was a major Chinese Government decision in
1998. The Government also decided to lower the price of
electricity in rural areas to allow people there to pay the same
rates as in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Government allocated 42.5 billion yuan in spending
on projects in 1,500 counties nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Govt Wants Aung San Suu Kyi to Join Dying Husband </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government will
provide Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary of the National League
for Democracy (NLD), with all possible assistance in joining her
husband Michael Aris, who is dying in England, if she decides to
go, said an official Information Sheet here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Michael Aris is seriously ill in England and has been
hospitalized with prostate cancer which has spread to his spine
and lungs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Aris has requested a visa to Myanmar to see his wife which the
government is currently reviewing.
</P>
<P>
However, the Information Sheet said, the Myanmar health
authorities are surprised that he would request such a difficult
trip at this time, adding that according to a published report, he
would be unlikely to survive the trip.
</P>
<P>
"To undertake a trip to Myanmar under such conditions,
therefore, would appear to be both irresponsible and inhumane, and
the government is reluctant to encourage or endorse such an
action," it said.
</P>
<P>
"As a more sensible alternative, the government of Myanmar
suggests that Aung San Suu Kyi, who is in perfect health, travel
to England to respond to her husband's dying wish to see her. She
has so far refused to go," it added.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was married to Michael Aris, a British
citizen, in January 1972, traveling in England and giving birth to
two sons. She returned to Myanmar to see the then dying mother Daw
Khin Kyi, former Myanmar ambassador to India, in late 1988 when
the country was in a political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Aung San Suu Kyi has resided in the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Welcomes Rebels' Plan to Free Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Thursday
welcomed a plan by the National Democratic Front (NDF) to release
four military and police officers, but said that should be
complemented by a principled, sincere commitment to the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The government's main concern at this time is for the NDF to
undertake confidence-building measures to sustain the peace
process, presidential spokesman Jerry Barican told reporters here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NDF should show proof of its good faith by
stopping all their kidnapping and terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
"The reported intention of the NDF to release the officers is a
positive development in this regard," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF said Wednesday that it will release in a month's time
Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, Capt. Eduardo Montealto, Police Chief
Inspector Roberto Bernal and Sgt. Alipio Lozada, who had been
abducted by the rebel group during the past month.
</P>
<P>
The need right now is for the NDF to make a strategic and
principled commitment to the peace process and not merely a
tactical commitment intended to be used as a cover to prepare for
armed conflict, Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He said that should the NDF continue to ignore this appeal, the
 military and the police are both fully prepared to meet "any
contingency" that may arise from the rebels' criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday morning, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said the government will not suspend rescue operations for
the four police and military officers until the NDF specifies the
time and place of their release.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's police and the
military have been called to help deal with the Japanese
encephalitis (JE) outbreak, the national JE task force announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They will destroy some 64,000 pigs in three areas in the
southern state of Negeri Sembilan by Sunday, task force chief and
Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said after the task force's first
meeting here Thursday, according to the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The task force, also comprising Agriculture Minister Sulaiman
Daud, Housing and Local Government Minister Ting Chew Peh and
representatives from the defense, home and information ministries,
was formed by the Cabinet Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chua said that 1,400 security forces personnel were expected to
start work Friday using light arms.
</P>
<P>
Chua said fogging and larvaciding would also be intensified in
the three areas concerned using fire and rescue service
helicopters as well as land mobile teams to annihilate Culex
mosquitoes which transmit the deadly JE virus from pigs to humans.
</P>
<P>
"The top priority now is to bring the JE outbreak down," he
said.
</P>
<P>
So far there have been 47 deaths, 15 in the northern state of
Perak and 32 in Negeri Sembilan, and 47 others are still being
warded in various hospitals, according to Chua.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Cabinet allocated 35.5 million ringgit (9.342
million U.S. dollars) to conduct vaccination on 500,000 pigs and
292,000 residents in the affected areas in the two states.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) will provide
Bangladesh with an interest-free loan of 138.6 million U.S.
dollars to finance a municipal services project in the South Asian
nation, the national news agency BSS reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was approved by the WB in Washington
Tuesday, is aimed at improving environmental and infrastructure
facilities in urban areas, the BSS quoted WB Bangladesh country
office sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project would provide sanitation and drainage facilities,
widen roads and pavements, and improve water supply and street
lighting in the first phase, and would help establish a municipal
development fund to provide funding for municipal sub-projects in
the second phase.
</P>
<P>
The urban population in Bangladesh has been increasing quickly
at a rate of about 4.2 percent annually while the poverty rate in
the city remains high, with 11 million out of the 25 million city
dwellers living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 154 million
dollars, with 138.6 million dollars from the WB's soft lending
window, the International Development Association, and the rest to
be mobilized by the Bangladeshi government.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Attaining 1999 Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government remains
optimistic that it can attain its economic growth target for this
year despite a different forecast made by the World Bank, an
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, presidential spokesman Jerry
Barican said the government's target growth of 3-3.7 percent for
gross national product (GNP) and 2.6-3.2 percent for gross
domestic product (GDP) for l999 "is within reach."
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's recent forecast of 1.9 percent growth in the
Philippines this year did not carry a sectoral breakdown, he said.
</P>
<P>
GNP refers to the total value of goods and services produced in
a given year in the country as well as those coming from
Philippine businesses and services rendered abroad.
</P>
<P>
GDP, on the other hand, refers only to the total value of goods
and services produced within the country.
</P>
<P>
Barican said the sectoral growth suggests a 2.6-3.2 percent
growth for the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"This is virtually identical to the forecast of the
International Monetary Fund which is 2.5-3.0 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director General Felipe Medalla of the National
Economic and Development Authority said structural policy reforms
have the overall effect on further expanding the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
These structural policy reforms, according to Medalla, include

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of people killed in traffic accidents in France
in 1998 stood at 8,437, which represented a 5.6 percent rise over
the previous year and was the worst in 10 years. Apart from over-
speeding, drunkenness and tiredness which are blamed for causing
the accidents, the lack of police patrol, historical and cultural
backgrounds of the Latin people, and commercial offensives by the
auto industry are also elements contributing to the especially
murderous situation on French roads.
</P>
<P>
-- The Finnish forensic medicine doctor Helana Ranta gave a
prudent report on the result of her team's examination of the
bodies of 45 Kosovo Albanians who were massacred on January 25 in
Racak. The only conclusion of the report by the experts is that
the victims were unarmed civilians, which disputed the version
given by the Yugoslav authorities, who said they were Kosovo
Liberation Army fighters killed in combat.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French nuclear security watchdog, the Direction de la
Surete des Installation Nucleaies, Wednesday criticized the state-
owned electricity monopoly Electricite de France (EDF) for letting
376 incidents take place in the country's nuclear centers last
year. The EDF was accused of ``negligence, laisser-faire and
forgetting very simple things'' in the security of the centers,
but said that none of these accidents have raised any grave
problem.
</P>
<P>
-- After the French automaker Renault announced on Tuesday its
intention to buy 35 percent of the capitals of the Japanese
automaker Nissan, both financial players and unionists of France
are questioning the justification for the project. The stocks of
Renault dropped by 6.2 percent on Wednesday in Paris.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Erupt in N.Ireland Ahead of Lawyer's Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland erupted into
fresh violence on Wednesday night with nationalists, loyalists and
police clashing on the streets of Portadown, according to BBC
report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The unrest came as Catholic mourners prepared to pay their
last respects to lawyer Rosemary Nelson, who was killed by a car
bomb on Monday. A Protestant guerrilla group "Red Hand Defenders"
later claimed responsibility for the killing.
</P>
<P>
Sectarian violence flared at about 2000 GMT on Wednesday in
the Corcrain area of Portadown, just hours after loyalist leader
Frankie Curry was gunned down in Belfast during St Patrick's Day
festivities.
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) intervened --
many of them in full riot gear -- but the unrest quickly spread
with petrol bombs and paving slabs being hurled at police, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
A RUC spokesman said 38 officers had been hurt in the clashes,
although most had superficial injuries.
</P>
<P>
The police attended after reports came in of nationalists and
loyalists stoning each other, but when police intervened, they
came under attack from nationalist rioters.
</P>
<P>
The RUC responded with a volley of plastic bullets as at least
one car went up in flames in the Garvaghy Road, the spokesman
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to export more
machinery and electronic products, especially large complete units
and name brands with high added value, according to Xu Bingjin,
assistant to Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The focus will be on eight types of products for export
including power generators and transmitters, ship and marine
equipment, aircraft and aviation equipment, communications
equipment, automatic data processing units, high-grade household
electrical appliances, automobiles (motorbikes) and parts, and
farm and engineering construction machinery, Xu said at a national
meeting on machinery and electronics exports which opened here

machines, electrical equipment and products, and transportation
tools and instruments were exported last year, up 12.9 percent
over 1997.

competitive and are essential to the country's effort to realize
the goal of 71.5 billion dollars in exports in machinery and
electronic products this year, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his ministry will cooperate with the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> S.African President to Visit Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela will hold talks in Tripoli on Friday with Libyan
leader Muammar Qaddafi over Lockerbie bombing, and would then
address a rally in the capital Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Mandela would therefore only arrive back home in the early
hours of Saturday, South African Press Association (SAPA) Thursday
quoted Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana as saying through
telephone from Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is on the last day of his week-long state visit to five
north European countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's special envoy on Lockerbie, Jakes Gerwel, will also
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said Mandela had received a special exemption from
the United Nations to fly to the Libyan capital, despite the U.N.
air embargo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed that
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was aware of Mandela's
forthcoming trip.
</P>
<P>
"President Mandela's trip to Libya is done in coordination with
the secretary-general, and in support of the secretary-general's
ongoing efforts in the Lockerbie case," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled to leave Stockholm at 5:30 p.m. (1530
GMT). The flight to Tripoli would last about four to six hours,
Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has played a central role in efforts to break the
deadlock over the trial of two Libyan intelligence agents accused
of the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988. A total of 270 people died in the incident.
</P>
<P>
After refusing to have the pair tried in the United States or
Britain, Qaddafi agreed to a proposal that the trial be conducted
by Scottish judges and under Scottish law in The Hague, the
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> HK's Visitor Arrivals in February Surge 17 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Total cumulative arrivals for January and February reached 1.6
million, an increase of 13.9 percent over the corresponding period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The association attributed the increase mainly to the Chinese
Lunar New Year activities encouraged travel to Hong Kong and more
stable foreign exchange rate against the HK dollar.
</P>
<P>
Markets showing the strongest growth in February included the
Chinese mainland, from which arrivals rose by 65.2 percent due
mainly to favorable outbound policies, a shorter visa processing
time, and the Chinese New Year holiday period which encouraged
travelers to go overseas.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from the Republic of Korea, the Philippines and
Indonesia rose by 47.2 percent, 39.2 percent and 28.1 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
A growth of 11.5 percent was recorded in arrivals from Taiwan
and an increase of 10 percent in arrivals from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the stabilizing economy, the
strengthening Yen and a new air service between Tokyo and Hong
Kong helped to account for an increase of 3.2 percent in arrivals
from Japan in February.
</P>
<P>
The only shorthaul market to register a significant fall in
arrivals in February was Singapore from which the number of
visitors fell by 14.2 percent and arrivals from almost all
longhaul markets fell during the month due mainly to the Chinese
New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
These longhaul markets include New Zealand, Switzerland,
Britain, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Italy, France, the
Netherlands and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the HKTA, said: "We are very
encouraged to see that the strong growth in January has carried
through the Chinese New Year period, and arrivals so far this
month are also up."
</P>
<P>
However, she said there are still many challenges ahead, and
everyone in the tourism industry must continue to work hard to
maintain Hong Kong's competitiveness.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Thursday it may
Sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) before September
this year if the coercive atmosphere of sanctions is removed.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan may sign CTBT even before September 1999. But that
will happen only under pressure-free conditions and in the best
interest of the country," Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said in a
written reply to a question at the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said there is already some good progress towards creating a
conducive environment. "We sincerely wish this progress to
continue so that Pakistan can adhere to the CTBT within the time
frame announced by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif," he added.
</P>
<P>
Aziz recalled Sharif's address to the United Nations General
Assembly in September last year stating that Islamabad was
prepared to adhere to the CTBT by September 1999, "but only in the
conditions free from coercion or pressure." "This has been our
basic position," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that since September last year when
Pakistan faced unjustified sanctions following its nuclear tests
in response to those of India, "the coercive atmosphere has
eased."
</P>
<P>
He said sanctions against Pakistan on lending of International
Financial Institutions (IFIs) have been removed and the long
standing issue of F-16s with the United States has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he noted, the bilateral sanctions imposed by the
United States, Japan and other countries are also being gradually
softened.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the U.S. administration has already initiated the
process of further expanding the Brownback Amendment, also lifted
the sanctions from humanitarian assistance and, "hopefully, our
on-going bilateral discussions (on export control of nuclear
technology) would yield further good results."
</P>
<P>
"There are all positive developments. We hope efforts at
creating a coercion-free atmosphere would continue, enabling
Pakistan to fulfill its commitment," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said Islamabad is not against CTBT in principle. Pakistan
had participated in the negotiations for the treaty, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Aziz said that as clearly stated by Prime Minister
Sharif, Pakistan would not adhere to it in a coercive atmosphere.
"This is our principled position and cannot be compromised," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Addresses Implementation of Four-Point Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIPEI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) voiced hope today for enhancing
dialog between it and the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to
arrange and prepare for ARATS President Wang Daohan's visit to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
ARATS Deputy Secretary General Li Yafei made the remark during
a morning meeting to exchange of views with SEF Deputy Secretary
General Jan Jyh-horng.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS official suggested the two organizations should host
either forums or seminars in July or August this year.
</P>
<P>
Li proposed that the mainland host a forum on cross-Straits
relations to discuss issues of common concern, including political
topics, with Taiwan hosting a seminar on cross-Straits economic
ties.
</P>
<P>
Li said ARATS favors in-depth discussions on procedural matters
related to cross-Straits political negotiations and political
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two sides can also discuss issues
involving cross-Straits economic cooperation, and direct postal,
commercial and transportation links, as well as topics related to
agricultural, scientific and pharmaceutical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
ARATS holds that officially ending the state of hostilities and
realizing direct postal, commercial and transportation links are
prominent issues affecting the interests of compatriots on either
side of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Related issues should be resolved through dialog and
negotiations at the earliest possible date, said Li, adding that
matters involving life and property of compatriots on both sides
of the Straits and various other practical issues must be
effectively dealt with prior to the resumption of ARATS-SEF talks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two sides can discuss how to remove
political barriers hampering talks on substantial issues if SEF so
desires.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Wang and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu reached a four-
point consensus during Koo's visit to the mainland. The two sides
agreed that arrangement shall be made for Wang to visit Taiwan at
the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides have not as yet officially discussed the
proper time, Li noted, referring to an earlier SEF announcement of
"Wang's Taiwan visit in spring".
</P>
<P>
He said any unilateral announcement of Wang's timetable for the
visit and declaring it as a common understanding would not
indicate mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, Wang is expected to visit Taiwan this fall.
</P>
<P>
Li reaffirmed the invitation for the SEF deputy secretary
general to visit the mainland to continue discussions, and said
ARATS is willing to invite Shi Hwei-yow, vice-chairman and
secretary general of SEF, to visit the mainland in June to make
arrangements for further ARATS-SEF dialog.
</P>
<P>
The two sides can further exchange views on Wang's Taiwan tour
by that time, Li said.

<HEADLINE> China to Offer 4.8 Billion Yuan for Major Innovation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will spend
4.8 billion yuan (570 million U.S. dollars) for the implementation
of a state "knowledge-innovation program" through the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly released 4th Yellow Paper on China's
science and technology, China expects to acquire strong technical
support and make strategic scientific discoveries by the
implementation of this major program.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to be among the top-10 scientifically competitive
countries in the world by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Science and Technology
said the effective investment in science and technology
development, the early creation of a national knowledge-innovation
system, and a greater number of high-tech ventures are all part of
the major measures taken by the government to greet the 21st
century, a time when a knowledge-based economy will prevail.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that the central government has greatly
increased its financial support for the development of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the annual financial allocation for science and
technology development was 40.8 billion yuan (4.8 billion U.S.
dollars up 15.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Playing a major role in the implementation of the national "
knowledge-innovation program", the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS) last year began a trial operation of the program.
</P>
<P>
The CAC, the country's highest scientific research institute,
plans to establish 100 advanced scientific research institutions
and 20 interdisciplinary research centers by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
CAC Vice President Chen Yiyu told Xinhua that the CAS knowledge-
innovation projects will focus on strategic basic research,
sustainable development and high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
He explained that basic research will include the breeding of
high-yield crop seeds, the application of genetic resources, and
new pharmaceuticals for the treatment of wide-spread common
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that sustainable-development related research
projects include the development of the Yangtze and Yellow river
valleys and eco-agricutlural development.
</P>
<P>
High-tech innovations will focus on the future development of
information, telecommunications, genetic engineering, and the new-
materials industry.
</P>
<P>
A Yellow Paper has been issued once every two years by the
Ministry of Science and Technology since 1992.

BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai and Myanmar officials have
reached an agreement to end a maritime dispute that led to naval
conflicts late last year, Thai News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a two-day meeting that ended
Wednesday. The meeting, under the Thai-Myanmar Regional Border

</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, both armed and unarmed vessels of the two

<HEADLINE> China Reinsurance Company Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The China Reinsurance Company (
China Re), which grew out of the Reinsurance Company under the
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), was established here
today.
</P>
<P>
The PICC was disbanded in October 1998, and its subsidiaries,
including life insurance, property insurance and reinsurance, have
all become independent insurers.
</P>
<P>
The newly created China Re has a registered capital of 3
billion yuan, including 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission, attended today's founding ceremony, and said that the
establishment of China Re will help further perfect the country's
insurance market and prompt the sector to develop on a sound and
smooth track.
</P>
<P>
China Re's predecessor, PICC, had its reserve fund increased
from 4.87 billion yuan in 1996 to a current six billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
PICC, now China Re, the country's only state-owned insurer
specializing in reinsurance, has developed into a modern
reinsurance company based on international standards, according to
general manager Dai Fengju.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Balance of Payments in 1998 Posts Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines Thursday announced that the overall balance of
payments position for the 1998 yielded a surplus of 1.35 billion
U.S. dollars, a reversal of the year ago deficit of 3.36 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank governor Gabriel C. Singson attributed the
turnaround to the 1.29-billion-U.S. dollar current account
surplus, only the second to be recorded since 1980 and a definite
improvement from the 4.4-billion-U.S. dollar deficit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
For 1998, merchandise exports reached 29.496 billion U.S.
dollars to end the year with a robust 16.9 percent growth, Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
The growth in exports was "quite a feat considering the
substantial decline in exports of other Asian countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Imports, on the other hand, amounted to 29.524 billion U.S.
dollars, falling by 18.8 percent from last year's level of 36.355
billion U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the demand for imported raw materials and capital
goods indicated the contraction in overall economic activity when
gross domestic product slumped by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the period, net investment flows recorded an increase of
119.4 percent. What was notable in the investment flows was that
the growth was driven by direct investments and not by portfolio
investment, Singson said.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Results Show Lagos Lagoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results of a study
indicated that the Lagos lagoon system could be over-polluted due
to the discharge of faecal waste, trace metals and hydro-carbons.
</P>
<P>
The study on Lagos lagoon is part of a study for the Gulf of
Guinea Large Marine Ecosystem being undertaken by a team of
scientists from Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria and
Togo, according to a New Nigerian report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, which is aimed at testing the manual of
standard methods for pollution monitoring in the six participating
nations, the Ido section of the Lagos lagoon has been found to be
highly polluted with faecal waste.
</P>
<P>
Professor Dapo Afolabi of Nigerian Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, who plays host to the team of scientists, said
detailed results of the tests on samples collected from the lagoon
were yet to be released.
</P>
<P>
Lagos has a population of more than six million and about 2,000
 industrial establishments most of which discharge effluents
directly into the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
Lagos lagoon system is suspected to be one of the worst
polluted inland fresh water bodies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Afolabi said the tests would determine the presence of heavy
metals, hydro-carbons and other harmful elements in the lagoon and
their impact on the lagoon's carriage capacity.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes to Halt Operations Against Rebels for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Thursday
expressed willingness to suspend military operations against the
rebel New People's Army (NPA) in exchange for the release of four
officers abducted by the NPA.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora in
response to a call from the rebels for the suspension of military
operations.
</P>
<P>
However, Zamora said in an interview that "we will not allow
ourselves to be hoodwinked in putting ourselves at a
disadvantage."
</P>
<P>
"If the captors of these hostages say why don't you give us a
month, obviously, those are outrageous and unreasonable demands,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the rebels' leader Jose Ma. Sison called on the
government to withdraw and halt its military operations so the
release of prisoners of war could be safely effected.
</P>
<P>
Sison said preparations for the release may take about three
weeks to one month since both sides will have to agree on the
terms of the withdrawal of military troops in the area.
</P>
<P>
Philippine army general Victor Obillo and his aide were
abducted on February 17 by the NPA guerrillas. Police inspector
Roberto Bernal and army staff sergeant Alipio Lozada were snatched
later in separate raids.
</P>
<P>
The abductions forced the government to call off peace talks
with the rebels last month and to suspend the scheduled release of
about 50 jailed rebel guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Ex-wife Confirms Australian IOC Member Accepted Jewelry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian International Olympic
Committee (IOC) member Phil Coles was left in a serious danger of
expulsion after his former wife claimed on Thursday he accepted
jewelry from Athens' bidders for the 1996 Olympic Games, a fact he
had just flatly denied.
</P>
<P>
Coles was among the ten IOC members who were given a severe
warning by the IOC for accepting free holidays from Salt Lake
City's bid committee for the 2002 Winter Games. He has been
warned that his position on the IOC was at risk if more evidence
was uncovered.
</P>
<P>
Georgina Coles told The Australian Financial Review the couple
received a gold necklace, and a pair of diamond-encrusted
cufflinks which she later had converted to earrings, when visiting
Athens during the city's bid for the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
"Yes I've still got the jewelry," she told the daily. "It was
given to us in Athens 10 years ago on one of our Olympic trips."
</P>
<P>
Canadian IOC vice-president Dick Pound, who led the IOC
investigation, said the new claim would be investigated.
</P>
<P>
The jewelry in question is worth about 10,000 Australian
dollars (6,300 U.S. dollars) and was allegedly given to Coles at a
time when IOC rules limited the value of gifts to 200 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The former canoeist flatly denied accepting the jewelry during
a radio appearance earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Though he escaped this week's round of expulsions from the
Olympic body, the IOC has said it plans to investigate the jewelry
allegations laid by organizers of Melbourne's unsuccessful bid for
the 1996 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, DRC Discuss 750 Soldiers' Plight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian and Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) governments have opened bilateral talks
aimed at finding ways of repatriating the 750 Congolese soldiers
and policemen.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman in
Zambia Dominik Bastch said Wednesday the soldiers were not being
treated as refugees but as ex-military.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Zambian newspaper, the Post, quoted Bastch as saying
:" Soldiers don't come under our mandate. They are not refugees."
"But if the negotiations between the Zambian and the DRC
governments are protracted, we will continue to extend
humanitarian assistance to them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bastch said the influx of refugees fleeing renewed fighting in
the DRC has reduced and there had been no reports of new arrivals
since the over 5, 000 refugees crossed into Zambia on March 15.
This figure includes some 750 soldiers and policemen, who have
since been separated from the civilian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Bastch, however, could not state the exact number of refugees
who have crossed into Zambia so far.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know what the total tally is. There has been no
update in terms of numbers," Bastch said.
</P>
<P>
This week a high level mission, comprising representative from
the World Food Program (WFP), the UNHCR, the International Red
Cross Society and the Zambian government are scheduled to travel
to Kaputa in Northern Province, to assess the situation on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
And according to Bastch, Angolan refugees have continued to
trickle into Zambia at a rate of 20 every week.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Imports Down Dramatically in 8 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's imports in the first
eight months (July to February) in the 1998-99 fiscal year stood
at 5.846 billion U.S. dollars, registering a major decline of
1.192 billion dollars against the same period in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The imports of wheat and machinery during the eight months
declined sharply in comparison with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures by the Federal Bureau of Statistics show
that Pakistan purchased a total of 671.33 million dollars of wheat
in the first eight months of last fiscal year. However, the import
bill of wheat from July to February period in the 1998-99 fiscal
year fell to 224.50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Machinery import during the period also decreased to 1.299
billion dollars from 1.662 billion dollars in the corresponding
period of last fiscal year mainly because of differences between
the government and the private power producers on the tariff
issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the import in petroleum group declined by 28.23
percent, and that in agricultural and other chemicals group fell
by 15.40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Finance Ministry claimed Thursday that the
government policy of cash margin condition levied on the opening
of letter of credit played a key role in bringing down import bill
in the wake of suspension of loans by the donors and sanctions
imposed by some western countries after Pakistan's nuclear tests
in May last year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan's import bill will further fall at
the end of the current fiscal year because of the slow economic
activities in the country.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Open Regional Office in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States' software giant
Microsoft is to open an office in Beirut, which is responsible
for its businesses in Lebanon, Jordan and Cyprus, the Daily Star
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by Bahram Mohazzebi, general manager
for Microsoft Gulf and Eastern Mediterranean at a news conference
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came just one day after Lebanese parliament
passed the controversial intellectual property rights bill
designed to combat software piracy.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have copyright laws in a country, it would be
difficult for us to invest in that country, because we would have
no protection for our investment," Mohazzebi said.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft has warned that if Lebanese parliament postponed to
pass the law, it would set up the regional office in Jordan or
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressure from international software companies,
especially Microsoft, Lebanese parliament Wednesday endorsed the
copyright law attached with an amendment saying a school or
university could take original program copies for educational
purposes and not for profit.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies have been firmly opposed to the law, citing such
a bill would eventually harm the interest of students who can't
afford to buy a costly original computer program.
</P>
<P>
However, software manufacturers complained that they lost
millions of dollars each year due to illegal software reproduction
in Lebanon, where the piracy rate is estimated at 90 percent or
higher.
</P>
<P>
Mohazzebi said his company would do its best to help the
government with the implementation of the approved law.
</P>
<P>
But he didn't give exact investment figures, saying only
that Microsoft's biggest investment in Lebanon would be in the
form of knowledge and know-how.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Tighten Arms Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The South African parliament
on Wednesday approved an arms bill which restricts the lending of
licensed firearms, The Citizen paper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The owners of licensed firearms can only lend their weapons to
other licensed arm owners in terms of the Arms and Ammunition
Amendment Bill.
</P>
<P>
The current legislation allows licensed firearm owners to lend
their arms to anyone, provided they signed a letter of
authorization.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Safety and Security Minister Joe Matthews told the
parliament that the amendment bill was an interim measure, and a
comprehensive new Arms and Ammunition Bill was being drafted to
replace the outdated one.
</P>
<P>
He said the old law was widely abused, especially by gangsters
in the Western Cape, parts of which have been plagued by repeated
violence in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The new bill, which will come before parliament later this
year, would deal with issues like training for potential firearm
owners, limited periods of license validity and strict criteria
for obtaining licenses, Matthew said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Surprised at Israeli Fury over Arms Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has expressed surprise at Israel's fury over Egypt's planned
purchase of U.S. weapons, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic-language Al-Gomhuria daily on
Wednesday, Mubarak said that Israel makes a big fuss every time
Egypt seeks to acquire weapons.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in Cairo a week ago, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen announced that the U.S. will sell 3.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of advanced weapons to Egypt in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
The weapons, some of which Cohen said are the most
sophisticated in the U.S. arsenal, include 24 advanced-model F-16
fighters, 200 M1-A1 tanks and one eight-unit Patriot 3 model
anti-missile battery which has 32 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979. But the two countries have been in a "cold peace"
due to the intransigent policy toward the peace process adopted by
the Likud coalition of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
since it assumed power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"They (Israelis) obviously do not want anybody (else) to own
these weapons (in an attempt) to maintain their supremacy in the
region," Mubarak stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president made it clear that seeking sophisticated
weapons does not mean preparing for a war. "Our policies are clear
to everybody. We seek to establish peace and nothing but peace,"
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that every country is entitled to have the
necessary arms to defend its own security.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Egypt is a major defender of regional peace
because it knows that realization of peace will bring stability
and development to the whole region.

<HEADLINE> Expert Assesses Qinghai Weather Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A Qinghai meteorologist attributes
the strong winds and persistent sandstorms which swept through
southern Qinghai Province between March 3 and 10 to the region's
high altitude and warm temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Gao Wuxiang, a senior expert and deputy chief of the Qinghai
Provincial Meteorological Station, said persistent strong winds
rarely occur in pastureland areas located at 4,000 meters above
sea level.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Gao, the closeness of the ground to upper
air currents due to the region's high altitude creates conditions
for the circulation of strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Continuous warm temperatures and dry weather since winter also
contributes to the strong winds which killed an estimated 20,000
head of livestock, mostly sheep. An additional 5,200 head of
livestock died later from starvation resulting from inadequate
grass cover.
</P>
<P>
The strong winds and sandstorms also damaged 130-odd houses and
24 sheep pens, destroyed some 30 percent of the grass coverage,
and cut power supply, telecommunications and closed TV circuit
lines in some places.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern China province witnessed warmest year in 60
years during 1998, when average temperature was one to three
degree centigrade above normal. In the first half of March, the
average temperature was even four to seven degree above normal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a prolonged drought hit vast stretches of pastoral
areas which normally record between 7-20 mm of snow in March.
</P>
<P>
Precipitation in most parts of the province have ranged between
70-100 percent below normal since last autumn, according to
meteorological data.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds normally accompany prolonged periods of drought,
said Gao, adding that the frequency of winds is directly related
to the severity of drought conditions.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological departments predict that southern and western
portions of Qinghai Province, as well as areas around Qinghai Lake,
will continue to experience strong winds over the next few days,
with related conditions posing a severe threat the maturation of
grass in pastoral areas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Water Raises Tension Between Jordan, Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian-Israeli relations are
facing a major challenge as the crisis over water-sharing between
the two countries starts to build up tensions.
</P>
<P>
The tensions originated from an Israeli plan earlier this week
to reduce its water supplies as stipulated in the peace treaty to
this desert kingdom by 40 to 60 percent in the coming summer.
Reason: a drought is hitting both of them.
</P>
<P>
The water crisis is the worst of its kind since the two
countries signed a peace treaty in 1994. It also posed the first
diplomatic challenge to the brand new Jordanian government headed
by Prime Minister Abdel Raouf al-Rawabdeh, appointed by King
Abdullah Bin Hussein on March 4.
</P>
<P>
The Rawabdeh government has rejected the Israeli plan as a
violation of the peace treaty, and declared that Jordan would
under no circumstances agree to a reduction of water share from
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Under their treaty by which Jordan became the second Arab
country to realize peace with the Jewish state, Israel is entitled
to 12 million cubic meters of water from the Yarmouk River from
May 15 to October 15. Jordan extracts the rest of the river flow.
</P>
<P>
From October 16 to May 14, Israel pumps out 13 million cubic
meters of water from the Yarmouk river, and Jordan allows Israel
to pump an additional 20 million cubic meters from the river.
</P>
<P>
In return for the additional water, Israel promised to
transfer 20 million cubic meters of water to Jordan from the
Jordan River that runs between them in summer time. It now wants
to nearly half its compensation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli plan also met with fierce opposition from the
Lower House of the Jordanian parliament, which issued a statement
on Wednesday, saying the "Israeli move casts suspicion on the
Middle East peace process as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"It`s a violation of the fundamentals of peace treaty and
sheds doubts on Israeli commitments to the treaty," said the
sharply-worded statement.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen out of the 80 lawmakers even lodged a motion to
revoke the whole peace treaty to protest Israel`s plan to cut
water supplies, but motion was aborted as it failed to win a 41
simple majority.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has viewed the water clauses as the key and most
fundamental elements in the 1994 peace treaty between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side, however, tried to play down the issue by
saying that it was only a suggestion to cut the water supplies,
and it is open to discussion.
</P>
<P>
The summer is drawing near and the regional drought is still
prevailing, but how to share water in the coming month would put
to test their bilateral relations as well as the 1994 peace
treaty.

LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The experts from the Diplomatic
Security Wing (DSW) of the state department and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) of the United States have
handed over their findings on Zambian Capital Lusaka bombings to
the government.
</P>
<P>
United States Information Service (USIS) director George Newman
 confirmed the experts' conclusion of their assignment into the
Lusaka bombings Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Newman said the bomb experts who have since left Zambia had
handed over their report on the bombings to the State, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Newman said details of the experts findings would be made
public by the Zambian government as the undertaking was only to
offer technical expertise to the local team.
</P>
<P>
He clarified that the experts were not agents from the Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI) but from DSW and BATF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambian Government Spokesman Newstead Zimba, who is
Information and Broadcasting Minister, said the experts could have
directly submitted their findings to Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba.

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Visit "A Historical Event": Austrian Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming state visit of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Austria is "without any
exaggeration a historical event," said the new Austria ambassador
to China Erich Buttenhauser.
</P>
<P>
Arriving in China less than a month ago, the ambassador is
returning to his country to prepare for President Jiang's visit.
Before his departure, he answered Xinhua's questions on Jiang's
visit and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that "this is the first time that a Chinese head
of state will pay a visit to our country, and President Jiang
Zemin is reciprocating two state visits to China by Austrian
presidents in 1985 and 1995."
</P>
<P>
According to Buttenhauser, President Jiang is expected to "have
a wide-ranging exchange of views with his Austrian counterpart,
President Thomas Klestil, on all matters of common concern, and
discuss ways and means of promoting bilateral relations,
especially in the field of economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Since Austria and China established diplomatic relations in
1971, the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
have "developed impressively," he said, adding that there is still
untapped potential on both sides in various fields, including
environmental protection projects.
</P>
<P>
Concerning China's relations with the European Union (EU), he
said that "all EU member states follow a common approach toward
China as spelled out on the 'Building A Comprehensive Partnership
with China' document adopted last year by the EU's Council of
Foreign Ministers."
</P>
<P>
With an integrated domestic market and the Euro as the single
currency, the EU is "an important partner for China economically
and politically beyond any doubt," he noted, adding that both
sides have "enormous potential to enhance cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Cultural exchanges between China ad Austria have witnessed
tremendous growth in recent years, and the ambassador said he
considers such contacts "very important to further mutual
understanding between the two peoples."
</P>
<P>
Austrians are now enjoying more Chinese cultural performances
staged in Vienna and other cities, while Austrian musicians, in
particular the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and the Vienna State
Opera have been welcomed in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, according to the ambassador, there will be a Viennese
music garden at the World Horticultural Fair in Kunming, capital
of southwest China's Yunnan Province later this year, and a Johann
Strauss exhibition and folk music performances are planned for
Beijing in October. "We will continue to promote bilateral
cultural activities between our two countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Strengthening Monitoring of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Finance Minister Jin
Liqun Thursday urged the international community to strengthen the
monitoring of short-term capital flows and to reform the
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Jin made this call in a speech at the first meeting of finance
and central bank deputies from nine members of ASEAN plus China,
Japan and the Republic of Korea (9+3).
</P>
<P>
The convening of the "9+3 meeting" on finance was proposed by
Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao at the second informal summit of
East Asian countries held in Hanoi last December.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jin said the financial crisis in Asia has been
going on for well over one year now. Financial crises are not new
demons wrecking havoc of the economies in the world. But none of
the crises witnessed so far hit so hard on many economies in a
matter of months, and with such devastating impact.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the causes of the financial crises, Jin said there
are some defects within the affected economies. But there are also
serious deficiencies in the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
Particularly destabilizing are swings of huge volumes of
short-term capital flows prowling around the globe in pursuit of
quick profit, said the Chinese senior financial official.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "international efforts on crisis resolution
and prevention cannot be effective if their focus is just directed
on domestic issues of individual economies, while marginalizing
the destabilizing factors external to those economies."
</P>
<P>
Jin noted that the Asian financial turmoil has revealed serious
flaws in the structure of financial markets and in the ways the
players in the markets are regulated. While the trend of global
integration is irreversible, appropriate actions can certainly be
taken to reduce the frequency and amplitude of financial market
swings.
</P>
<P>
"Financial markets would not swing so wildly if financial
institutions were more closely monitored," the official said,
adding "this has particular relevance for emerging economies, as
an interplay of domestic financial-sector weakness and
international capital flows inflicts even more violent impact."
</P>
<P>
Jin said the quick spreading of the recent crisis has offered
us so much food for thought in contemplating reforming the
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, he said, in an increasingly integrated world,
financial turmoil in any one economy also poses serious danger to
others. Crisis does not stay confined in one economy, or even one
region. It can spread through current-account linkages among
economies, through capital account transactions, or just be
triggered by sheer investor perception of linkages.
</P>
<P>
Jin said there is no absolute "safe haven." No "firewalls"
between economies with "resilient financial systems" and emerging
market economies.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interests of every economy to cooperate closely
with each other in strengthening the monitoring of short-term
capital flows and mitigating the potential violence of financial
system turmoil," Jin stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese official also noted that strengthening
monitoring of short-term capital flows is not intended to impede
the flows of capital. "Rather, such efforts aim at promoting
capital flows in an orderly fashion," Jin said.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that "concerted efforts in this area will be a big
step forward in making the global financial system more conducive
to sustainable economic growth and social development."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Gains Success in Anti-Drug Abuse Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's anti-drug abuse campaign
has achieved successes in the past more than three months, press
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the campaign were reported at a meeting of Vietnam's
National Drug Control Committee held in Hanoi Wednesday, which
reviewed the implementation of the prime minister's decree
ordering the campaign against drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
From November 30, 1998 to March 15, 1999, policemen, customs
officers and border guards nationwide detected 3,826 cases of drug
trafficking involving 7,640 offenders and confiscated more than 14
kilograms of heroin, 106 kilograms of opium and 68.3 kilograms of
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese people's courts in this period tried 541
drug-related cases involving 857 offenders, of whom 19 were given
death sentences.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 97,000 registered drug addicts, including 8,000
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Most drug trafficking cases were detected along the
Vietnam-Laos border but marijuana trafficking was also detected
along the border with Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
About 45,000 square meters of opium poppy fields and 760 square
meters of marijuana and coca crops were destroyed in the period.
However, some destroyed fields along the Vietnam-Laos border have
been re-grown with opium poppy.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has also intensified the fight against drug abuse in
offices, resident communities and schools. Almost 2,200 drug
addicts were sent to detoxification centers in the period.
</P>
<P>
The media also carried extensive reports aimed at raising
public awareness of drug control policies.

<HEADLINE> Drought Conditions Threaten Winter Wheat in Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drought has adversely affected over a third of China's
cross-winter crops, the Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has urged local governments to strengthen field
management in areas such as irrigation and fertilization.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth of winter wheat during the unseasonably warm
winter increased the vulnerability of the crop to colder weather,
according to one ministry official.
</P>
<P>
"Wheat is subject to freezing if temperatures drop suddenly,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers planted cross-winter crops on 33 million
hectares in 1998, including some 26 million hectares of winter
wheat.
</P>
<P>
The lack of sufficient precipitation and higher temperatures
since September last year have exacerbated the situation in the
country's leading wheat growing bases in the Yellow and Huaihe
River valleys, as well as various areas in northern China.
</P>
<P>
However, drought conditions have eased somewhat in parts of the
Huaihe River Valley, including Anhui, Jiangsu and Hubei provinces,
as well as southern areas in Shandong and Henan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Local meteorological departments forecast the arrival of
measurable precipitation in northern wheat-growing areas over the
next several days.
</P>
<P>
Summer grain yields account for approximately 25 percent of
China's annual grain production. The total grain output for 1998
hit 490 million tons, with 14.6 million top drop in the summer
grain output offset by an increase in autumn grain production.
</P>
<P>
China recorded good grain harvest for four consecutive years
prior to 1988.

<HEADLINE> Water, Soil Conservation Project Going Well in Gansu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A World Bank-financed project has
brought soil erosion under control in a large part of the Malian
River Valley in northwest China's Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
The Malian River Valley covers an area of 4,304 square
kilometers on the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and has a
population of 508,000. Serious soil erosion had caused
agricultural conditions to deteriorate until 1994, when a loan of
69.64 million U.S. dollars, including 40 million U.S. dollars from
the World Bank, was utilized for a project, which curbed this
trend toward ecological imbalance.
</P>
<P>
Water and soil conservation now has returned to normal in more
than 60 percent of the Malian River Valley land, and trees and
grass now cover more than 30 percent of its total acreage, local
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
This effort greatly spurred the growth of the local economy,
and the valley's poor population had been reduced to 18.5 percent
of the total by the end of last year, from 40 percent in 1994.

HOHHOT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-eight projects funded by
the central Government over the past six months, concerning
renovation of power grid, transportation and telecommunications,
have promoted economic development in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Government allocated an additional 200 billion yuan (24
billion US dollars) in the latter half of last year for
infrastructure construction in the region.
</P>
<P>
Related funding has also sparked growth in investments from non-
state enterprises and individuals, with the latter category alone
rising by 16.6 percent. Fixed asset investments for 1998 grew by
10 percent on the previous year's level to 35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The sales rate for industrial products grew from 92 percent for
the six months of 1998 to 96.6 percent for the year as a whole.
The heavy industry sector reversed low-speed, or in some cases
negative growth, and recorded 6.5 percent growth by the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The new funds have mainly gone to infrastructure construction,
including housing, transportation, telecommunications and
infrastructure projects in urban areas. The region has also
encouraged development of the service sector in order to create
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Real estate, community services, and post and
telecommunications sector have recorded the most rapid economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say Laws Needed To Prevent Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists said at a
recent Chinese government meeting that a legal system is needed to
prevent geological deterioration.
</P>
<P>
The scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Chinese Academy of Engineering said that nearly 50 percent of the
land, mud, and rock slides, land subsidence, erosions, sea water
encroachment, and desertification are caused by human beings and
that these are an obstacle to economic growth and social stability
in the areas where they occur.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 cities and counties and about 10,000 villages in
China are threatened by land, mud, and rock slides and land
subsidence has been reported in 46 large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Desertification is largely attributed to the building of
reservoirs and dams that go against the law of nature.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that a thorough study has been done and that a
related regulation issued by the Ministry of Land Resources is
working well and that conditions are right for the National
People's Congress to pass a related law.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, government institutions have monitored
disasters caused by human beings. During last year's floods, 52
mud and rock slides were successfully predicted.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Parliament Approves Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Winding up the debate, Nawakwi called on all Zambians to work
hard and free themselves from poverty.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will not develop through the supply of foreign aid,
Times of Zambia quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sam Chipungu from the opposition National Party, and
two independent parliament members, Crispin Sibetta and Robert
Sichinga, urged the government to itemize constitutional and
statutory expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The three parliament members argue that the 376 billion kwacha
(180 million U.S. dollars) allocated for constitutional and
statutory expenditure is too large to be approved without the
government specifically explaining where the money would go.
</P>
<P>
Sichinga highlighted the need for internal debt servicing,
stressing that interest rates will remain high as long as the debt
to local suppliers remains high.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional and statutory expenditure includes domestic
debt service, foreign debt service and wage adjustment.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the country's budget expenditure depends on
foreign assistance.

MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government Thursday
assured the public that it is preparing for possible terrorist
acts that may be staged by the New People's Army (NPA) to mark its
founding anniversary on March 29.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said in a radio
interview that the intelligence community is anticipating possible
actions by the NPA on that day.
</P>
<P>
"The intelligence coverage is going on, and the military and
the police authorities would anticipate the reaction of the other
side," Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the government has not received any
"significant information" other than an alleged standing order
from NPA officer Armando Liwanag to his cadres.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said Liwanag's supposed order, which calls for
"intensive and extensive operations against the government," was
released through the internet.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching out for any specifics that they will do,"
Aguirre said, citing reported plans by the rebels to abduct or
liquidate government officials.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Woman Wounded in Israeli Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- An elderly Lebanese woman was
wounded Wednesday night when Israeli warplanes staged several
raids on villages in south Lebanon, the Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes dropped bombs between Jabal Botom and
Zibqine, north of the western sector of the Israeli occupied
border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The planes returned 20 miniutes later and bombed the area
surrounding Shaitieh, north of Zibqine, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Wassila Khalil, 67, from Zibqine, was struck in the head by
shrapnel when a bomb exploded beside her as she was working in a
field.
</P>
<P>
Eight houses in the village were also damaged in the raids,
which came shortly after the nearby Israeli Blat and Teir Harfa
outposts were shelled by Lebanese guerrillas of the Iran-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Another civilian, Youssef Alayan, was wounded earlier Wednesday
when Hezbollah guerrillas fired rounds at the Israeli Biyada
radar station inside the border zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to drive Israeli occupation forces
and its ally South Lebanon Army out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota, San Antonio to Play in 1999 NBA Japan Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves and the
San Antonio Spurs will play two regular season National Basketball
Association (NBA) games in Tokyo in November, the NBA announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled fixtures mark the fifth time NBA has staged
regular season games in Japan, according to the league.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA Japan Games have become a highlight of our calendar,"
said NBA Commissioner David Stern. "Our Japanese fans are among
the most enthusiastic, and we are pleased to continue our
tradition of playing regular season games at Tokyo Dome."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the NBA became the first American professional league
to stage regular season games outside North America when the
Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz opened the 1990-1991 season in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Houston Rockets and Seattle SuperSonics opened the
season with two games in Yokohama, as did the LA Clippers and the
Portland Blazers in 1994. In 1996 the event moved to the lager
Tokyo Kome, where the two games between the New Jersey Nets and
the Orlando Magic drew over 75,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
Minnesota and San Antonio will play at Tokyo Dome on November 6
and 7. It will be the first time to play in Japan for the two
teams.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China, Switzerland Sees Steady Trade Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- From Nescafe to Rolex watches,
from Schindler elevators to Swiss knives, products made in
Switzerland are becoming increasingly familiar to Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese products, such as garments and textile goods,
machinery and electrical appliances, and chemical goods, have also
become very popular in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Sino-Swiss trade relations and economic
cooperation have been expanding steadily, officials with the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation MOFTEC)
said in an interview with Xinhua on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders from China and Switzerland have had a frequent
exchange of visits since 1992 and the two sides have signed a
dozen bilateral agreements on trade and other issues," said an
official with the European Affairs Department of the MOFTEC. "The
upcoming state visit by President Jiang Zemin to Switzerland will
further boost the bilateral trade and economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is China's second largest trade partner in western
Europe after the European Union. Bilateral trade volume hit a
record in 1997 of 1.486 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of imports and exports in 1998 between the
two nations reached 1.43 billion US dollars, down 3.8 percent.
China's exports to Switzerland were recorded at 634 million US
dollars, up 3.4 percent, and imports from Switzerland 796 million
US dollars, down 8.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Swiss investment in China has grown in a big
margin in the 1990s. The Roche company, the Ciba-Geigy company and
the Nestle company, for instance, have established many
pharmaceuticals and foodstuff joint ventures in China.

<P>
In addition, China and Switzerland have enjoyed smooth
cooperation in the financial sector, said MOFTEC officials. The
Swiss Government has provided four government loans to China since
August 1984, totaling 350 million Swiss Francs (about 260 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Those loans have been used in the construction of more than 60
projects in the areas of textiles, telecommunications, medicine,
machine-building, electricity, environmental protection and civil
construction.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is also a major technology supplier to China.
Between 1979 and the end of 1998, China has approved the signing
of 640 technology transfer contracts with Switzerland, involving
some 1.41 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China and Switzerland established diplomatic relations in 1950,
and Switzerland was one of the first western countries to
recognize New China. And the Sino-Swiss Joint Trade Committee,
established in December 1974 following the signing of a bilateral
trade agreement, has held 14 meetings so far in Beijing and Berne
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Government granted China universal favorable
treatment in 1979 and has always given an active support to China
in its bid to join the World Trade Organization (WTO).

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIPEI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Wang Daohan, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will
visit Taiwan this fall, ARATS announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Wang is expected to travel with his wife to Taipei and the
southern port city of Kaohsiung during his five or six days in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Word of the trip came after Li Yafei, ARATS' deputy secretary
general, exchanged views this morning with Jan Jyh-horng, deputy
secretary general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), on
matters relating to Wang's Taiwan visit and ARATS-SEF dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Li said the four-point consensus reached between Wang Daohan
and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu last October is an important basis
for the contact and exchanges between ARATS and SEF at present,
noting that consensus will be crucial to improve cross-Straits
relations.
</P>
<P>
ARATS believes that Wang's Taiwan visit is a continuation and
development of the high-level talks between ARATS and SEF which
began last year.
</P>
<P>
Wang will exchange views with Koo on the political and
economic issues and other aspects of cross-Straits relations. Wang
will also meet with a number of officials.
</P>
<P>
ARATS hopes that Wang's visit will bring about further
achievements following Koo Chen-fu's mainland tour last year, and
said this depends on concerted efforts from both sides.

<HEADLINE> China Everbright Bank Acquires Assets, Liabilities, Offices of CIB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China Everbright Bank officially
takes over assets and liabilities of former China Investment Bank
(CIB) today along with the transfer of 137 banking offices under
the CIB all over the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaohua, chairman of Everbright, signed the agreement with
Chen Yuan, president of China Development Bank (CDB), at the Great
Hall of the People this morning.
</P>
<P>
The CIB was merged into the CDB last December and its 20
regional branches were converted into CDB branches on March 16.
</P>
<P>
Total assets involved in this transfer are 80 billion yuan (9.6
billion US dollars), according to the People's Bank of China, the
country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Non-performing loans from the CIB, which largely stem from sub-
loans from the World Bank, will be reduced to less than 20 percent
after the write-off of the bad loans, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that non-performing loans in foreign exchange,
which account for 78 percent of CIB's total non-performing loans,
will be dealt with by Everbright acting as an agent to collect
these loans for the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the non-performing loans will be written off by net
asset and capital reserves of the CIB as well as capital from
Everbright, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
The 137 banking offices of the CIB in China's major cities
including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou will be
complementary to Everbright's business, and the cost of the
transfer will be much lower than that of establishing new offices
there, he said.
</P>
<P>
China Everbright Bank is a joint-stock commercial bank with
state-owned companies as its major stockholders. Its pre-tax
profit in 1998 was 1.31 billion yuan, and its per capita profit
was number one among China's domestic banks.
</P>
<P>
Zhu anticipates that the bank's profit next year will reach 2
billion yuan after absorbing the assets of the CIB properly, and
he expects that this figure will grow to 2.6 billion yuan in 2001.
</P>
<P>
All the certificates of deposits, treasury bonds, and other
securities issued by the CIB will remain effective, and all
contracts and agreements on loans, inter-bank lending and
borrowing, and bond repurchases by the CIB will remain valid,
according to Everbright.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Chinese National People's Congress, attended the signing ceremony
along with officials from the central bank and the Ministry of
Finance.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Banks Show More Interest in Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Commercial banks in Shanghai,
China's leading industrial and commercial city, are now taking
steps to give greater support to small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The first bank to enhance these is the Bank of Shanghai which
began to provide special loans to small and medium-sized firms in
1996, setting up a service center for these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Among the 210,000 enterprises that have opened accounts with
the bank, 170,000 are small and medium-sized high-tech,
manufacturing and retail businesses.
</P>
<P>
Another bank, the Shanghai Branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, recently announced ten new measures to
support these firms, including a special department in charge of
loans and the simplification of loan procedures.
</P>
<P>
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are more flexible and
competitive than larger ones, and they should get greater
financial support," said branch chief Jiang Jianqing, adding that
his branch will grant loans on the basis of efficiency rather than
size.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises have usually been neglected
by banks, and many have found it difficult to expand due to a lack
of funds over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say this new support represents a strategic
change in bank lending policy which is intended to foster new
growth areas.

<HEADLINE> Regional Disarmament Meeting Opens in Kathmandu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Regional Disarmament
Meeting in Asia and the Pacific began here Thursday, bringing
together 38 participants from 25 countries and organizations in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is hosted by the Regional Center for
Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific of the United
Nations Department for Disarmament Affairs.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Evgeniy Gorkovskiy, deputy to the
United Nations Under Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs,
said the meeting will focus on nuclear tests in South Asia,
security issues in the Korean peninsula and cooperation between
the United Nations and regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, flow of arms in civil society,
poverty eradication and cooperation on environment conservation
are also on the agenda of the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said the nuclear tests conducted last year by
India and Pakistan posed great challenges to the well-established
and globally-supported norms of non-proliferation and non-testing
of nuclear weapons as well as the norm of nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at their recent summit, prime ministers of the
two countries agreed to make efforts to reduce tensions in the
sub-continent, which included commitment to taking immediate steps
toward reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorized use of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to review existing
confidence-building measures and where necessary, to engage in
mutual consultations on the monitoring and implementation of such
measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting will provide an opportunity for participants from
the two states to inform the Asia-Pacific community about the
details of the agreements and how these states expect to implement
them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said for the first time, the three existing
regional organizations in the region -- the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation, the South Pacific Forum and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will present reports
on their respective activities.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this meeting will serve as an opportunity for both the
regional center and the three organizations to work out a way of
maintaining contact and increasing interaction to tackle common
recognized challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
Established and given a clear mandate by U.N. General Assembly
resolutions, the regional center for peace and disarmament is the
broadest-based dialog mechanism in the region, encompassing South
Asia and Central Asia in addition to all of East Asia, Oceania and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The annual gathering in Kathmandu has been often referred to as
the Kathmandu Process.
</P>
<P>
The meetings "provide an invaluable forum for leading
diplomats, government officials, scholars and non-governmental
organizations to exchange views on current challenges in the field
of disarmament and security," Evgeniy Gorkovskiy said.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience so far confirms that such an informal
atmosphere facilitates the friendly and constructive discussion of
even the most sensitive and highly contentious issues," he added.

<HEADLINE> Timely Snowfall for Northeastern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Another light snowfall last
night, the fourth this month, has brought moisture to drought
stricken northeastern China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
There has been more snow than usual in March in northeastern
China's Jilin Province, as opposed to its usual windy climate at
this time of the year. This has helped alleviate drought problems
and pollution which have persisted throughout the winter.
</P>
<P>
Another snowfall is predicted for today or March 19. The
average amount of snowfall has been around 17 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
Discussing their relief at the change in the weather, a
resident of Changchun City said, "Most families keep warm by a
coalfire, which gives off a lot of dust and smoke, and a shortage
or lack of snow has made the air condition even worse."
</P>
<P>
And farmer Liang Shuhua said, "We were afraid that the lack of
snow might result in drought and affect our spring sowing."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Qiwen, head of the Jilin Provincial Meteorological
Observatory, noted that snowfalls made the temperature of the
whole province this March four degrees centigrade lower compared
with corresponding periods in the past.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Changchun Environmental Protection Bureau
said that the snow has improved the air quality in a big way.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang's Visit Historical: Italian Ambassador to China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome is the political center of Italy, Milan a city of
economics and trade, and Venice world renowned for its stunning
architecture and scenic views, Paolo Bruni said.
</P>
<P>
Following Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's visit to
China last year, President Jiang Zemin will pay a state visit to
Italy from March 20 to 25, the first stop of a three-leg European
tour, which also includes Switzerland and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Bruni believes that the itinerary reflects the purpose of
Jiang's visit -- promoting cooperation between the two countries
in political, economic, cultural and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit is also historical and signals the importance of
the good relations between Italy and China, Bruni said during a
recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador added that the visit will create an opportunity
for the two presidents to discuss a number of international and
regional issues of common concern, and to explore ways to further
promote world peace and security as well as ways to avoid the
negative effects of the continuing Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bruni said diplomatic ties and trade relations between the two
countries can be traced back to ancient times. Since Marco Polo's
book allegedly first introduced China to the world some 750 years
ago, many contacts in the cultural and scientific fields have been
made.

<P>
"All of these factors have considerably promoted bilateral
cooperation in a wide range of sectors," Bruni said, expressing
the conviction that Jiang's visit would push forward such
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
For most Chinese, Italy is known for its glorious wine and
fashionable clothes, Bruni said. However, he pointed out that some
80 percent of Italian exports to China are products based on
science and technology. "The present economic and trade
cooperation is sound, but there's still immense development
potential," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China now is Italy's third largest trade
partner out of Europe. "The two governments are encouraging
cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises, seeking to
expand trade volumes and mutual investment."
</P>
<P>
The ambassador revealed that Jiang's entourage would include a
number of high-ranking economic and trade officials and that they
will meet representatives of a number of Italian industrial groups.
</P>
<P>
"For two countries with such ancient civilizations, cultural
exchange is one of the most important aspects of dialog," Bruni
commented. Last year, the Teatro Communale di Firenze presented
Puccini's opera Turandot in China's Forbidden City and in March
this year the China Peking Opera Theater is performing in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"People are looking forward to more such cultural events which
can help them better understand each other," Bruni said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, President Jiang will probably find
some time to enjoy an Italian opera during his stay in his country.

HEFEI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China's first domestic manufactured
steam locomotive was "retired" recently after 47 years of service
and is expected to be put on display in the locomotive museum in
Datong in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The locomotive was manufactured by the Sifang Rolling Stock
Plant in east China's Shandong Province in July 1952 and had been
in use in east Anhui Province until 1992.
</P>
<P>
China stopped producing steam locomotives in 1987 due to
environmental and economic reasons and so far there are only a
small number of them still running in the country.
</P>
<P>
China now mainly produces internal-combustion and electric-
power locomotives.
</P>
<P>
As many as 927 million passengers traveled by trains in China
in 1998, with cargo traffic reaching 1.523 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
China added 994 kilometers to the length of its electrified
railways lines in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country will invest 55 billion yuan on railway
capital construction, in a bid to add 1,320 kilometers to its
railway lines and 730 kilometers to the electrified lines.

<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Internet advertising sector
will be much favored in China amidst a booming computer market and
the Internet surfing craze, according to China Commercial News.
</P>
<P>
With no time and space limitations, Internet advertising has
better opportunities for development compared with other
advertising methods. Internet surfers only need to click the mouse
to get information, and through e-mail, customers and the staff of
enterprises can keep in direct contact with each other.
</P>
<P>
"But Internet advertising is only at a nascent development
stage in China, and it has not produced its due economic returns,"
an Internet advertisement designer has said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, several factors stand in the way of
development. The most obvious ones are the low-level of design
ability and inappropriate distribution.
</P>
<P>
Major players in the sector are now stepping up their efforts
to upgrade technology in this regard and substantial achievements
have already been made.
</P>
<P>
China's Internet surfers are expected to hit 4.5 million by
2000, and experts believe Internet advertising will become a
favorite sector in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Rejects FBI Probe Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) has sent an officer to Harare to discuss the
arrest of three American nationals with the Zimbabwean government
and offer assistance to investigating agencies, but the officer
was rejected, the daily Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. embassy spokesman in Harare confirmed Wednesday that one
FBI agent and a U.S. customs officer arrived in the country Monday
from Pretoria, South Africa, ostensibly to offer assistance to the
Zimbabwean multi-agency investigating team.
</P>
<P>
However, the two left Harare Wednesday after their offer was
turned down.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the offer was first made to Zimbabwean
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri, who told them the
multi-agency investigating team did not want any assistance from
outside forces. The offer was also turned down by the Zimbabwean
government.
</P>
<P>
Source said the FBI and customs officers were refused access to
the arrested Americans at Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. nationals were arrested at the Harare
International Airport on March 7 for illegal possession of
offensive weapons and other war materials.
</P>
<P>
However, embassy officials were Wednesday granted permission to
visit the trio.
</P>
<P>
The multi-agency investigating team is yet to receive
additional information on the activities of the three suspects
from the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
The embassy last week dissociated itself from the three
suspects who were found with a wide range of arms of war.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the three Americans have admitted
plotting to assassinate President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic
Republic of Congo as part of their efforts to install a "godly"
government in the war-torn country, the Herald reported.

<HEADLINE> China To Plant Trees along Yellow River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
will launch a massive afforestation campaign this year in the
Yellow River Delta, one of the country's three major river deltas.
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 hectares of land will be afforested over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
This move is designed to further improve the ecological
environment of the delta, paving the way for fast economic
development, said Sun Qingchuan, vice director of the provincial
forestry department.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the Yellow River Delta has long been
economically backward because of saline soil and various disasters,
and this is in sharp contrast to the prosperity and high economic
growth of the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, which depends largely on the Yellow River for its
water supply, has been suffering from a water shortage in recent
years as flow stoppages occur more frequently on the river because
of reduced rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The new forests, which will be planted at a cost of 240 million
yuan, will grow along the lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The province has selected trees such as locusts and willows
which can better survive in the saline soil for this project.

<HEADLINE> China, Finland to Strengthen Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to strengthen
and advance ties with Finland and raise bilateral cooperation in
various fields to a new level, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tang, who arrived in Helsinki Tuesday at the invitation of his
Finnish counterpart Tarja Halonen, made the remarks during
separate meetings with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and
Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen.
</P>
<P>
Tang said Sino-Finnish relations had witnessed rapid growth in
recent years through the efforts of the two countries' leaders.
</P>
<P>
Though geographically distant from each other, Finland and
China have no historical contentions nor contradictions in
interests. The peoples of the two countries have fostered sound
friendship with the continuous deepening of mutual understanding,
the Chinese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He observed that both countries should review their long-term
interests and lay a solid foundation for their mutually beneficial
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The next year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment
of diplomatic ties between Finland and China, Tang said. The
Chinese government and people are willing to join hands with the
Finnish government and people to bring the Sino-Finnish ties
closer together.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Tang's viewpoints on bilateral ties, President
Ahtisaari said Finland is very glad to establish close relations
with China and is satisfied with the rapid development of Sino-
Finnish ties.
</P>
<P>
He said Finland values and attaches importance to its
cooperation in judiciary practices and human rights and the
achievements gained through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the two countries will expand their cooperation on the
basis of equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lipponen expressed his satisfaction with the
earnest and rapid implementation of the various agreements which
he struck with his Chinese counterpart during his visit to China
last year.
</P>
<P>
He was particularly satisfied with the two countries'
cooperation in the field of forestry and expressed a willingness
to further strengthen this mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Sino-European relations, the Chinese foreign
minister said China and Europe should strengthen cooperation and
explore new dialogues that not only conform to the fundamental
interests of both, but would also promote Asia-Europe cooperation,
world peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Finland would play an active role in promoting
the development of China-Europe ties and the elimination of the
European Union's discriminative measures against China's trade
when it holds the rotating presidency of the EU in the second half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said Finland supports the efforts by the EU and China
to build an active and broad partnership. He acknowledged that
both countries will enjoy favorable conditions to deepen
cooperative measures once Finland assumes the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Finland is the first leg of Tang's five-European-nation tour.
The Chinese foreign minister is scheduled to head for Stockholm to
continue his visit after winding up the trip to Finland Thursday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Down 26.9 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Japan's trade surplus in February
dropped 26.9 percent from a year earlier to 934.2 billion yen (8.2
billion U.S. dollars) due to a larger decline in exports than
imports, the Finance Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Japan's trade surplus has fallen in
three straight months.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports contracted 12.3 percent to 3,591.2 billion yen
(31.5 billion dollars) for the 60th straight month decline, while
imports decreased 5.7 percent to 2,657 billion yen (23.3 billion
dollars) for the 14th straight month, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States fell 22.7 percent to 414.9 billion yen (3.6 billion dollars)
because of a 49.4 percent plunge in shipments of steel to the US,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to its Asian neighbors dropped 18 percent while
imports increased 1.8 percent. As a result, Japan's surplus with
these countries slumped by 57.3 percent to 208.8 billion yen (1.8
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The surplus with the European Union inched down 0.1 percent to
348.4 billion yen (3.1 billion dollars), its first fall in three
months, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The yen averaged 114.18 to the U.S. dollar in February, up 10.2
percent from a year earlier.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The president and secretary-
general of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
announced on Wednesday that the president would step down to let a
new leadership work out rules for selecting PRI candidates for the
2000 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
PRI President Mariano Palacios Alcocer and his Secretary-
General Carlos Rojas Gutierrez made the surprise announcement at
the start of the new session of the party's governing council.
</P>
<P>
Palacios explained that the reason for his resignation was "to
renew the party's strength ahead of the 2000 elections" and to
make the selection of the PIR 2000 presidential candidates more "
democratic and transparent."
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources said the two PRI leaders were resigning
under heavy pressure from inside the party. The president's
resignation is effective as of April 1.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago the PRI, the world's longest-ruling party,
celebrated its 70th anniversary in power. President Ernesto
Zedillo announced at the celebration that he would break with
tradition and not hand-pick the party's presidential candidate. He
urged the party to hold an internal election.
</P>
<P>
Replacements for the two leaders will be chosen through the
first democratic election within the PRI in the party's history.

WASHINGTON -- The strong economic growth of 1998 brought the
new year with robust consumer spending, brisk construction
activity and increasing demand for labor, the U.S. Federal Reserve
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, prices of most goods remain little changed and
businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases, the Fed
said in a survey of regional economic conditions before March 8,
known as the "Beige Book." Analysts said the combination of
thriving economic growth and absent inflation detected in the
survey implies Fed policy-makers probably will opt for no change
in interest rates when they meet on March 30. (US-Economy-

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Former Interim President Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's former interim president
Alarcon Rivera has been arrested on charges of abuse of power, the
Supreme Court announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested Tuesday after the court ordered an arrest
warrant.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor was Cecilia Calderon, a deputy in the leftist
party.
</P>
<P>
In July, 1997, Calderon accused Rivera of illegally employing
over 1,000 people in 1996 when he was president of the National
Chamber of Representatives. He said the positions were redundant
and unnecessary because the employees were doing nothing for the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
After an investigation that lasted one year, the Supreme Court
found him guilty of many other crimes and ordered a preventative
arrest warrant against him.
</P>
<P>
Rivera pleaded innocent and said facts would prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
He was elected parliament speaker in June 1996 and became
interim president in February 1997. He finished his term on
August 19, 1998.

<HEADLINE> German, Austrian Premiers Discuss EU Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) summit
scheduled for next week in Berlin should make the formation of a
new European Commission a priority, German Federal Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following his meeting with Austrian
counterpart Viktor Klima, Schroeder said he believed incumbent
European Commission President Jacques Santer would not run for
another term as commission president.
</P>
<P>
The 20-member European Commission resigned on Tuesday after
independent experts accused it of turning a blind eye to fraud and
cronyism, of losing control of the EU bureaucracy and shirking
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Ending the crisis stemming from the commission's resignation
has topped the agenda of Schroeder's tour to EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU should make a decision soon on the formation of a new
commission after its Berlin summit, Schroeder said, adding that
the new executive arm should be more "transparent, honest and
clear" and should be able to monitor the use of funds better in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder hoped the Berlin summit would reach consensus on the
Agenda 2000 financial reform plan.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the current president of the EU, would press hard for
farming and structural reform plans and Agenda 2000, the EU's
spending reform plan for the years 2000 to 2006, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who began a tour of EU capitals Monday in
preparation of the Berlin summit, arrived in Vienna Wednesday and
will head for Greece and Italy the same day.

<HEADLINE> Germany Favors Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The German government on Wednesday
expressed deep concern over the stalemated Kosovo peace talks
underway in Paris and said it will work to "the last minute" for a
peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said that Germany would
continue to push for a peaceful settlement to the Kosovo crisis if
only the co-chairman of the Kosovo peace talks, French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Minister Robin Cook,
have not declared a breakdown of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with a population of 2 million, is an Albanians-
dominated province in southern Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
Fighting has been going on since early last year between the
secessionist Albanians and Serbian security forces, leaving nearly
2,000 dead and tens of thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from Western countries to end the conflict,
the Serbian delegation and the representatives of ethnic Albanians
began a second round of peace talks in Paris on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But the talks are now in an impasse as the Serbs still refuses
the deployment of NATO peace-keepers in Kosovo despite NATO's
threats of strikes against Yugoslavia's strategic targets.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said hopes are slim for the two sides to sign
the U.S.-sponsored peace plan which is composed of a political
part and a military part. The stationing of NATO troops in Kosovo
is the centerpiece of the military part.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians expressed their willingness to sign the peace
plan before the resumption of the negotiations, but so far they
have not done so.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea on Monday reiterated NATO's threat.
Speaking on a German television, he warned that the Yugoslav
government should sign the peace agreement this weekend at the
latest or will "face serious consequences."
</P>
<P>
However, he said that only after the rival parties sign the
peace accord will the nearly 10,000 NATO troops, currently
stationed in Macedonia, enter the embattled province.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan to Withdraw From CIS Mutual Visa Exemption Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan has decided to
withdraw from the agreement between the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) on the "mutual exemption of visas"
because of "chaotic" exchanges on its borders with immigrants and
other personnel crossing in great numbers, the Interfax News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted the Turkmen Foreign Ministry source as
saying that the ministry has sent notes on the withdrawal to the
competent CIS executive authorities based in Moscow and Minsk, the
Belarus capital.
</P>
<P>
Executive authorities will spend at least three months
reviewing the application for a withdrawal from the agreement.
Turkmenistan intends to formally withdraw from the agreement in
June, the source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In explaining reasons for the withdrawal, the source said the
chaotic exchange of personnel has made it difficult to control the
situation at border areas. However, the withdrawal does not
necessarily mean that Turkmenistan will sever its relations with
other CIS states, which were once union republics of the former
Soviet Union, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
The CIS agreement on mutual exemption of visas was signed in
1992. Turkmenistan has been the first country to withdraw from it.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Army will perform
its duty to protect the Serbian province of Kosovo and will never
allow the presence of foreign troops on its territory, Commander
of the Yugoslav Third Army Nebojsa Parkovic said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while inspecting an artillery brigade in
Aleksinac in southern Yugoslavia, said a report from the official
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that supreme leaders of the Yugoslav Army,
as well as the Yugoslav people, want the army to protect every
inch of the federal republic's territory at all costs. He also
called upon all men in the artillery brigade to do their best to
fulfill the honorable mission of protecting their motherland.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing peace talks regarding Kosovo, which resumed Monday
morning in Paris, France, are expected to result in a peace
agreement presented by the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
No deadline was given for the two warring sides to accept the
peace plan, but European Union officials expect the talks to end
within one week.

<HEADLINE> China's Traditional Medicine Industry Eyes Overseas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to promote the entry
of traditional Chinese medicine into the world market through
furthering overseas understanding of Chinese medical culture.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
has been carrying out a 10-year program for TCM development abroad
since 1997, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The program would see the establishment of about 60 TCM clinics
overseas, the opening of TCM courses in 10 foreign higher-
education institutes, and a rise of the sale of TCM products
worldwide, it said.
</P>
<P>
China exports herbal materials and TCM health food worth 600
million US dollars to some 130 countries each year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration told the newspaper that
progress has been achieved. Four medical schools overseas have
already established TCM courses, and two TCM drugs treating cardio-
and cerebralvascular diseases have been registered for import at
the Food and Drug Administration of the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
"We hope TCM can be incorporated into medical care and health
insurance systems in a number of foreign countries by 2008," said
Li Zhenji, the deputy administrator.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper revealed that Singapore and Victoria state of
Australia planned to introduce legislation to accept TCM on a
formal basis.
</P>
<P>
In order to encourage more countries to accept TCM, China has
sent hundreds of medical teams abroad in the past three decades,
whose members helped train local medical workers in TCM while
treating patients.
</P>
<P>
China has trained about 150,000 overseas students from 130
countries and regions in TCM over the past 30 years.

BUCHAREST, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania will further develop
relations with China on the basis of its "One China" policy, a
senior Romanian official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Romania and China have been developing
smoothly after the two established diplomatic ties 50 years ago
and it has never been affected by changing internal or
international situations, Romania's new ambassador to China Ioan
Donca told Xinhua before leaving for China to take office.
</P>
<P>
Donca, who used to be the director of the general bureau on
Asian, African, Latin American and Pacific affairs of the Foreign
Ministry, firmly believed that Taiwan would return to China just
as Hong Kong did in July, 1997, and Macao will do in December,
1999.
</P>
<P>
He also urged China, a major political and economic nation, to
invest more in Romania to promote political and economic relations
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Newspapers Dismiss Lab-Theft Fantasy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. newspapers have
published articles criticizing the anti-China campaign championed
by some media organizations and Republican Congressmen and calling
for continued engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Time described the
lab-theft charges against China as "absurdly overblown" and "a
nostalgia for confrontation".
</P>
<P>
"The current China spy hysteria is based on a hyping of threats
that are woefully irrational," it said.
</P>
<P>
"For the past century, we have meddled in Chinese affairs as if
the Middle Kingdom were nothing more than a playground for our
great power fantasies," the article said. Despite its "
overwhelming" mischief-making, the U.S. always insists on "playing
the role of victim," it added.
</P>
<P>
The article lashed out at the New York Times, which has led the
"China spy" rhetorics since earlier this month, calling it a "
shame on the media". It also criticized those Republican
politicians "who play the frayed China card" just to win elections.
</P>
<P>
"In the process, they undermine a sensible policy of engagement
pioneered by President Richard Nixon some 30 years ago," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "The Christian Science Monitor" also published an
article calling on the United States not to lose China again. It
said that some politicians in the U.S. tried to boycott China and
pressure that country into docile behavior, but "history gives
little support to such tactics."
</P>
<P>
"What's needed now is not U.S. confrontation, but continued
active engagement" with China, the paper stressed.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that the U.S. make "a constructive, truth-speaking
summit" with China's leaders in Washington next month, carry out
negotiations to bring China into the World Trade Organization,
make regular high-level consultations between the two militaries
to seek steps to curb nuclear proliferation and go ahead with
technology exchanges on pollution control.
</P>
<P>
"The Wall Street Journal" also voiced its worry over the
espionage propaganda. An article issued by the newspaper on
Tuesday said that a group of computer companies, including
International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., Sun
Microsystems Inc. and Unisys Corp, are launching a counter-
offensive.
</P>
<P>
According to the article, those computer giants have formed a
lobbying group called the Computer Coalition for Responsible
Exports. A study issued by the team shows that U.S. restrictions
on high-tech exports to China and other countries are "out of date.
"
</P>
<P>
"China will be the second-largest computer market in the world
by the year 2000," the article quoted Dan Hoydysh, director of
Unisys's Washington office as saying. The computer tycoons here
are trying to persuade the government to loosen export controls to
China because "the technology has left the restrictions behind,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that the anti-China propaganda has put the
GOP -- the Republicans -- into a dilemma, since for all their high-
flight talks on national security, "Republicans ill afford to
completely alienate business, a core GOP constituency."

continuation of state modernization, which includes various health
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement does not include new taxes or the extension of
present taxes. The document was presented to the directorate of

<HEADLINE> China Issues New Standards to Tighten Auto Emissions Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The State Quality and Technical
Supervision Administration has promulgated four new standards
tightening controls over vehicle exhaust emissions to improve air
quality in China's cities.
</P>
<P>
The standards will be applied to a range of vehicles
manufactured after January 1, 2000, Yin Minghan, director of the
administration's Industry and Transportation Standardization
Department, was quoted as saying by today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Liquefied petroleum gas vehicles, compressed natural gas
vehicles and those powered by diesel engines, which are not
covered by the existing State standards, will also be regulated by
the new standards.
</P>
<P>
"Current vehicle exhaust emission standards were issued 10
years ago, when private cars were not so common and environmental
problems not so serious," said Yin.
</P>
<P>
Chinese vehicle population has increased by 1.5 times to
approximately 13 million during the past decade, and is expected
to exceed 20 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Urban air quality reports in Beijing indicate that more than 60
percent of environmental pollution comes from exhaust or tail gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the new standards beginning next year is
expected to result in a remarkable improvement in air quality, the
official said. Tail-gas emissions are expected to be cut by 80
percent by then.
</P>
<P>
"Besides bringing about cleaner air, the standards will also
spur domestic auto manufacturers to work towards more advanced
technologies, and foster a stronger sense of responsibility for
the whole society," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
Key domestic auto manufacturers have been invited to
participate in drafting the standards to ensure that the 80
percent decrease in exhaust emissions is within their
technological capabilities.
</P>
<P>
State standards for unleaded petrol are expected to be
published by the administration this May, and are expected to take
effect on January 1, 2000, while standards for diesel fuels will
also be issued this year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the administration will work in close
cooperation with public security bureaus and transportation
departments to draft stricter exhaust emission standards for
vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2000, the official said.

<P>
TIRANA, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Albania and Macedonia called on
Yugoslavia to sign the Kosovo peace plan soon; they are insisting
that the presence of NATO in Kosovo is the only way to ensure a
lasting peace in the province.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Defense Minister Luan Hajdaraga and his Macedonian
counterpart Nikola Kljusev made the statement at a press
conference in the Macedonian capital city of Skopje.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed the current situation in Kosovo and
coordinated their positions on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
They said military forces from both countries were seeking a
political settlement to the Kosovo issue and hoped Yugoslavia
would sign the peace agreement in Paris soon.
</P>
<P>
Albania and Macedonian are neighbors of Kosovo. NATO has
deployed 10,000 troops in Macedonia which are preparing to enter
Kosovo after the peace talks end in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are underway with little hope of ending in a
deal. Serbians still oppose NATO deployment in the province.
</P>
<P>
Rival ethnic Albanians have said they will sign the agreement,
which gives them self-rule in Kosovo instead of the independence
they seek.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Agree to Free Abducted Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The New People's Army (NPA) rebels
will free a Philippine army general and three other military and
police personnel as soon as the details for their release are
worked out, the Philippine Star newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Ma. Sison, head of the National Democratic Front, of which
the NPA is the military arm, was quoted as disclosing this in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Sison said the rebel front still has to thoroughly discuss the
"procedural mechanics" for the eventual release of the captives.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on military units in Mindanao, the
southern Philippines, to "withdraw and halt their operations so
the release of the prisoners of war could be safely effected," the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The office of Senator Loren Legarda, who joined a group of
priests negotiating the freedom of the officers, announced that
the captives were likely to be release early Friday, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The office also announced that the release would be
"unconditional," it.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department and armed forces officials welcomed the
offer of release, but said this was subject to consultations with
higher authorities, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Army General Victor Obillo and his aide were abducted on
February 17 by the NPA guerrillas while Police Inspector Roberto
Bernal and Army Staff Sergeant Alipio Lozada were snatched later
in separate raids.
</P>
<P>
The abductions forced the government to call off peace talks
with the rebels last month and suspend the scheduled release of
about 50 jailed rebel guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Introduces Extensive Ecological Program (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cao Wenzhong, a Regional Forestry Department official, says
that in the past years the regional government has banned the
cutting of trees for farmland and adopted a series of measures on
planting trees, seeding, closing mountain forests, and water and
soil conservation for an environmental protection screen.
</P>
<P>
To encourage people to help improve the ecology, the regional
government also has worked out a contract and share-holding system
for planting trees on deserts and mountains.
</P>
<P>
Wang Minghai, a businessman, was one of those who volunteered
for the desert reclamation project and helped create the Engbey
miracle. In 1989, he gave up his business and began devoting
himself to desert control and spent nearly all of his savings on
the desert control project.
</P>
<P>
His actions moved Seiei Tohyama, a Japanese who later joined
Wang's program. In the past decade, the two men have turned more
than 7,000 hectares of deserts into oases.
</P>
<P>
Cao Wenzhong says that about 730,000 hectares of grassland or
forest have been planted or reclaimed by now.
</P>
<P>
Yunbulong, the region's chairman, says that this year the
region will increase spending on environmental protection and will
use around one billion yuan for this purpose.

HOHHOT, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Engbey area of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region's Hobq Desert has wild hares playing on
grassland under rows of trees and wild ducks and gray cranes on a
man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
A regional Forestry Department official says that it is just
one part of a large ecological protection screen running from the
Da Hinggan Ling Mountains in to the Alxa Gobi Desert. But it's
hard to imagine that just a few years ago the land was nothing but
a desert.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, sandstorms have hit Alxa League to the west of
the region every year, affecting not only the region, but even
Beijing and surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
Now China is placing emphasis on the ecological development of
Inner Mongolia, according to a State Forestry Administration
official. Of 10 major forest projects of China's central
government, five are in the region.
</P>
<P>
About a third of the "Sanbei (northern, northeastern, and
northwestern China) Forest Protection Screen" is in the region. (

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Predicts Further Economic Gains in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The strong economic growth of
1998 brought the new year with robust consumer spending, brisk
construction activity and increasing demand for labor, the U.S.
Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, prices of most goods remain little changed and
businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases, the Fed
said in a survey of regional economic conditions before March 8,
known as the "Beige Book."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the combination of thriving economic growth and
absent inflation detected in the survey implies Fed policy-makers
probably will opt for no change in interest rates when they meet
on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal information
collected by the Fed's 12 regional banks, confirmed statistical
reports showing the economy maintained its vigor through January
and February despite continuing problems in agriculture,
manufacturing and energy production.
</P>
<P>
The book said that even in manufacturing, where some companies
have struggled with exports lost to the world economic slowdown
that began in Asia in 1997, there are some improvements in most
districts.
</P>
<P>
Six banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Va., St. Louis,
Minneapolis and San Francisco reported stronger manufacturing and
five banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas
reported mixed conditions. Only one, Kansas City Bank, said
manufacturing remained weak.
</P>
<P>
Though "foreign competition depressed textile, apparel and
energy-related industries," the survey said, "post-holiday
discounting and mild weather in some regions" contributed to
continued strength in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
It said, "motor vehicle sales increased, led by light trucks,
and furniture sales benefited from robust home sales."
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, however, "continued to be plagued by low farm
commodity prices, and an increasing number of farmers were under
financial stress," the survey said. Also, three districts --
Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco -- " reported that
falling oil prices were causing some oil and gas wells to be
withdrawn from production.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Beige Book said, the overall economy
retained its vigor and "labor markets remained tight."
</P>
<P>
"Finding qualified workers has become more difficult in several
districts, and reports of faster wage increases were more
widespread than in recent months," it said. And in the New York
and Kansas City districts, even "finding entry-level workers was
difficult."
</P>
<P>
However, it said, prices remain stable with the exception of
construction material such as lumber, drywall and insulation.
</P>
<P>
In a speech Tuesday, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said that
despite near-term challenges in agriculture, most farmers and farm
lenders remained optimistic about the sector's long-term prospects.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Belarus President Alexander
Lukashenko on Wednesday denied rumors that Russian nuclear arms
will return to his country in response to NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"There was no talk of the return of nuclear arms during
conversations with Russian President Boris Yeltsin," Interfax
quoted Lukashenko as saying at a meeting with labor
representatives in Dokshitsy, a city in Belarus' northeast Vitebsk
region.
</P>
<P>
He accused some Russian political groups and media of intending
to "use Lukashenko as a bogeyman for the West."
</P>
<P>
Certain political forces in Russia "want to frighten the West
with myself and nuclear arms," Lukashenko said.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that he had tried to dissuade Yeltsin from
the accelerated withdrawal of nuclear arms from Belarus several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, the former chairman of the Belarussian Supreme
Soviet, who was then the head of state, signed a corresponding
international treaty and Belarus strictly fulfilled its
commitments under it," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dynamo Kiev Eliminate Real Madrid at Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine made a
stunning shot on Wednesday by ousting defending champions Real
Madrid from the European soccer Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Dynamo, who topped their section of the Champions' League in
December after patches of sometimes brilliant play, hit the
heights again despite months without competitive soccer to defeat
Real 2-0 for a 3-1 aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
Kiev now have a real chance of becoming the first team from
Ukraine to be crowned European champions in the final in Barcelona
on May 26.
</P>
<P>
While Kiev qualified for the semifinals of the Champions League
for the first time since 1987, Juventus took their by now
customary place in the last four after a late goal saved them from
elimination in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, beaten finalists last year and bidding for their
fourth successive European Cup final, were trailing 1-0 to
Olympiakos Piraeus and heading out of the competition on the away
goals rule with the aggregate scores level at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
But with five minutes to play skipper Antonio Conte struck the
goal that kept Juventus's dreams of glory alive.
</P>
<P>
Back in Italy, Inter Milan's hopes of winning the European Cup
for the first time since their back-to-back wins of 1964 and 1965
were ended by Manchester United, seeking their first European Cup
success since their only victory in 1968.
</P>
<P>
United, 2-0 up from the first leg at Old Trafford, defended
resolutely for the first hour, but finally cracked in the 63rd
minute when Nicola Ventola took advantage of some sloppy United
covering to lash home from close range.
</P>
<P>
That goal inspired Inter to increase the tempo and seek a
second, but they failed to find another goal.
</P>
<P>
Instead, substitute Paul Scholes, who had only been on for 11
minutes, put the issue beyond doubt when he also scored from close
range to force the draw and give United a 3-1 aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
The result keeps United on course for a treble of domestic
league and cup and European Cup and also meant that they had
eliminated an Italian side for the first time in their 42-year
European competition history.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich are also chasing a domestic double and success in
Europe and stayed on course for their first European Cup victory
since 1976 after crushing Bundesliga rivals Kaiserslautern 4-0
away for a 6-0 aggregate win.
</P>
<P>
The draw for the semifinals will be made in Geneva on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Crystal Palace: Venables Owed Two Million Pounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Former England manager Terry
Venables is still owed two million pounds from Crystal Palace,
according to local reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Palace have been forced to call in administrators as the money
owed to Venables, who has already been paid almost one million
pounds, is just a fraction of their overall debts of 22 million
pounds, with a further 500,000 pounds being lost every month.
</P>
<P>
The club do have assets worth 13 million and chairman Mark
Goldberg, who has already lost the 23 million he paid to buy out
Ron Noades last summer, has invested a further 1.5 million. But
unless Goldberg and administrator David Buchler can cut the huge
wage bill, slash costs and attract new investment over the next
three months, even their optimism will count for nothing.
</P>
<P>
Crucial to Palace's future will be agreeing terms with their
long list of creditors, which include several English and European
clubs as well as banks - but most famously Venables and his former
assistants at the club.
</P>
<P>
The ex-England coach was paid his 750,000 pounds annual tax-
free salary up front last summer when he took over as well as
being given a Mercedes, the use of a house, an unsecured interest-
free loan and a cut of revenue from player sales.
</P>
<P>
Although a final deal has still not been reached with regard to
the settlement of the four years remaining on his contract, Palace
anticipate that it will be a further 2 million.
</P>
<P>
However, Venables is unlikely to receive the full amount as -
like many other creditors - he is expected to have to agree to
part-payment or to accept shares in the club instead to obtain
anything at all.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg said: "It is easy to say in hindsight that it was a
foolish deal. But there are clubs where managers are offered
certain salaries, bonuses and share options and it has been a
great success."
</P>
<P>
The Palace chairman was speaking alongside administrator
Buchler, who has previously turned around Millwall, as he
expressed his belief that the First Division club could survive
the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Goldberg also cautioned that Palace were not alone and that
their plight should serve as a warning to other clubs not to "
chase the dream" of an instant return to the hallowed land of the
Premiership by continuing to pay inflated salaries.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Germany Agree on Swift Solution to EU Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder agreed here
Wednesday on the need for a "very swift" solution to the
leadership crisis at the European Commission, the executive body
of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
As EU duty president, Schroeder came here to brief D'Alema on
next week's special EU summit in Berlin on Agenda 2000 reform.
However, following Monday's resignation of the EU executive,
Wednesday's talks between the two leaders were dominated by the
crisis in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The president of European Commission, Jacques Santer, resigned
along with his 20 commissioners on Monday night after a report on
mismanagement, fraud and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after their meeting, D'Alema reiterated
that Italy's prime candidate for the post of European Commission
president remained ex-premier Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
"We strongly support the candidacy of Romano Prodi both for the
esteem we have for him personally and because this is a reasonable
objective for Italy," D'Alema added.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor, who has been on a whirlwind tour of EU
capitals, said that the EU government leaders he has spoken to so
far have all agreed on the need for a swift solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He added that for the moment his efforts were not focused on
any specific name for the chief post, but said that the
speculation over two possible German candidates, former chancellor
Helmut Kohl and ex-finance minister Oskar La Fontaine, was pure
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also said that his talks with D'Alema were "very
confidential" and refused to reveal the details of their talks,
saying that he must remain neutral because of his role as the duty
president.
</P>
<P>
Turning his attention to the reform of EU budget and finances
to prepare for its expansion, D'Alema told the press that their
meeting had represented a "step forward."
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor praised D'Alema for playing a "positive
role" in the Agenda 2000 talks, and expressed his hope that the
Berlin summit on March 24-25 would have "true justice" for all EU
members.
</P>
<P>
At that summit, he added, the EU must "demonstrate an ability
to act" and reach an agreement on Agenda 2000.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with D'Alema, Schroeder left here for Lisbon,
where he will continue his Europe tour which will also take him
Thursday to Madrid and Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italy's former Prime Minister Romano Prodi on
Wednesday declined to comment on reports that he was in the
running for the president of European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Members of Prodi's entourage said the situation was still "too
fluid," with the EU engaged in finalizing Agenda 2000 reforms.
</P>
<P>
EU duty chief Schroeder has ruled out a re-appointment of
Santer, but said some of the commissioners may keep their jobs,
especially the ones that did not receive censure in the report.

<HEADLINE> Germany Rules Out EU Commission Head Naming at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking German official
Wednesday ruled out the possibility that a new president of the
European Union (EU) Commission would be named at the EU's Berlin
summit scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Guenter Verheugen, deputy foreign minister responsible for
European affairs, told the Deutschlandfunk radio that Germany's
top priority for the summit was to win an accord with its EU
partners over the Agenda 2000 reform package.
</P>
<P>
Serving as the EU's rotating president for the first half of
year 1999, Bonn has been expecting EU countries to pass the reform
plan, which covers budget, farming and aid spending of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Verheugen said it remained a problem to name a new commission
president before the European Parliament election on June 13 while
it was unclear what sort of majority would emerge from the vote.
</P>
<P>
After the mass resignation of the EU Commission Monday,
Luxemburg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Junke told the press that
a new executive should be named prior to the European Parliament
election, indicating differences among EU members.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Steel Quota Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed Wednesday a bill imposing quotas on steel
imports despite the objections of Republican leaders and the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed 289-141, won considerable support from
Republicans with large steel constituencies but faces an uncertain
future in the Senate. President Bill Clinton has threatened to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
The country's steel imports reached record highs last year as
the Asian economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and
forced foreign producers to turn to the United States to unload
their goods. The U.S. steel industry contends the import surge has
resulted in thousands of U.S. layoffs and three company
bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has faced difficult choices about how exactly
to respond to the import surge. While labor is an important
Democratic constituency, the administration fears that trade
restrictions would encourage other countries to close off their
markets to U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
The steel bill would establish quotas that would essentially
reduce shipments of foreign steel by 25 percent. Imports have been
already heading down since late last year as the government
threatened to impose punitive tariffs on steel products from
Japan, Brazil and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Top Republicans, who agreed to consider the bill only after a
threat of procedural disruptions by its supporters, urged the
measure's defeat, calling it a violation of international trade
agreements and bad economic policy.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, 40 times more American workers are employed in
the U.S. industries that use steel than in industries that
actually make steel," said Representative David Dreier, a
Republican from California. "When we use protectionism to protect
one industry, 40 times the workers are injured."
</P>
<P>
Critics also say the quotas could hurt some manufacturers by
cutting off the supply of specialized products available only
through imports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. industry recently won preliminary rulings on its
complaints that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally dumped
hot-rolled carbon steel in the U.S. market at prices dramatically
below production costs. Japan and Brazil face steel tariffs,
although Russia has agreed to reduce its imports to avoid tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Denies Providing Base for Flights over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In letters to the U.N. Secretary-General and to the President
of the Security Council, Saudi Arabia's U.N. charge d'affaires,
Abdulrahman al-Ahmed, said Iraq's allegations about the use of
Saudi territory by U.S. and British aircraft "are completely
gratuitous and unfounded."
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes patrol no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq and carry out almost daily attacks on Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to reaffirm that the liability for such damage falls
squarely on the Iraqi Government, whose policies of aggression
led to the adoption of international resolutions and measures
based on the international legal order," al-Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary-General on February 12,
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said Iraq reserved the
right to seek compensation "both from the aggressor countries
and from those countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Turkey
that facilitate the aggression and participate in it by making
their air bases available for use" by attacking aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahmed denounced the "fallaciousness of the statements" in
the Iraqi letter, which he said "do not contain the slightest
particle of truth."

<P>
NEW YORK, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Down Jones industrial
average moved down Wednesday a day after briefly breaking the
10,000 milestone.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Dow fell 51.06 at 9,879.41, nearly
121 points away from 10,000. The index crossed the five digit
milestone briefly, then turned back and closed with a loss of
28.30 points Tuesday
</P>
<P>
The Dow's decline came as a result of higher interests in the
bond market. The 30-year Treasury bond was down 5/16 point at
midday, pushing its yield to just under 5.5 percent from 5.47
percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

index fell 10.30 at 2,428.97.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Newspaper Has Fundamental Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)'s
newspaper L'Humanite will from Thursday present itself with a
totally new face in both forms and contents, signaling a
fundamental transformation to survive market competition.
</P>
<P>
The PCF National Secretary Robert Hue told Xinhua at a
reception of L'Huma at the Stade de France football stadium in
Saint Denis outside Paris that the newspaper will remain
Communist, although it will not be the exclusive carrier of the
views of the PCF.
</P>
<P>
The new graphics of L'Huma are designed by Claude Maggiori, who
also designed the daily Liberation in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The L'Huma will be a colorful newspaper instead of having
monotonous red and black printings.
</P>
<P>
The sickle and hammer insignia indicating the PCF ownership
will be removed.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper will abandon its old headings of pages on
domestic and international news, and will concentrate reportings
on some major events of the day and give more space to debates and
special subjects like cities, labor and tendency.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the transformation, the chief editor of L'Huma Claude
Cabanes said that he was worried that the newspaper would not be
able to survive long if it failed to have a radical
transformation.
</P>
<P>
Because of its strong partisanship, the newspaper's circulation
dropped from 106,000 in 1988 to 52,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The reform of L'Huma began to be elaborated two years ago when
the newspaper director Pierre Zarka decided to give a new style to
its weekly periodical L'Huma Hebdo to draw buyers.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the leftwing newspaper was hit itself by a series
of social disputes between its employees and the management over
the past two years because of its deteriorating economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the newspaper of PCF goes parallel with the
reform of the election campaign strategy of the PCF for the
European Parliament elections to be held on June 13.
</P>
<P>
The PCF presented a list of candidates half of whom are not PCF
members to counter the rising influence of the Greens and
extreme-leftist parties.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Invites KLA Leader to Washington for Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States has invited
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) leader Hashim Thaqi to Washington
for advice on how to transform the guerrilla army into a political
movement, the State Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The invitation was issued in Paris earlier in the day at a time
when the peace talks on Kosovo was deadlocked because Yugoslavia
would not agree to NATO's entrance into its sovereign territory of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the invitation to Thaqi and the KLA goes one step
further, by honoring a separatist guerrilla movement that has not
always respected the conventional rules of war.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley, asked about the
rationale behind the visit, said: "We want to develop a good
relationship with them as they transform themselves into a
politically oriented organization under a Kosovo living in peace,
under the terms of the interim accord."
</P>
<P>
"We want to develop closer and better ties with that
organization," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we have a lot of advice and a lot of help that
we can provide to them if they become precisely the kind of
political actor we would like to see them," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
The invitation to Thaqi comes directly from U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, who took a liking to him at their first
meeting in Rambouillet in France last month.

WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Wednesday that it was considering a new donation of food aid to
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) that could be
decided shortly.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to evaluate a further response and announce our
decision as soon as it's made," State Department spokesman James
Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Foley's remarks came a day after the United States and the DPRK
reached an agreement Tuesday to allow U.S. experts to enter the
Kumchang-ri area where Washington was suspicious of an underground
site to be used for a nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
Foley also said the U.N. World Food Program was expected to
make another appeal for emergency food assistance for the DPRK
later this year and the United States would respond to that
request as well.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Sees New Hope of Peace in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. envoy Wednesday
said that he has "a new sense of hope" in Africa because "yearning
for hope is very strong."
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, U.N. special representative for children and
armed conflict, told a press conference of his just-concluded
visit to Africa, which took him to Rwanda, Burundi and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said that he returned to the U.N. headquarters "with a
new sense of hope, especially with local people, especially (after
spending some time) with women and children in the three
countries, their yearnings for peace are very strong."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Rwanda, he also met with Ernest Wamba Dia
Wamba, chairman of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RDC), who
responded positively to several issues raised by Otunnu concerning
the protection and welfare of children, including the recruitment
and use of children in armed conflict and the protection of
civilian populations.
</P>
<P>
Wamba traveled from Goma, eastern Congo (K), to meet with the
U.N. special representative in Gisenyi, Rwanda, on February 22.
</P>
<P>
Wamba made the commitment to a temporary cease-fire in response
to the U.N. envoy's call for a respite in fighting in order to
allow for vaccinations and the special feeding of malnourished
children in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
"I am encouraged by the positive response and commitments I
have received from Mr. Wamba. I look forward to following through
on these commitments and to urging the RDC (the Democratic
Republic of Congo) to translate them into concrete actions that
can provide greater protection to children exposed to armed
conflict in the DRC," said Otunnu.
</P>
<P>
The special representative said he, in his visit to the three
African nations, has expressed grave concern over the growing
trend towards the targeting of civilian populations in a situation
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said he visited Burundi "just a couple days after the
end of sanctions against the country," where he can see for
himself the impact on children of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He said he also sought ways by which the issue of protection
and the needs of children could be incorporated into the Burundi
peace process now going on in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy had already raised the issue with former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who had in principle accepted
and welcomed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has appointed Otunnu as his
special representative for children in armed conflict. The
three-year-term appointment was announced on August 19, 1997 and
effective on September 1, 1997. He has since served as advocate
for children in armed conflict situations, promoting measures for
their protection in times of conflict and for their healing and
reintegration in conflict's aftermath.

<HEADLINE> UN Security Council Hails Intra-Afghan Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Wednesday welcomed the intra-Afghan talks
which were held on March 11 to 14, 1999, in Ashgabat,
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council was briefed this
morning on the talks between Afghanistan's warring factions the
Taleban and the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Council President for the current month
Qin Huasun said members of the Council viewed the Ashgabat talks
as a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
Qin said Council members expressed the hope that the parties
would continue their negotiations in order to achieve agreement on
specific questions relating to an intra-Afghan settlement, in
particular on a cease-fire, on the creation of a broad based and
fully representative government acceptable to all Afghans.
</P>
<P>
Qin said Members of the Council reaffirmed their support for
the efforts of the United Nations, and particular those of the
Special Envoy of the U.N. Secretary-General for Afghanistan,
Lakhdar Brahimi, to promote a political settlement of the Afghan
conflict on the basis of the relevant resolutions of the United
Nations General Assembly and the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Council welcomed the intention of the U.N.
Secretary-General to calibrate the gradual limited return of UN
staff to the country in accordance with the security concern and
noted the importance of equal distribution of humanitarian
assistance among the population of all the regions in Afghanistan
as permitted by security conditions, Qin added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks which were broked by the United Nations, the
warring factions in Afghanistan have agreed in principle on the
creation of a coalition government to include all of the country's
political forces.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first such deal between the factions, could
mean an end to two decades of fighting in the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Says Further Economic Gains in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The strong economic growth of
1998 brought the new year with robust consumer spending, brisk
construction activity and increasing demand for labor, the U.S.
Federal Reserve said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, prices of most goods remain little changed and
businesses remain reluctant to press for price increases, the Fed
said in a survey of regional economic conditions before March 8,
known as the "Beige Book."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the combination of thriving economic growth and
absent inflation detected in the survey implies Fed policy-makers
probably will opt for no change in interest rates when they meet
on March 30.
</P>
<P>
The Beige Book, a compilation of anecdotal information
collected by the Fed's 12 regional banks, confirmed statistical
reports showing the economy maintained its vigor through January
and February despite continuing problems in agriculture,
manufacturing and energy production.
</P>
<P>
The book said that even in manufacturing, where some companies
have struggled with exports lost to the world economic slowdown
that began in Asia in 1997, there are some improvements in most
districts.
</P>
<P>
Six banks of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Va., St. Louis,
Minneapolis and San Francisco reported stronger manufacturing and
five banks of Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas
reported mixed conditions. Only one, Kansas City Bank, said
manufacturing remained weak.
</P>
<P>
Though "foreign competition depressed textile, apparel and
energy-related industries," the survey said, "post-holiday
discounting and mild weather in some regions" contributed to
continued strength in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
It said, "motor vehicle sales increased, led by light trucks,
and furniture sales benefited from robust home sales."
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, however, "continued to be plagued by low farm
commodity prices, and an increasing number of farmers were under
financial stress," the survey said. Also, three districts --
Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco -- "reported that
falling oil prices were causing some oil and gas wells to be
withdrawn from production.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Beige Book said, the overall economy
retained its vigor and "labor markets remained tight."
</P>
<P>
"Finding qualified workers has become more difficult in several
districts, and reports of faster wage increases were more
widespread than in recent months," it said. And in the New York
and Kansas City districts, even "finding entry-level workers was
difficult."

LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- Main European stock markets closed
lower after the Dow continued its decline from Tuesday, when it
touched the 10,000-point mark only for a while.
</P>
<P>
London's blue chips FTSE 100 carried on from where it left off
in the last session, failing to make any headway. The index fell
almost 1 percent, shedding 61 points to close at 6,140.6.
</P>
<P>
"It's been a thin day volume wise, and we'd have needed the Dow
above 10,000 to force a FTSE recovery," said one trader from a

</P>
<P>
Even strong hints from the Bank of England that it is
considering further interest rate cuts failed to stir investors.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's thinking was revealed in minutes from its

In Frankfurt, the leading shares fell back again after a brief

Xetra Dax index ended 0.56 percent lower at 5,062.59, a drop of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Threat of Military Action on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that NATO is "prepared to act" if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic refuses to let it enforce peace in the
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We're obviously very concerned about what we're seeing in
terms of military movements by Serbia. It's a matter of serious
concern to us and it's something that the Serbs have heard
directly from us about our concerns," said White House deputy
National Security Adviser James Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia on Tuesday asked a substantive changes to a
U.S.-drafted peace deal on Kosovo, which was, however, rejected
by the so-called Contact Group that presided over the peace
talks in Paris between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have agreed to sign the peace deal and the
talks were deadlocked as the Serbs refused to let foreign troops
in their sovereign territory of Kosovo as NATO had demanded.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said NATO's patience was growing thin, and repeated
warning of bombing Yugoslav targets if Belgrade does not give up
its sovereignty in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The president has made very clear that if Serbian
intransigence and continued aggression causes this peace effort
to fail, there will be consequences, and we are watching it very
closely," Steinberg told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He threatened Yugoslavia that "NATO has authority to act." He
added NATO is "prepared to act" if Milosevic continue to refuse
the peace deal and move his troops in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said that based on
reports from international monitors, the Serbs continued moving
reinforcements into Kosovo overnight.
</P>
<P>
Foley called the troop movements a "clear violation" of last
October's agreement between Milosevic and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Steinberg and Foley said there were two triggers for NATO
military action -- a refusal by the Serbs to agree to the
drafted Kosovo peace deal, and an armed offensive against the
Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"And on both scores, we are seeing increasing evidence that
the Serbs are meeting the criteria for triggering a NATO
response," Foley said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Conference to Continue Thursday in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The conference on Kosovo will
continue Thursday and the Kosovo Albanian delegation will sign the
peace agreement before leaving Paris, said the three international
mediators Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Union representative, Austrian diplomat Wolfgang
Petritsch, said that the Kosovo Albanian delegation will sign the
agreement without any delay.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Serb delegation still is not ready to sign the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the conference on Kosovo is drawing to an end
and in order to obtain a positive result and a complete agreement,
the international mediators will accelerate the talks with the
Yugoslav side.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill gave a more pessimistic tone,
saying that the Serb side failed to make any "new progress" in the
past three days of talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Kosovo Albanian side has agreed to sign the
agreement as it has been required to do, while it is not the case
for the other side of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Russian mediator Boris Mayorski refused to hold the Serb side
responsible for the deadlock of the conference, but said that only
one signature will not make up an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"There should be two to dance the tango," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mayorski said that as long as there is time and hope, the
international mediators will continue to work.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation has stood firm in its opposition to the
deployment of a NATO force in Kosovo, which the Western countries
said will guarantee the implementation of the peace agreement on
autonomy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav delegation has also demanded that some amendments
be made in the political part of the agreement, as some articles
will undermine Serb sovereignty over Kosovo.

<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) formally expelled six members at its 108th
session held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The six who have been expelled are Agustin C. Arroyo of
Ecuador, Zein El Abdin A. Gadir of Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of
Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali, Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile,
and Paul Wallwork of Samoa.
</P>
<P>
The expulsions of the first five were recommended on January 24
by the IOC ad hoc commission to investigate the conduct of certain
IOC members involved in the bidding process of the Winter Olympic
games in the Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
Wallwork was added to the recommendation when the ad hoc
commission presented its second report to the IOC executive board
on March 11.
</P>
<P>
A total of 10 delegates, almost 10 percent of the membership,

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Children Should Be Protected From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The world has been far
from tranquillity since the beginning of this year, the last one
in the outgoing century. Gunshots have been heard in conflicts in
such countries as Afghanistan, Angola, Congo (K), Guinea-Bissau,
Liberia and Sierra Leone, and many children have been victimized
in these intra-state conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an alarming trend has been the increasing
participation, direct and indirect, of children in armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that up to 300,000 children under the age of
18 are serving as combatants in government armed forces or armed
opposition groups in ongoing conflicts," Olara Otunnu, special
representative of the U.N. secretary-general for children and
armed conflicts, has said.
</P>
<P>
This brutal reality has been exacerbated by a qualitative
change in the nature and scope of conflict in recent times.
Today's conflicts are primarily internal, often fought by
multiple, semi-autonomous armed groups within existing state
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Against a backdrop of increasingly accessible and destructive
conventional weapons, many of these conflicts pit compatriot
against compatriot, neighbor against neighbor.
</P>
<P>
In today's internecine warfare, the village has become the
battlefield and civilian populations are the primary target. The
driving force behind the tragic scene is what has been described
as "military adventurism," the warring parties seek to test their
fortune on the battlefield, and one government send troops to
fight in another country.
</P>
<P>
Millions of children and women, those most vulnerable and least
responsible for conflict, today represent the vast majority of
casualties in armed conflicts worldwide. About 90 percent of all
victims today are civilians, mostly children and women and mostly
in internecine wars.
</P>
<P>
In about 50 countries worldwide, millions of children today are
either swept up in armed conflicts or suffering in their
aftermath. Not only are they the victims of war, but all too often
they are its principle targets. In far too many cases, these
targets of war also become its instruments -- serving as child
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million children have been killed in the decade
from 1987 to 1997. At the same time, at least 6 million have been
maimed or permanently disabled. At least 1 million children have
been orphaned during the same 10-year period and half, or 11.4
million, of the world's refugees and displaced persons are
children. Some 300,000 children under 18 are soldiers, guerrillas
or their servants.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, illegal proliferation of light and small weapons
has made it easier for children to be recruited as soldiers
fighting in the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
It is often said that children represent the future of human
civilization and the future of every society. Indeed, to permit
them to be used as pawns in warfare, whether as targets or
perpetrators, is to cast a shadow on the future.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the international community has an obligation to be
concerned about the protection of all non-combatants caught in the
midst of violent conflicts. Yet there is an urgent need to focus
special attention on the plight of children.
</P>
<P>
However, words on paper cannot save children in peril. The
international community should make concrete steps to protect
children affected by armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
For its part, the United Nations has increasingly sought to
draw international attention to the plight of children in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Particularly, specific measures have to be taken to protect the
children affected by armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
First, efforts should be made to end the participation of
children in armed conflict and end their recruitment as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The international community should step up pressure for
demobilization and reintegration, and raise the legal age of
recruitment from 15 to 18. In other words, no one under 15 should
carry arms.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, efforts should be made to reduce the impact of light
weapons on children. This means painstaking efforts to contain the
illegal smuggling of light and small weapons, particularly the
spread of such weapons into conflict-torn regions.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, efforts should be made to assess and redress the
impact of sanctions on children. Children have been groaning in
the wake of sanctions, which have denied them the access to
fundamental food, not to mention sufficient nutrition. In Iraq,
many children died before they reached the age of 5 simply because
of the nine-year sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the international community should also make efforts to
promote mine awareness and the rehabilitation of child victims,
and help the societies concerned to end the rape and sexual abuse
of children during armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
In short, international and national actors must take necessary
political, economic and social measures to prevent conflicts by
addressing the glaring imbalances within societies. Building
genuine democratic practice and respect for the rule of law are
essential because they provide regularized and non-violent
mechanisms to mediate competing claims that can lead to conflict.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Asked to Decide Fate of Khmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan asked Wednesday the Security Council or the General
Assembly to decide the fate of Khmer Rouge leaders, emphasizing
that cooperation from the Cambodian government is essential.
</P>
<P>
"The decision on the establishment of an international
tribunal, whether under Chapter VI or VII of the Charter of the
United Nations, is for the Security Council or the General
Assembly to make," said the U.N. chief in a letter addressed to
the two U.N. organs.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general was submitting a report filed by a
three-member fact-finding team sent to Cambodian to probe into
the feasibility of trying the Khmer Rouge leaders before an
international or national tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The team was acting upon the request from the Cambodian
government headed by then Second Prime Minister Hun Sen for
assistance in bringing to justice Khmer Rouge leaders. However,
Phnom Penh has now insisted they be tried before a national
court.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nambong last week made it
clear that since the Khmer Rouge leaders and the victims of
genocide are all Cambodian, the court has to be in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nambong met the secretary-general for half an hour to
clarify his government's stand. However, it seemed that he
failed to convince Annan of the need to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
"I reminded the foreign minister that the Group of Experts
had carefully considered the feasibility of a national tribunal,
but concluded that the Cambodian judiciary in its current state
was unlikely to meet minimal international standards of justice,
even with external assistance," the U.N. chief said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that if the international standards of justice,
fairness and the process of law are to be met, "the tribunal in
question must be international in character."
</P>
<P>
However, Annan stressed that this doesn't mean that it should
be modelled after either of the existing ad hoc tribunals or be
linked to them institutionally, administratively or financially.
</P>
<P>
"Other options may be explored, taking into account the
analysis and conclusions of the Group of Experts," the U.N.
chief said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
Annan realized that the success of any international tribunal
of whatever character, depends on the full cooperation of the
Cambodian government and its readiness to apprehend the Khmer Rouge
leaders situated in its territory.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the 15-nation Security Council will
take up the issue for deliberation at Annan's request, but it is
unclear when and where it will lead to.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to tell what will turn out at this stage since the
Security Council members would have to study the report carefully
before making up their mind," said an Asian diplomat, who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
China has said that it would respect the decision by the
Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Russia would probably adopt a similar
stand on this matter, while France is taking a position different
from the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Washington and London are believed to be the main driving
force for an international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly will be asked to make a decision if the
Security Council fails. But its resolution, if any, will not be
binding, the diplomat said.

<HEADLINE> Top UK Finance Groups On Target For Year 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The great majority of Britain's
leading financial groups are on course to beat the Millennium Bug,
but there are a few in danger of not achieving Year 2000
compliance in time.
</P>
<P>
This was the theme of a report by Michael Foot, managing
director of financial supervision at the Financial Services
Authority (FSA), to a conference here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foot gave a detailed analysis of the financial sector's Year
2000 readiness based mainly on the FSA's "Traffic Light"
assessment of information received from financial firms.
</P>
<P>
Foot said, "For High Impact groups, where problems could have a
big effect on retail customers or the markets, our assessment
shows around 58 percent are on track for Year 2000 compliance
(`blue').
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five percent behind but likely to get on track
(`amber') and less than 8 percent (12 in number) pose a serious
risk (`red')."
</P>
<P>
"For Medium Impact groups, the overall position is that 40
percent are on track (`blue'), 45 percent behind (`amber') and 15
percent serious risk (`red')," he added.
</P>
<P>
The figures come with a number of qualifications, according to
the report. However, the FSA cannot check all the information
supplied by the many firms it supervises, the report said.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Starts To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The rapid slowdown in the UK
economy has finally hit the job market with unemployment rising
for the first time in six months.
</P>
<P>
The official figures released by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) Wednesday, showed jobless numbers rising 4,300 to
1,311,000 in February.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the data would soothe inflation fears and pile
further pressure on the Bank of England to cut lending rates again
to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, when looking at the other side of the coin, the total
number of people in jobs has also risen, to 27.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The apparent contradiction in the figures is explained by the
fact that the total workforce is expanding allowing rises in both
employed and unemployed.
</P>
<P>
ONS figures for earnings growth show wages rising 4.3 percent
in the three months to January over the same period a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Both the job and wage figures raise hopes of another cut in
interest rates in April, showing that the UK's economic slowdown
has begun to bite hard.

<HEADLINE> Annan Woos Positive Investment in African Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday called on the non-governmental
organizations and private sectors to make positive investment in
forest management in Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Forest protection is an essential investment in the future
well-being of people and the planet," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the statement in a message to the opening of the
Central African Forest Summit in Yaounde, Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
"This summit must decide what to do to reverse the trend of the
degradation of tropical forests in the region," he said. "Never
before has there been such a coordinated and concerted regional
effort to come to grips with the wide range of issues involved."
</P>
<P>
"This summit can help us make the necessary adjustments, and
point us in the proper direction: towards implementation of forest
laws to reduce illegal logging; towards tax reforms and other
changes in economic policy that promote sustainable forest
management; towards national and local capacity-building,
particularly in the area of human resources; and towards improved
coordination of international forest assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The forest system of Central Africa is the world's second
largest contiguous expanse of moist tropical forest," he said,
"Its direct economic contribution to the region's economy is
significant: more than 8 percent of foreign exchanges earnings, a
considerable share of total exports and substantial share of total
government revenue."
</P>
<P>
Annan said he has "every confidence" that scientists and
governments in Central Africa "will rise to the challenge and
pledge the support of the United Nations" for relevant efforts.
</P>
<P>
Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the United Nations
Environment Program, delivered the message on behalf of Annan at
the summit, which opened on Wednesday in Cameroon.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Attorney General Opposes Independent Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno told Congress Wednesday that she dropped her earlier support
for the independent counsel law after seeing her decisions on some
cases "plunged into the political process."
</P>
<P>
Reno appeared before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
to oppose extending the law governing independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department reversed course in recent weeks to
oppose another five-year renewal of the law. Earlier this month,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder testified in opposition to an
extension.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that when she became attorney general, "I didn't
account for the focus and the immediate posture of any decision I
made, to see it plunged into the political process."
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to a House panel on March 2, Holder emphasized
that the administration's new opposition was not based on
"problems with individual independent counsels," such as Kenneth
Starr, whose five-year investigation of President Bill Clinton led
to the second presidential impeachment in history.
</P>
<P>
He said the law "comes dangerously close to tipping the
traditional balance of fairness in the conduct of criminal
investigations and prosecutions" by insulating independent
counsels from financial accountability and traditional Justice
Department rules.
</P>
<P>
The law is set to expire on June 30. It is widely disliked by
members of both parties in Congress after independent counsel
investigations of Republican and Democratic presidents and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
If Congress lets the law expire, as it did in 1992 before
renewing it 18 months later, dozens of high-ranking government
officials who now could be subject to an independent counsel
inquiry would be investigated instead by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has administered the law since its
beginning in 1978. It gives the attorney general a framework for
recommending that an outside investigator take over inquiries into
certain high-level White House and other government figures.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Cuts Daily Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 17 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian National Corporation
of Oil Products announced on Wednesday it will cut down its oil
production by 57,000 barrels per day as from next April.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the firm was quoted by the Algerian News
Agency as saying the move is in response to the Hague accord
signed on Friday between OPEC members and other oil producing
countries to reduce oil production by 2.1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
"The decision shows Algeria's full respect for its commitments
to the OPEC," Director General of the company Abdul-Meguid Attar
said.
</P>
<P>
The output cut will cover all of the country's productive
oilfields particularly those operating with foreign partners, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The efforts "proved to be fruitful in leading to the oil
production cut by 1.7 million barrels a day for a whole year as
from April," said Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines Youcef
Yousfi on Tuesday, who is currently chief of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Oman will cut its production by 63,000 barrels a
day, Mexico by 125,000 barrels and Norway by 100,000
barrels. Russia is expected to declare its quota later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The oil prices are expected to hit 18 U.S. dollars per barrel
by the end of this year, said the OPEC official.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's current quota in the OPEC stands at 788,000 barrels a
day.

</P>
<P>
The U.S. House takes up a similar version Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Senate passage came after the Clinton administration Tuesday
dropped a long-standing veto threat, saying several amendments had
made the measure more palatable.
</P>
<P>
One of those stressed a continued U.S. commitment to seeking
nuclear arms reductions with the Russians. Opponents had suggested
the original measure would have violated restrictions on a missile
defense in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
</P>
<P>
With passage of the legislation assured, senators had spent
most of the day skirmishing over political considerations, with
Republicans accusing President Clinton and congressional Democrats
of an 11-hour conversion.
</P>
<P>
Republicans welcomed the belated support of the administration
and its Democratic allies -- but questioned the timing.
</P>
<P>
The president "should pick his fights with Congress on foreign
policy issues" more carefully, claimed Republican Senator John
Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He said
the debate over missile defense should have been resolved earlier
and that Clinton's slowness to recognize this set back development
of such a system.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the U.S. legislation and deployment of the
National Missile Defense System will not only violate terms of the
1972 ABM treaty, but also aggravate international arms race, thus
affecting world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Join Hands to Fight Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 17 (Xinhua) -- An international organization,
Task Force, was established in Nairobi Wednesday with an aim to
fight wildlife crimes in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is the first inter-governmental organization on wildlife
protection in the world, which is composed of law enforcement
officials from Republic of Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Tanzania,
Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Task Force functions under the Lusaka Agreement on
Cooperative Enforcement Operations directed at Illegal Trade in
Wild Fauna and Flora, signed in the Zambian capital in 1994. The
objective of the agreement is to reduce and ultimately eliminate
illegal trade in wildlife.
</P>
<P>
So far the six countries have adopted the agreement which
entered into force in 1996. The establishment of the Task
Force will strengthen the effectiveness of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES).
</P>
<P>
The governing council of the Lusaka Agreement, consisting of
officials from the six countries, have been meeting at Kenya
Wildlife Service headquarters since Monday with the objective of
making the Task Force fully operational. Also present at the
meeting were observers from CITES and the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
The Task Force was the idea of a group of wildlife law
enforcement officers from African countries who met in Lusaka in
1992. They stressed at the meeting the need for international
cooperation in order to fight wildlife crime successfully.
</P>
<P>
The national bureaux of the organization will work together
with their headquarters on joint cross-border operations against
wildlife crime. The director, intelligence officer and supporting
staff are expected to be appointed in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho have made contributions to the
budget of the Task Force. The Kenyan government offered free
office accommodation.
