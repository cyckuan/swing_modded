PUBLIC SEEMS TO BE TAKING A VACATION FROM Y2K WORRIES, EXPERTS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Go ahead, grill those burgers and then take a
little nap in the hammock. The last thing you want to worry about
is Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   After all, you're thinking, the problem is far away and besides,
it's almost fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, say experts who are beginning to worry that the summer
vacation that people are taking from Y2K will cost us all later. In
fact, a survey of 337 Y2K professionals released Thursday shows
most experts still are concerned about the impact of the computer
bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's summer and we're trying to chill out and relax,'' says Ed
Yardeni, a leading Y2K expert with Deutsche Bank Securities in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, the complacency on Y2K will persist right through
the summer,'' he said. ``We're almost getting lazy. It's a Greek
tragedy in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fear that the public, by snoozing now, will wake up too
late to make calm and common-sense preparations.
</P>
<P>
   And almost everyone agrees that interest in Y2K has dropped off
the chart.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Vera Jr., generator sales manager at Cummins Onan
Mid-America in Kansas City, received 20 calls a week through March.
Now, he gets about six calls a week from people looking to purchase
5,000- to 6,000-watt home generators.
</P>
<P>
   Banker Larry Kucinick of NationsBank Kansas City says there have
been no takers in a week-old Small Business Administration Y2K loan
program to provide $5,000 to $25,000 loans for vulnerable small
companies.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the number of people attending local Y2K forums,
Dean Katerndahl, head of the Mid-America Regional Council's
Government Innovations Forum, also senses a lull.
</P>
<P>
   The same phenomenon is occurring nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet survey in May of 100 grass-roots activists in 28
states shows the ``pendulum is unmistakably swinging toward apathy
and complacency,'' said Liza Christian, former director of the
Rogue Valley Y2K Task Force in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the country's most recognized Y2K trackers has
taken himself out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long, hot, quiet summer of Y2K denial,''
said ``Timebomb 2000'' author and 30-year computer expert Ed
Yourdon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is moving into the Y2K end game with the prevailing
attitude that government and industry are in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every industry has forecast certain victory over the
computer bug in recent months, but often without independent,
third-party verification of their claims, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read them carefully, it's quite clear they're putting
an awful lot of positive spin on the positive news and not putting
any negative spin on the negative news,'' Yardeni said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the American Hospital Association released a
statement two months ago that it was ``confident'' all hospitals
would meet the Y2K deadline, even though only 13 percent were
actually Y2K-compliant at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have issued confusing pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   After warning last fall of potential disaster, the President's
Year 2000 Conversion Council began sounding more optimistic, saying
that industry had heeded the forecast and gone to work. John
Koskinen, chairman of the council, then began issuing Y2K
statements using phrases such as ``all is well'' and ``don't
worry.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the co-chairmen of the Senate Special
Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem were sounding much
more dire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y2K is one of the most serious and potentially devastating
events this nation has ever encountered,'' according to a joint
statement in March from Sen. Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican, and
Sen. Christoper Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said in an interview this week that he never meant to
put a glossy spin on Y2K. The problem, he says, is that the message
is complex: National systems such as the power grid,
telecommunications network and air-traffic control are safe, but
people should be prepared for some localized disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 337 Y2K professionals released Thursday by the
Washington D.C. Year 2000 Group shows that many experts still worry
about the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Total responses to all the poll questions show 45 percent think
computer problems will have a ``significant impact,'' according to
the group, while 10 percent think it will be ``the end of the world
as we know it.'' The remaining 45 percent think Y2K is going to be
a ``bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a poll taken by USA Today in March showed that 78
percent of the public expected no problems or only minor problems
because of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, who continues to believe the computer glitch is likely
to cause a 70 percent chance of worldwide recession, senses the
public optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, people want to believe that Y2K will be a
complete and total non-event,'' he said. ``We have gone from
fearing the worst to assuming the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that may be explained by how people process information,
says Allan Hanson, a cultural anthropologist at the University of
Kansas. The steady drumbeat of Y2K news is beginning to take its
toll on public attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people hear the same message over and over again,'' he
said, ``they tune it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson, as well Yardeni and Yourdon, all agree the public will
begin paying attention again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: By that time, it may be difficult to calmly plan
and obtain all the items that organizations such as the American
Red Cross say you should set aside for the days following Jan. 1.
Unpredictable surges in last-minute demand could create chaos in
supply lines and inventories, they say.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, drug suppliers, grocers, bankers and discount retailers
all fear their biggest problems may not come from their computers,
but from the ensuing panic from those who have not outlined a Y2K
game plan.

SPEAKER WILL ADVOCATE LESS COSTLY, MORE PERSONALIZED FUNERALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When the husband of national consumer
advocate Lisa Carlson died in 1981, local authorities in Vermont
had trouble coping with her insistence that she would handle the
details herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they asked which funeral home I was using, I told them to
bring the body back to the house. ... They were flabbergasted,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But they finally did as Carlson requested, she said, because the
law allowed it _ and still does in many states.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which had little money at the time, saved thousands
of dollars by forgoing standard expenses for embalming, a casket,
and other funeral and burial costs, Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   She transported the body herself _ in a pickup truck _ to a
local crematorium, and later held an open house and memorial
gathering at the family home.
</P>
<P>
   The experience set Carlson on a new career path as writer,
advocate and, for the past three years, executive director of the
Funeral and Memorial Society of America.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson will be in Kansas City on Sunday to deliver a free
lecture. She will discuss federal laws and state laws in Kansas and
Missouri, and how consumers can protect themselves from what she
says are typical funeral industry abuses, including high prices and
manipulative sales tactics that are difficult to resist while
grieving.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson's latest book, Caring for the Dead: Your Final Act of
Love, will be available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The 600-page book has chapters on each of the 50 states'
requirements regarding death.
</P>
<P>
   Other chapters explore issues such as burial on private
property, organ donation, funeral packages purchased in advance,
cemeteries and federal consumer-rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said there was growing awareness of consumer rights as
well as a budding do-it-yourself funeral movement in recent years,
especially among baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the generation that wrote their own wedding vows, did
natural childbirth and is into homeschooling of their children,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a need to personalize the funeral experience, and
those that do are finding it to be therapeutic and healing.''
</P>
<P>
   And cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson's appearance is sponsored by the Funeral and Memorial
Society of Greater Kansas City, which monitors local funeral home
prices and provides public education on industry issues.

VERDICT IN CANNIBALISM CASE IS SET ASIDE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Albert Fentress, a former Hudson Valley
teacher who tortured, killed and cannibalized a teen-ager 20 years
ago, will remain in a state psychiatric hospital in Suffolk County
despite a jury's decision that he should be set free, a state judge
has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress, 57, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity in
1980 in the killing of the teen-ager, Paul Masters, persuaded
jurors in April that, though he remained mentally ill, he no longer
posed a threat to society and should be treated in a halfway house
with little supervision.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, Justice Harry E. Seidell of state Supreme
Court set aside the jury's decision at the request of lawyers for
the state Office of Mental Health and the Dutchess County district
attorney. Seidell reasoned that the six jurors had acted
irrationally both in accepting and rejecting parts of the testimony
of expert psychiatrists for each side.
</P>
<P>
   The state's experts had said that Fentress remained ill and
continued to need inpatient care, the judge explained, while
Fentress' experts, who included some of his doctors at Pilgrim
State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood, testified that he was no
longer ill and did not require such care.
</P>
<P>
   ``To believe that petitioner was mentally ill but did not need
inpatient care and treatment,'' Seidell said, referring to
Fentress, ``the jury would have to believe that outside the
hospital setting petitioner would somehow, on his own, develop
self-control and not pose a danger to others.''
</P>
<P>
   To appeal, Fentress would first have to seek permission from the
Appellate Division, according to lawyers in the attorney general's
office, which represented the Office of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Fentress' lawyer, Kim L. Darrow, of the state's Mental Hygiene
Legal Service agency, did not respond to telephone messages
Thursday. But Michael L. Perlin, who specializes in mental
disability law at New York Law School, faulted the judge for
failing to explain in his decision why he had dismissed outright
the contention by Fentress' experts that he could be harmless in a
less restrictive setting.
</P>
<P>
   Perlin added that, while the judge's ruling would not set any
binding precedent until it was reviewed by an appellate court, it
could nevertheless unfairly hurt the interests of other mental
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time, in a vivid, well-publicized case, a trial judge
rejects a finding by a jury that a person is fit to be released,
that's going to have a spillover effect,'' he said. ``Other judges
are going to be more reluctant to release patients if there's a
question as to their danger to the community. And juries may not
want to bother finding for patients if they figure their verdicts
are going to be set aside anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But William V. Grady, the Dutchess County district attorney,
said the jury verdict had been ``totally inconsistent'' and
commended the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   In written statements issued Thursday, Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer said Fentress ``still poses a very serious threat to the
public,'' and Gov. George Pataki said the judge's decision ``is a
victory for justice, common sense and the safety of New Yorkers;
simply put, Albert Fentress should not be on the streets of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Spitzer said the case had highlighted the need to
change the laws governing insanity pleas and the confinement of
mentally ill people who have committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Masters, the father of Fentress' victim, said by telephone
from his home in San Jose, Calif., that he still believed that
Fentress was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very relieved for the people in Long Island that they
don't have to worry about Fentress wandering around unsupervised,''
Masters said. ``It'd be a shame to let another tragedy happen when
it could be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters, 69, added that he was ``quite positive'' that Fentress
would eventually be released. ``He's always made aware of just what
he has to do to satisfy all the psychiatrists,'' he said of
Fentress' repeated attempts to gain his freedom in recent years.
``Eventually, he's going to do all the right things and give all
the right answers. I just hope it doesn't happen real soon.''

BUSH WILL COMPETE IN ARIZONA PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the rumors began swirling that presidential front-runner
George W. Bush was planning to give up Arizona without a fight,
Arizona congressman Matt Salmon hopped a flight to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon wanted to get a &UR; feel for the candidate. But he also
wanted to know whether Bush was going to make a genuine push in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked both him and his campaign manager about it, and they
said, `You bet we are (going for Arizona),' '' said Salmon, who
hasn't committed to any candidate but clearly has an eye for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that he is going to invest as much here as he
will in New Hampshire, but I think he takes it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, an Arizona Bush campaign remains a wispy concept
issuing only from the Texas governor's private discourse with
would-be supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has no office or permanent staff members here, also
has promised to make only one personal visit to Arizona between now
and January, according to organizers and fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters acknowledge that his efforts in Arizona may
appear faint compared with those of publishing magnate Steve
Forbes, Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Vice President Dan
Quayle. Still, the latest state poll puts Bush ahead of all
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Forbes launched a multimillion-dollar campaign blitz
focused, in part, on Arizona. McCain has vowed to win his home
state and has vigorously pursued the endorsements of many in the
state's political establishment. And Quayle, who lives with his
wife, Marilyn, in Paradise Valley, has his nationwide headquarters
in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he (Bush) was coming every week, but it just doesn't
make any sense,'' said Gordon James, a local public relations
executive who is among a handful of Phoenix residents laying the
groundwork for Bush in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, they are going to want to concentrate on New
Hampshire and Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're not going to Alaska and Hawaii, either, and in
1992, President Bush didn't ever come to Arizona, though we wish he
had.''
</P>
<P>
   James noted that, unlike other presidential aspirants who have
been kicking up dust on the campaign trail for months, Bush has
remained focused on his duties as governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's front-porch campaign will come to an end this week, when
he will sweep through Iowa and New Hampshire to attend a series of
fund-raisers and campaign events. He will travel in a chartered
commercial-size jet with 150 members of the media in tow.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush's first appearance in Arizona could come in
August after he first stops in California, James said.
Nevertheless, James insisted that the candidate would make a
sincere stab at winning Arizona's Feb. 22 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ceding any states to anybody,'' James said. ``We
need all 50 states, and he'll fight just as hard here as he'll
fight anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Arizona's prominence as an early presidential primary, a
number of political observers are not surprised by Bush's decision
to direct his campaign elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly every poll taken in Arizona, Bush has walloped Quayle
and Forbes and also outdistanced McCain, the state's apparent
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey, a Rocky Mountain Poll, showed Bush edging out
McCain, 30 percent to 26 percent, among Maricopa County
Republicans. Former Red Cross director Elizabeth Dole received 12
percent, Quayle got 11 percent, and Forbes netted 8 percent.
However, the Texas governor's lead was well within the poll's 6.9
percentage-point margin of error.
</P>
<P>
   Given his early strength, which comes without the benefit of a
single campaign appearance, Bush has little incentive to make a
splash here, observed Arizona State University pollster Bruce
Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, in the broader scheme of things for him, this frankly
isn't a very important state, and it is for McCain because it's his
home state and it's just before California,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is doing well in the polls, but there are only 8
electoral votes here, so he would be wise to start with the larger
states and ensure that he is very solid there and move down as he
has the time and resources to do so,'' Merrill addded.
</P>
<P>
   Bush officials have made contact with several rising activists
in the Hispanic community, signaling a desire to tap into the
state's large Hispanic vote and its growing fund-raising base.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Trujillo, a key fund-raiser for Gov. Jane Hull, said the
Bush campaign contacted him recently seeking support.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo said he and several associates will organize a
fund-raising event, yet to be scheduled. Other fund-raisers close
to Hull are expected to wade in for Bush, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when,'' he said of the fledgling effort to
organize for Bush. ``But it's fast materializing.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate was the beneficiary of a fund-raiser in March,
which netted more than $250,000, and a second event in Tucson,
which brought in $85,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin DeMenna, a Phoenix lobbyist who wrote a check for Bush in
March, said the Texas governor's tack may be to take a bye in
Arizona under the assumption that even a second- or third-place
showing would constitute victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bet is that Bush never makes it out of the airport in this
state,'' DeMenna said. ``Why pick a fight if you win by not doing
it?'' &QL;

`WORM' VIRUS MAKES FOR UNPRODUCTIVE DAYS IN MANY OFFICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At 10 a.m. Thursday, Gina Calabria had a hard drive
full of plans, spreadsheets and presentations.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, all of them _ every last Microsoft Office document _
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was `It must be in here somewhere,''' said
the public-relations account supervisor at Seattle's Imagio
Technology Marketing and Communications Inc. ``But it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Calabria was one of hundreds of thousands of computer users
around the world struck by a new virus called Worm.Explore-Zip.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus spread across the Internet Thursday, infecting
machines by e-mail like the recent Melissa virus _ but causing more
damage by ruining computer files.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear how many machines or networks had
been stricken.
</P>
<P>
   The virus _ transmitted as an e-mail attachment to users, and
activated when the attachment is opened _ hit even the world's
largest software maker, Microsoft. The company had to disconnect
its computers for two hours Thursday morning so Microsoft users
wouldn't infect customer computers.
</P>
<P>
   The list of victims in the Seattle area alone was staggering.
Along with Microsoft, The Boeing Co.'s corporate e-mail system was
struck down. MSNBC reported the Worm was wreaking havoc on its
systems. Eastside technology company Attachmate took its e-mail
server off-line by midmorning Thursday and didn't expect it to be
back up until Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic on the Eastside _ where technology companies have
clustered since the 1980s _ was especially heavy Thursday afternoon
as companies crippled by the loss of e-mail collectively threw up
their hands and let workers go home early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who gets to work early,'' said Tiffany
Allesina, Attachmate's spokeswoman. ``I pretty much lost my hard
drive, except for some stuff I backed up last week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The firsthand reports we've gotten come from everything on the
scale from a single user to a systems where hundreds of thousands
of people are affected,'' said Mark Zajicek, a staff member of the
Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Calabria's files were backed up on other computers, she
said. But several documents that hadn't been finished are now gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get an accurate count,'' she said. ``I won't know
until I begin needing to work on those documents again.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagio's computer folks spent about an hour and a half doing
nothing but damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into our mail server and noticed 18 messages that were
going to go out with this attachment,'' said John Stewart, Imagio's
director of technical services. ``We believe it moved through the
network and even infected people who didn't open the e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Worm is written so that after it is activated in a mailbox
for the Microsoft Outlook program, it goes through a person's
e-mail inbox, sending out infectious, innocuous e-mails to any
address in the box.
</P>
<P>
   The Worm arrives by e-mail with a friendly message: ``Hi
(Recipient Name)! I received your e-mail and I shall send you a
reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Worm then begins searching a computer's hard drive for files
created with programs in Microsoft's top-selling Office suite _
Word, Excel and PowerPoint.
</P>
<P>
   Then it destroys them, leaving the file names intact, but
vaporizing the contents. It will also snake through the network
that a computer is attached to, destroying documents on other
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was first noticed in Israel on Sunday night, said Eric
Chien, a senior researcher at the Cupertino, Calif.-based Symantec
Anti-Virus Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was during their business day Monday,'' Chien said. ``The
virus hit about five of their major corporations. Early Monday
morning we hadn't heard much. But Monday night we got several
reports of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-virus team at Symantec, one of several industry groups
doing anti-viral work, had a solution down in an hour _ the fix is
to two delete two lines in a computer's WIN.INI file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a crucial junction in the virus world, now,'' Chien
said. ``Originally we saw'' viruses that a person needed to
physically move from computer to computer to infect others. ``Now,
we've got network-aware programs that get onto a computer and can
propagate themselves across the world in a matter of seconds by
e-mailing themselves, with no input from the user.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as systems administrators around the area realized what
was happening on their systems, they moved to shut mail access
down. Boeing upped system security. Computer users at Seattle's
Safeco Insurance Co. received a message from the company's help
desk telling them to be wary of e-mails with attachments. Microsoft
employees received a similar message from their company's main help
desk, telling them not to open e-mails with attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it had an attachment with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press contributed to this report.
</P>
<P>
   Killing the Worm
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted as an e-mail attachment and activated
when the attachment is opened up. Don't open unfamiliar e-mail. If
you're hit by the virus, Worm.ExploreZip will go after files with
the extensions: .doc, .xls, .ppt, .h, .c, .cpp and .asm.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to remove it if you're running Windows 95 or Windows
98:
</P>
<P>
   Restart your computer in MS-DOS and enter the WIN.INI file.
Remove the line
``run &QC; C:(backslash)WINDOWS(backslash)SYSTEM(backslash)Explore.exe
</P>
<P>
   Then delete the file
C:(backslash)WINDOWS(backslash)SYSTEM(backslash)EXPLORE.EXE

KINGS' LIST GETS SHORTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ John Van Boxmeer has made it onto the Los
Angeles Kings' short list.
</P>
<P>
   So has former Canadian national team coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' search for coach Larry Robinson's replacement
narrowed Thursday as general manager Dave Taylor announced through
a spokesman that former Buffalo Sabres coach Ted Nolan and Detroit
Red Wings assistant Dave Lewis have been eliminated from contention
for the position.
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer, coach and general manager of the IHL's Long Beach
Ice Dogs, had a second interview for the job Wednesday with Taylor,
assistant general manager Kevin Gilmore and team president Tim
Leiweke. Murray had a second interview Thursday. A fifth candidate,
Montreal Canadiens assistant coach Dave King, has yet to be invited
back for a second interview but has not officially been eliminated
from contention, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come back for a second interview and be considered as a
serious candidate is an excellent sign,'' Van Boxmeer said
Thursday. ``I'm flattered to be getting the consideration I'm
getting. I'm excited to be able to go back for a second interview.
Now, it's kind of wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer admitted the lengthy hiring process has him on edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of nerve-wracking when it's getting this close,'' he
said. ``You're excited that you're close. You're certainly very
excited about the possibility. There are a lot of things about the
Kings' situation I like. They're going into a brand-new building
and a brand-new practice site, and they're a team that has the
ability to rise very quickly through the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're better than they were last year (when they
missed the playoffs for the fifth time in six years). I think they
can rise rapidly. And they have a general manager who I have a lot
of respect for and feel very comfortable being around. It would be
a wonderful opportunity for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ice Dogs owner Barry Kemp said he has compiled a list of
candidates to replace Van Boxmeer, and said he expects he'll have
to use it, though he has yet to contact anyone on the list. Kemp
said if Van Boxmeer is hired by the Kings, he will offer the job to
former Kings defenseman Mark Hardy, the Ice Dogs' assistant coach.
But there's a possibility Hardy would follow Van Boxmeer to the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leiweke) has asked me about (Van Boxmeer),'' Kemp said. ``I
said the same thing I'd say to anybody: I can't imagine a better
candidate to take over the Kings. Here's a guy who's played at the
highest level, he was an All-Star as a player, he won a Stanley
Cup, he's been an assistant coach at the NHL level (with Buffalo),
he won a (championship) as a head coach in the AHL (at Rochester)
and he's kept us as one of the top two or three teams in the IHL
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's paid his dues. I can't imagine there's a candidate with
the variety of skills Boxy has who also has as much of an
understanding of the way an organization works. Granted, I'm a
little prejudiced, but put it this way: If I owned the Kings, I'd
hire him.''

MAN ACCUSED IN NAZI CASE LEAVES COUNTRY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 74-year-old Sullivan County, N.Y., man accused of
concealing his wartime past as a guard at three Nazi death camps in
Poland renounced his American citizenship and is now living in
Germany, federal officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dmytro Sawchuk of Glen Spey, appeared at the U.S.
Consulate in Frankfurt on March 23 to relinquish his American
citizenship, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan,
which had been seeking to deport him.
</P>
<P>
   Sawchuk had been accused by the Justice Department last year of
having lied to the Immigration and Naturalization Service about his
past. Rather than face a trial that was set to begin on Sept. 30,
officials said, he fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed last June in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, prosecutors said that Sawchuk, an ethnic Ukrainian who
was born in Leski, Poland, joined the German military in 1943 and
served at three slave labor and extermination camps in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The first was an S.S. labor camp in Trawniki, where prosecutors
said Sawchuk was an armed guard. Later, the government said, he was
a guard at the Belzec death camp, where the complaint claimed
Sawchuk guarded Jewish prisoners who were forced to exhume and burn
the corpses of hundreds of thousands of Jews who were murdered in
1942.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Sawchuk immigrated to the United States in 1951
from Germany and, by lying about his past, became a naturalized
citizen in 1957 in Manhattan, said Eli M. Rosenbaum, the director
of the Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations, which
seeks out and prosecutes Nazi war criminals living illegally in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum called Sawchuk's flight from American soil ``an
outstanding resolution of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to achieve cancellation of their ill-gotten U.S.
citizenship,'' he said. ``That's exactly what we accomplished in
this case. And it took far less time than if this case had gone
through the litigation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawchuk's lawyer, Ivars Berzins, declined through his secretary
to discuss his case or his client's move to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Weitzman, who directs a task force at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center that searches for Nazi-era war criminals, said that
Sawchuk's voluntary departure, while achieving the same goal as a
court trial would have, was less satisfying. ``On the one hand
you'd like to have a completed trial to show for the historical
record,'' he said Thursday. ``On the other hand, it's an admission
of clear guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Weitzman added that the Wiesenthal Center plans to formally ask
the German government to begin legal proceedings of its own against
Sawchuk. But that is not a likely prospect, said Rosenbaum in a
telephone interview from Washington. ``He would know that there are
many other people who have not been prosecuted, which is the case
generally in Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors were not exactly surprised upon hearing in March
that Sawchuk, who lived a reclusive life in Glen Spey, N.Y., with
his wife, had fled and given up any chance of legally returning to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an increasingly common result in our cases because our
track record in court indicates to them the likely futility of
going to trial,'' Rosenbaum said. ``Defendants discover that their
wartime misdeeds are going to be documented in court to the
world.''

HIGH SCHOOL GRAD AN INSPIRATION TO TULALIP TRIBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REBEKAH DENN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Most valedictorians can point to a handful of proud
relatives. Nicole Sieminski has around 3,400.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicole graduated from Marysville-Pilchuck High School in
Snohomish County on Thursday night, she drew accolades not only for
what she's done but for who she is: the first valedictorian from
the Tulalip Tribes.
</P>
<P>
   For Tulalip leaders, who have made a top priority of improving
poor graduation rates, Nicole's achievement was a cause for
celebration and an event they hope will inspire younger students
throughout the reservation near Marysville.
</P>
<P>
   The news was ``being bragged all around the tribes,'' said
Tribal Council Chairman Herman Williams Jr., with requests for
extra graduation tickets flooding the tribal office earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole was awarded a Pendleton blanket, a prized recognition for
tribal members of any age, particularly for one so young.
</P>
<P>
   Williams _ a former Marysville High student who regrets getting
an equivalency diploma rather than graduating _ said the gift of a
blanket will be a tradition for the future valedictorians he knows
the Tulalips will produce.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a day for celebration even without Nicole's
success.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two other Tulalip students are graduating, including 13
from the Tulalip Learning Center Alternative High School. This
represents roughly double the learning center's rate in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulalips have distributed a color poster with the names,
pictures and family heritage of each graduate, and they have bought
30-second TV commercials in Seattle and Bellingham with tribal
elder Raymond Moses reading the graduates' names.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a special day, a special night for all
Tulalip tribal members,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole, who graduated with a perfect 4.0 grade-point average,
had her pick of Ivy League schools, turning down Harvard and MIT in
favor of pre-med studies at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Verna James, the high school's liaison for Native American
students and mother of another 1999 graduate, called Nicole's
achievements inspirational.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to set our (goals) high and encourage kids to reach
them _ because it is possible,'' James said. ``We need to do
everything we can as adult people to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   A delighted James took Nicole to meet with tribal elders after
the school announced the names of the 560-student senior class's
co-valedictorians (senior Sabrina Habib shared the honor with
Nicole).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had her grandpa come with her, and her mom and dad and
aunts, to explain her family, and what branches she comes from, and
let them know the honor she was carrying,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicole, a math and science whiz who's taken college courses
the past few summers, the Tulalips' reaction has been a surprising
honor. A model student from elementary school onward, she's also
juggled participation in three sports and four school bands in
which she plays alto saxophone and vibraphone.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole set the goal of valedictorian in her freshman year and
said she did it for herself rather than to set an example for
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's so hard, but I haven't found it that hard
... if you just do your work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole said she's wanted to be a doctor as long as she can
remember, and she plans to return to the reservation after becoming
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need good doctors out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of commitment, the hope that tribal members will use
their education to benefit their people, is one of the reasons for
the financial and institutional support that the Tulalips provide
for students of all ages, partly fueled by the economic success of
their casino.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Tulalips pay tuition, books and a small living
stipend for the roughly 100 students a year who pursue higher
education, said John McCoy, the tribe's governmental affairs
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulalips also pay for tutoring, night school, summer school
and other intervention programs as early as kindergarten, leaders
said.
</P>
<P>
   They've printed the ``Native American Graduating Class'' poster
for about 10 years _ it includes Marysville graduates from other
tribes as well as their own _ and hold an annual banquet honoring
the Tulalip graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Less visible but perhaps more significant, each school that
Tulalip children attend has a liaison to help Native American
students, from mentoring to addressing cultural clashes to alerting
parents of attendance problems.
</P>
<P>
   The graduation rate for tribal members has doubled from 25
percent to about 50 percent in five years, according to James.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the improvement to the tribal support and to such
alternative programs as the Tulalip Learning Center, the
alternative high school that serves the area.
</P>
<P>
   School and tribal leaders said the alternative high school
provides flexibility and extra support for students who once would
have dropped out, overwhelmed by the size and strange faces of
Marysville's secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could work at your own pace (at the Tulalip Learning
Center),'' said Tashina Simpson, who graduated from the school last
night. ``The teachers are very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Tashina, who plans to attend Everett Community College, sought
out the alternative school after finding Marysville Junior High
crowded and alienating when she began eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   She was determined to graduate from high school even after she
had a baby 18 months ago, returning to class a week after her son
was born. Tashina said she hoped her diploma would prove something
to those who told her she would never be a success, that it would
show outsiders that ``native people can make it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor in her achievement, she said, was school liaison
Shonta Retasket-Truong, who helped with child care while she did
schoolwork, and often drove to Everett when Tashina moved there
three months ago and offered her rides to school. It made
attendance far easier than it had been when she took her son with
her on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Retasket-Truong, herself a graduate of the Learning Center, said
she's proud of all the students, but especially the handful of
young mothers who stuck with their schoolwork while meeting the
demands of caring for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Each student, Retasket-Truong said, overcame personal struggles
to become the newly minted graduates they are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all did a good job,'' she said.

NONSTANDARD WORK SCHEDULES TAKING TOLL ON MARRIAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dan Fox begged off the swing shift at Rocketdyne
when his kids got in school so he could be around to help with
homework, soccer and Little League.
</P>
<P>
   When the Quartz Hill resident returned to the 1 p.m. to midnight
shift this year, his wife, Lynne, was a little more receptive than
when the kids were young.
</P>
<P>
   ``All else being equal, she'd probably prefer I'd still be
working days,'' said Fox, 52.
</P>
<P>
   More Americans than ever are working nights and weekends, and
the resulting conflicts are straining many relationships to the
breaking point, according to a study published in Science magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of separation or divorce are six times higher for
fathers who work at night, compared to those who work during the
day. The odds are three times higher than normal when the mothers
work nights, said the study by University of Maryland sociologist
Harriet B. Presser.
</P>
<P>
   The study found fewer than 30 percent of Americans work a
``standard'' schedule _ 35-40 hours a week, daytime hours, Monday
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal more diversity in the labor force than
people realize,'' said Presser, who derived her findings from a
1997 Labor Department study of 48,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
   She found only 42 percent of working couples with children have
fixed weekday, daytime schedules. Parents who work opposing shifts
often see it as a benefit, so they can split child care during the
course of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Such an arrangement might seem convenient but can be
``enormously difficult and stressful to balance,'' said Susan D.
Einbinder, assistant professor of social work at the University of
Southern California. ``Having a relationship in general is
difficult. And when you throw in a child, that multiplies the
stress exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Working night shifts can mess with the body's rhythms and cause
sleep and health disturbances and threaten family relationships,
Presser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people living their lives that way. It's an
unresearched area, and it's an area policy-makers have not
addressed,'' Presser said.
</P>
<P>
   Einbinder added: ``We do very, very little for parents.
Government views kids as the property of the parents who had them,
but we all benefit if today's kids grow up into healthy,
well-adjusted adults. How well kids grow up is a joint venture
between parents and society.''
</P>
<P>
   Single mothers also are more likely than married ones to work
long hours and nonstandard schedules, Presser said. Yet
policy-makers have been slow to recognize the shift in work
patterns and the need for off-hour child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, it would be heaven if they had really good day
care at night,'' said Sarah Straw, 21, of Canoga Park, a single
mother of a 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   She works at the Saddle Peak Lodge restaurant in Calabasas as a
hostess until at least 10 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard. You have to find a sitter,'' she said.
``It's hard to find someone you trust who can come into your
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Presser said the shift toward night and weekend work comes from
a push toward a 24-hour global economy, dual-income couples
demanding after-hours entertainment and other services, and a boom
in service jobs. Those jobs _ in restaurants, malls, video stores,
etc. _ often involve nonstandard work hours.
</P>
<P>
   For Fox, now a swing shift manager at Rocketdyne Propulsion &AMP;
Power, working days meant a lot 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was about the time my children were hitting Little League
age,'' he said. ``I felt real strongly about being involved with my
kids and schools and sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But he realizes not everyone is lucky enough to adjust their
schedules to family needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so large, we have the flexibility to do a little
rotation'' of schedules, he said. ``But I'm sure a lot of small
businesses don't have that luxury. I've been real blessed, where
it's worked out real well.''

STARS ROAR BACK TO EVEN SERIES ON HULL'S GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Statistically speaking, you could spin this one almost
any way you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no statistic that could measure what the Stars put
on the ice last night in the third period: desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled hard, and we deserved to win,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said proudly after the Stars scored three third-period
goals to take a 4-2 victory against the Buffalo Sabres in Game 2 of
the Stanley Cup Finals. ``We were a little desperate out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull scored his first game-winning goal of the playoffs
with 2:50 remaining to allow the Stars to tie the best-of-seven
series at one game apiece. The Hull goal broke a series of
statistical trends, including the one that had the Stars 1-5 in
games in which Hull had scored playoff goals. The game also saw the
Sabres drop to 10-2 in playoff games in which they score first. But
maybe the most important statistic is the one that says teams that
win Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals have gone on to win 27 of the
past 31 series.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds a lot better to Stars fans than the statistic that
said teams that win Game 1 take the series 80 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now, it's time to throw the statistics out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a helluva series,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I
see every game coming down to the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   While Hull's goal, an empty-netter by Derian Hatcher and Craig
Ludwig's seeing-eye shot that was his first playoff goal since 1988
were ecstatic moments for the roaring crowd of 17,001 at Reunion
Arena, the Stars didn't escape without some scars. Stars center and
leading scorer Mike Modano hurt his left wrist on a third-period
hit by Jay McKee of the Sabres. Modano did not return to the game
and is ``probable'' for Game 3 tomorrow in Buffalo, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   If Modano can't go, expect Hitchcock to move Tony Hrkac to the
first line. Hrkac was exceptional in his first game back in the
lineup after missing more than a month with cracked ribs. He took
Modano's place after the injury and assisted Hull on the
game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Chambers won a puck battle to rim the puck around, and
Hrkac found Hull at the top of the right circle as the arena was
getting more and more intense in expectations of a second overtime
game. Hull unleashed his vicious one-timer _ the hardest shot the
Stars have on their team _ and the puck whistled past Hasek's
blocker, off the right post and into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that from Hullie,'' Nieuwendyk said of the man who
was signed as the Stars' hired gun in the off-season. ``We need him
in situations like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's shot was the culmination of a wild third period in which
the Stars bowed their necks and made a series of the Finals. After
running into a spider web of team defense and coming up with just
12 shots in the first two periods, the Stars unloaded 19 shots in
the third period and swarmed the Sabres' All-World goalie Dominik
Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig gave the Stars their first lead of the game at the 4:25
mark as he whistled a puck through a crowd after Brian Skrudland
won a faceoff to the right of the goal. It broke a 102-game playoff
goal drought for Ludwig dating back to March 9, 1988 _ the longest
in Stanley Cup playoffs history. It was also just the fourth goal
of his 172-game playoff career.
</P>
<P>
   However, the lead was short-lived as Buffalo stormed back to tie
the game on an Alexei Zhitnik power-play goal just 1:09 later.
</P>
<P>
   But that's when the Stars showed their desire. They outbattled
the Sabres for just about every loose puck and forced officials to
hand over a few power-play chances. Spurred by great opportunities,
particularly three big shots by Hull on a 5-on-3, the Stars finally
took momentum from their power play instead of losing it.
</P>
<P>
   That led to more aggression and more puck hunting, and it paid
off in Hull's game-winner. The Stars then had to kill a final
penalty to Hatcher at the 17:31 mark and capped off the victory
with a Hatcher empty-net goal.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the Stars threw out a stunning 48 hits to the
Sabres' 38. But then again, we weren't going to talk statistics.
What the Stars did was go after Hasek and maul him for much of the
game. They never gave up against a fierce Sabres defense, and they
sent a message that they're not out of this quite yet. In short,
they reclaimed their desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we learned to hate Buffalo,'' Ludwig said. ``Because
we obviously didn't take them as seriously as we should have.''

CHAMIQUE MYSTIQUE OVERCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Yes, the New York Yankees were at the White House
Thursday to be honored by President Clinton. But this town had much
more on its mind; namely the arrival of No. 1 draft pick Chamique
Holdsclaw to the Mystics as the team made its season debut against
the Charlotte Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras followed her out of the locker room and microphones
caught her every word, but ultimately she, the fans, and the media
knew that the only thing that mattered was how she delivered on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her 18 points, including two 3-pointers, everyone
came to realize that one player does not make a team. The Sting
handed the Mystics an 83-73 loss at the MCI Center. And aside from
the the star quality that Holdsclaw brought, the sellout crowd of
20,674 left the arena feeling like they did most of last year, when
the team had the worst record in the league (3-27).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I played a good game, but we didn't do enough as a
team to win tonight,'' Holdsclaw said.
</P>
<P>
   And the player who led her high school team to four
championships and Tennessee to three NCAA titles, acknowledged that
the feeling of defeat is not one she's familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the last time she lost the first game of the season,
Holdsclaw just laughed and said, ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   When Holdsclaw scored the team's first field goal with a jumper
just over 2 minutes into the game, the crowd went crazy _ this is
what they had come to see. But it was another Tennessee grad, Nikki
McCray, who would light up the first half for the Mystics, as the
5-foot-11-inch guard drove for the next two baskets.
</P>
<P>
   She finished the half with 13 points and four rebounds, as the
Mystics took a 36-34 lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But that would be their biggest lead of the game, as the Sting
kept up the pressure and pulled away to a 14-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team had spurts, and Chamique had spurts as well,'' said
Mystics coach Nancy Darsch. ``But Charlotte is the best team in the
East, I'm convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sting's zone defense befuddled the Mystics, and led
Washington to commit 15 turnovers. Not to mention the play of
new-kid-in-the league Dawn Staley, who scored a game-high 23
points, including three 3-pointers. Staley, a 5-6 guard who was on
the '96 Olympic gold-medal team, had played in the ABL for the past
two years, and was drafted by the Sting when the league folded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawn Staley is not one of the best point guards in the world
for no reason,'' Darsch said. ``She really ran that team and made
the plays in the second half when we were trying to make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the offense was Sting guard Stephanie McCarty, from
NCAA champion Purdue, who scored all of her 11 points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   After tying the score, 63-63, with less than 10 minutes to go,
the Sting went on an 18-4 run, and the Mystics could never recover.
</P>
<P>
   McCray led the Mystics with 22 points, followed by forward
Muriel Page (14), and forward Shalonda Enis (11).
</P>
<P>
   And even though Holdsclaw's team didn't win, she gave the fans a
taste of what they had seen during her four years at Tennessee _
her pull-up jumpers, her 3-pointers, and her drives to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, she said she was just as disappointed as the
fans were. ``I guess I'm a sore loser,'' Holdsclaw said. ``I like
to win.''

CONTROVERSIAL SPEAKER TESTS THE PRINCIPLES OF SCHOOL PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ During a two-decade career in higher education,
Jane Jervis learned well the principles of academic freedom,
including the freedoms of speech, thought and expression.
</P>
<P>
   But never have those principles been tested as fiercely as they
have over the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jervis, president of The Evergreen State College, is at the
center of a controversy over the school's decision to hear remarks
at Friday's graduation ceremonies from a convicted cop killer.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of the slain officer, police from across the nation,
even the attorney general of Pennsylvania have urged Jervis to
rescind the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Jervis says she will allow the taped remarks of Mumia Abu
Jamal, who is awaiting execution in Pennsylvania, to be heard by
about 800 graduates, their family and friends during commencement
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal, convicted of killing Philadelphia police Officer Daniel
Faulkner in 1981, was chosen by students to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose to include Mumia, not because he's the killer of a
police officer, ... but because he has created an international
conversation about the whole issue of poverty, the
(disproportionate) numbers of blacks in prison and the death
penalty,'' she said. ``The educational principle here is for
students to be confronted by the dissidence of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a graduation ceremony that highlights the real
issues in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   While Evergreen has never shied from controversy, the selection
of Abu Jamal as a commencement speaker has brought controversy to a
new level. Faulkner's widow, Maureen, will attend the ceremony,
with police officers and other supporters from across the state
joining her protest.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner's supporters are asking students who object to Jamal to
stage a silent protest, such as standing and turning their backs
when Jamal's remarks are played, or wearing blue ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., GOP Rep. Tom DeLay from Texas, the House
majority whip, will ask the House to observe a moment of silence to
protest Evergreen's decision to hear from Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a symbol of cowardliness, lies, deceit and outright
murder,'' said Suzie Sawyer, executive director of Concerns of
Police Survivors, which represents families of slain officers. ``He
has never shown one bit of remorse. He absolutely has no respect
for any system of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamal, a Black Panther turned writer, journalist and activist,
claims he was framed by police and railroaded by a racist criminal
justice system. He has become a cause celebre among death penalty
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction _ by a mixed jury _ has been upheld by appeals
courts. His case in now before the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal's selection by Evergreen students has been controversial
from the beginning. Washington state troopers reacted angrily, and
their pressure led Gov. Gary Locke in April to withdraw as the
commencement's keynote speaker.
</P>
<P>
   On the Evergreen campus, his selection has sparked debate. On a
Web site set up by the college to air the issue, more than 150
students made their opinions known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry an officer lost his life,'' wrote one, ``but his
death has nothing to do with, nor is an intellectually defensible
argument against, their presentation of anyone's views about the
inherent and provable racism of our criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Another wrote, ``You ... insult not only the murder victim's
family and friends, but also the many honest and humane law
enforcement officers in this country who undertake impossible,
no-win task of protecting us.''
</P>
<P>
   Students involved in the efforts and decision to hear from Jamal
defended their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Yuri Koslen, 23, a member of the graduation committee that
selected Jamal, pointed to Evergreen's governing document, which
states: ``An essential condition for learning is the freedom and
right on the part of an individual or group to express minority,
unpopular or controversial points of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Jervis, a Radcliffe- and Yale-trained scholar, said Thursday she
has tried to meet that standard in defending the choice of Jamal.
At Evergreen, where she been president since 1992, every spring
seems to bring a contentious issue and new controversy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jervis said she's had doubts at times, but said principle
dictated her position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this is the right and decent thing to do,'' she said.
``I believe this is the right thing to do, and that belief is
important to me.''

STARS' MONEY TALKS AS HULL SHOWS WHY HE WAS SIGNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He lurks. He scores.
</P>
<P>
   It is what Brett Hull does and, no matter what the head coach
says, what he was brought here to do.
</P>
<P>
   And so, money talked last night. It talked so loud, there are
17,001 cases of earache to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   In time, it might be easier to put a price tag on the
game-deciding goal that Hull scored last night. For now, it looms
as every bit worthy of the $17.5 million that owner Tom Hicks spent
to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Stars lost this Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals, a Lake
Erie-sized hole would have awaited them in Buffalo. With the
Sabres' mitts firmly clutched around the Stars' necks, thanks to
the power play, the possibility of another stunning home loss
clearly existed.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull lurked _ as he has quietly done for all of his career _
and, with less than three minutes to play, Hull scored.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fable that yet exists, propagated this week by the
invading Northern media, that the reason the Stars fizzled in the
Western Conference finals last season was the mental unraveling of
goaltender Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the scoring, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the power play and the paucity of scoring depth
once center Joe Nieuwendyk was injured were far better reasons for
the Stars' demise. Oh, the Detroit Red Wings also had much to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the wake of that defeat, the Stars needed a goal scorer _
not a straitjacket or a shrink for Belfour. Hicks, who has a thing
for fireworks, signed Hull on the day before the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   At last, a distinct difference in this final series. The Sabres
and Stars have been touted as cousins, reared from the same
defense-first trough.
</P>
<P>
   But let's talk money. While Buffalo was slashing payroll and
making the talented Michael Peca dance naked for his new contract,
the Stars were shamelessly adding a guy who had scored 554 career
goals.
</P>
<P>
   And they will every time. The difference is as broad as, well,
Dallas and Buffalo. Ferraris (leased, of course) and factories.
Chrome skyscrapers and chicken wings.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was able to issue the ``sign'' order for Hull in a deal
that could eventually cost $24 million over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Last night he got to watch the Cadillac drive off the lot.
</P>
<P>
   Goals like this are why the Stars signed Hull. Nobody in the
Stars' locker room, despite that defensive mantra they chant, can
argue that point now.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the Stars' Nieuwendyk said of the game-winner, ``We
expect that from Hullie. He's a great shooter, a goal scorer. We
certainly need him in situations like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the playoffs started, you could replant a small forest
with the newsprint that has been wasted chronicling the ``new''
Brett Hull. The allegedly forechecking Hull. The
maintain-my-proper-positioning Hull. The ``team guy'' Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, puh-leese. A scorer has to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   He does not weave gentle figure eights through the ice, as a
Mike Modano will do. He doesn't jet from goal line to blue line the
way he once did.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he has always been the cocked pistol at the poker table.
Just floating. Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   When Tony Hrkac got him the puck high in the slot late in the
third period last night, Hull knew what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you give Brett a good luck from that range, he's going
to take advantage,'' teammate Craig Ludwig said. ``He's something
special to watch in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On the game-winning goal, joining Hull on the ice were Ludwig,
Hrkac, Shawn Chambers and Jere Lehtinen. With Modano injured and
back in the dressing room, the Stars still were able to juggle to
find the right scoring combination.
</P>
<P>
   In time, it will be depth that decides this best-of-seven
series. The deep-pocketed Stars should have the edge in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither team is going to go away easily,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue that _ not after the two tense nights at
Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the Cadillacs that lead the Stanley Cup parade, we were
reminded last night.
</P>
<P>
   They are expensive. But _ just ask the owner _ worth every
penny.  &LR; tagtop:Gil LeBreton, (817) 390-7760

SALES CAN'T PRODUCE MIRACLE VS. COMETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ No, it wasn't the storybook reunion of anyone's
imagination, and it wasn't the fairytale ending of anyone's dreams.
But the WNBA season is just beginning, so who knows what lies
around the next well-manicured corner? This is, after all, the city
of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it would have taken a miracle for the Orlando Miracle to
win Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, going up against the two-time WNBA champion
Houston Comets. There was none, unless you count Orlando pulling
within 4 points, 49-45, early in the second half, as Houston
triumphed, 77-63, in front of 15,422 nonetheless rocking fans in
Orlando Arena, thrilled to finally have women's professional
basketball in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   And no, none of the University of Connecticut alumni making
their WNBA debuts were the stars of the game, although from the way
things shaped up Thursday night, Nykesha Sales is going to get
plenty of opportunity to be just that for the fledgling Miracle,
while New England Blizzard expatriates Kara Wolters and Jennifer
Rizzotti are likely to be relegated to supporting roles as rookie
draftees on the talent-ridden Comets. Neither saw action Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a role I've ever been in before,''
acknowledged an upbeat Rizzotti after the game. ``I'll do what I
can to help the team, and if that means playing hard in practice to
help the starting team, that's what I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales, meanwhile, started at shooting guard for the Miracle and
played 33 minutes, scoring 13 points and grabbing six rebounds.
Although acknowledging first-half jitters (``There was a lot of
hype about this game,'' she said. ``I'm pretty glad it's done'')
that induced her to go a dismal 3 for 15 from the floor as she
tried to do too much, she settled down in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carolyn Peck, making her own WNBA debut after leading
Purdue to the NCAA title last season, isn't worried. ``There are
nights when your shot just doesn't fall,'' she said of Sales's
performance. ``I'm not going to handcuff her. She's always got the
green light.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales, the 6-foot, 160-pound guard/forward who is UConn's
all-time leading scorer, was the first player assigned to the
Miracle, Sept. 15, 1998. Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, she grabbed the first
defensive rebound in franchise history, and scored the first points
of her professional career when she hit a soaring 3-pointer with
12:27 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Taj McWilliams, most recently of the ABL's Philadelphia Rage,
will go down in history as the first Miracle scorer, however,
thanks to her 3-pointer 2:04 into the game. Unfortunately for
Orlando, they were the only points amid a 9-3 run by Houston to
open the game, with Comets forward Tina Thompson showing why she
was an All-WNBA first-teamer last season when she scored 7 of those
9. She would end a searing first half with 17 points, shooting 7
for 11 from the floor, and trailed only Cynthia Cooper's game-high
24 points with 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets led by as much as 18 in the first half, before
Orlando went on a late 14-6 run to cut it to 43-35 at the half.
With two-time league MVP Cooper hobbling on an ankle sprained
Wednesday in practice, the Miracle might have been hoping for just
that. But what to say about the mythic Cooper, who played every
minute of the second half and took over the game every time Orlando
started nibbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have known Cooper was going to make plays,'' said
Houston coach Van Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sales, long known for her electric play at UConn, she
took the loss and her role in it as a learning experience. ``I need
to slow down a little bit, let the game come to me,'' she assessed
afterward. After all, ``I'm a rookie.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Maybe not by choice, but Jose Lima was a relatively little-known
starting pitcher last season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He nearly tripled his career wins total in one season, his walks
total was almost invisible, and the Astros were almost certain to
get seven or eight innings from him in each of his starts.
</P>
<P>
   Things were going so well, some observers began to whisper that
his performance was a fluke, that a pitcher with such an
undistinguished prior record could not continue to perform
consistently well.
</P>
<P>
   The talk became louder after Lima finished his first full season
as a major-league starter with 16 victories, seven more than in his
previous four years as a starter and reliever with the Astros and
Detroit combined. With only that one successful season under his
belt, Lima spoke of grander aspirations for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Lima knew back then is no longer a secret. Word is
spreading like wildfire around baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Once happy just to be included as one of the Astros' five
starters, Lima has been a leader in one of baseball's top
rotations. Lima boasts a 10-2 record _ the most wins in the NL _
and has an impressive 2.72 ERA. He has yielded just 1.4 bases on
balls per nine innings, ranking second behind Atlanta's Greg
Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   He is 26-10 since becoming a starter in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The success has spilled over _ the Astros have a .689 winning
percentage in games Lima pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Lima is pitching like an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody in the National League that
deserves to be an All-Star more than Jose Lima at this point,''
said Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker. ``He's been consistent
and gone late into games every time out. I don't think you could
ask any more from a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has certainly been one of the remarkable stories
pitching-wise the last year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of injuries to two starters last season, Lima moved
into the starting rotation _ and almost instantly showed he
belonged.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start last season, against the high-powered
Colorado Rockies, he allowed one run and four hits in seven
innings. By the middle of May he was 6-1, at which time he ran into
a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, knowing he couldn't rely on just two pitches, sought the
advice of pitching coach Vern Ruhle, who helped Lima incorporate a
sinker and a slider into his repertoire. After July 17, Lima was
8-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says we made the decision (to put him in the
starting rotation),'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``That decision
made itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had other guys get hurt, and he got the position by
default. He took it and ran with it. He's the one that deserves all
the credit. It wasn't any genius on our part that we could see he
was going to develop into one of the best starting pitchers in the
league. We never dreamed this could happen this fast.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Lima said he viewed every start like it was going to be
his last. Job security is better in his second year, as evidenced
by the $1.95 million, one-year contract he signed last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would be the fifth starter,'' said Lima, who will
start Saturday against the San Diego Padres. ``Now I can be
somebody's one, two or three (starter). I've got to credit my
teammates. They play hard behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to continuing to pitch the way I have
been. I feel like I can beat anybody in the league. That's how I
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He has become arguably the best pitcher on the Astros'
NL-leading staff, which has a 3.77 team ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, a former pitcher, believes confidence is what sets Lima
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care whether you're pitching or playing another sport,
if you believe in yourself as much as he does, you have a greater
chance to succeed,'' Dierker said. ``He's very confident and
extremely durable.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not?
</P>
<P>
   Lima won a career-high eight straight games between April 14 and
May 23 and notched his 10th victory of the season Monday over the
Chicago White Sox. He didn't win his 10th game last season until
Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   He matched the club record for reaching double figures in wins
in the fewest appearances, accomplishing it in 12 starts. In 1964,
Turk Farrell went 10-1 in his first 12 games for the Colt .45s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten wins in 12 starts I'll take it,'' Lima said. ``I think
this is going to be a special year for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, 26, has shown remarkable control on the mound. During a
start against Milwaukee on the recent road trip, Lima walked none,
struck out eight and allowed a career-low four hits in a 9-1
complete-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-one of his 98 pitches were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm in a zone,'' Lima said. ``I don't want to say
I'm the best pitcher in the league. I just want to let my numbers
do the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had to pick the team tomorrow, he would be on it,''
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be all he needs to earn his first All-Star berth.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego manager Bruce Bochy will select the pitching staff for
the July 13 All-Star Game in Boston. Bochy has a member of the
Padres' staff compiling statistics on potential All-Star
candidates. He has said his decisions will be made on numbers
alone.
</P>
<P>
   What would it mean if Lima headed to Boston with Craig Biggio
and Jeff Bagwell, two other Astros likely to make the team?
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great accomplishment,'' Lima said. ``I could
tell my son one day his dad played in the All-Star Game.''

HEAVY METAL: THE GREAT BAT SPAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was supposed to be a quick fix to save the game.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, aluminum bats are a fixture in college
baseball. That's a quarter-century of hearing PING when bat meets
ball. Hundreds of home runs that would have been flyouts. Thousands
of base hits instead of broken bats.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Adams remembers 1974, the season the NCAA switched from
wooden to metal bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, there was a recession going on,'' said Adams,
UCLA's head baseball coach who was then at UC Irvine. ``It hit the
colleges hard. The biggest part of your budget was the dozens and
dozens of (wooden) bats you had to order. As a temporary fix,
Easton came out with this aluminum bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking at the time, this is only
 &UR; !ital! &LR; temporary, we'll get back to baseball the way it was meant
to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   It never happened. Colleges stuck with aluminum while the
disparity between batting and pitching reached levels more
associated with Little League than the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all in favor of going back to the wooden bat,'' Adams
said. ``It would be well worth it to improve the integrity of our
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing offense is the NCAA's goal, believing it will make the
college game more credible. And to avoid incidents like the beaning
of Cal State Northridge pitcher Andrew Sanchez by a line drive at
USC on April 2. Sanchez suffered a fractured skull and spent four
days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the NCAA plans to announce the findings of a research
panel commissioned to study the effects of aluminum and wooden
bats. The issue isn't going away anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Skyrocketing offense and pitchers' safety were at the forefront
when the NCAA baseball rules committee took steps last summer to
put new restrictions on aluminum bats for the first time since 1988
(see chart).
</P>
<P>
   There are some trickle-down effects from the NCAA's decision to
make new rules about aluminum bats. The rules committee of the
National Federation of State High School Associations expects to
discuss the aluminum-bat issue at its meeting in July.
</P>
<P>
   The aluminum-bat debate exploded last year when the cumulative
batting average of NCAA Division I teams was .306, an all-time
high, and USC beat Arizona State 21-14 in the CWS championship
game. The scale tipped to the purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The games get too long,'' said Dennis Poppe, the NCAA director
of championships, who heard an earful from CBS after last year's
nine-inning final took 3 hours, 59 minutes to complete. ``It's good
for the game to have more balance between offense and defense. I'm
concerned about the large number of runs that are scored.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA wants to make aluminum bats perform more like wood, but
aluminum-bat contracts are big business for the nation's top
baseball programs. Van Nuys-based Easton Sports has a lawsuit
pending in federal court seeking $267 million in damages from the
NCAA if further restrictions make aluminum bats unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Adams calls himself a ``traditionalist.'' So does Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess, but Marquess also likes the way aluminum bats
have added excitement to the college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``College baseball is at its height, as far as interest and
attendance,'' said Marquess, the Cardinal's head coach since 1977.
``Do we shoot ourselves in the foot? I don't want to make our
(scores) 2-1. I don't think that's popular with our fans. Nobody
wants 25-20 (scores), but fans like 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there too much offense in this college game?'' he asked.
``That's a legitimate question. (But) the aluminum bat is going to
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   In what form? When the College World Series begins today, teams
are using bats that are smaller and heavier than last year. Hitters
have used them all season to prepare for the postseason, when they
are required, and offensive statistics have decreased across the
board.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative Division I batting average through April 11,
according to a report published by the NCAA, was .301, down from
last year's season average of .306. Scoring had decreased from 7.12
runs in '98 to 7.03.
</P>
<P>
   Hitters grudgingly accepted the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, (aluminum bats) make the game more fun,'' said
Danny Phillips, who led Cal State Northridge with 16 home runs this
season. Phillips signed with the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday
after being picked in the 15th round of the major-league draft.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN second baseman Kevin Patrick, who graduated this spring,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want every advantage you can have as a hitter,'' said
Patrick, who batted .349 in 55 games this season. &QL; 
++Pitchers' enemy
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers don't have any advantages against the aluminum bat.
They can make a good inside pitch and jam the hitter, only to see
the ball blooped over the infield for a base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aluminum bat allows the hitter to make a mistake on an
inside pitch and still get away with it,'' said Frank Marcos,
director of the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau. ``You're not
seeing pitchers aggressively challenge hitters. It's most obvious
at the college level. The margin of error is so much greater with
that wooden bat than with the aluminum.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine senior right-hander Brad Tucker, who was almost hit
in the head by a line drive in the West Coast Conference
championship game against Loyola Marymount two weeks ago, said he's
less bothered by the chance of getting hit by a line drive than
watching batters get hits off good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not the safety thing,'' Tucker said. ``It's when
you jam a guy and what would not have been a hit with a wood bat,
it turns into a hit with an aluminum bat. It can cost you a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA baseball rules committee has tried in the past to help
pitchers, but every new restriction was met with more offense.
</P>
<P>
   When aluminum bats debuted in 1974, there was one NCAA rule on
the books: The bat couldn't be longer than 42 inches. The impact of
metal was dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the year before metal bats, the cumulative Division I
batting average was .266. In 1974, it was .274. By 1977, Division I
baseball teams hit .289.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, the first generation of players who used aluminum
in Little League and high school arrived in college. Teams were
averaging more than 6{ runs per game, up from 4.96 in 1970. In
1984, the year Mark McGwire hit 32 home runs at USC, the cumulative
Division I batting average was .306.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA responded in 1988 with more stringent rules for metal
bats. The barrel diameter was limited to 2} inches. The
weight-to-length differential could not be more than five ounces.
For instance, a player couldn't use a bat the maximum length _ 36
inches _ and 30 ounces. A bat weighing 30 ounces had to be 35
inches.
</P>
<P>
   The dimensions of Omaha's Rosenblatt Stadium, where the College
World Series has been held since 1950, also became more conducive
to offense. The fences were moved in, home plate was moved up and,
predictably, more runs were scored.
</P>
<P>
   USC's football-like score (21-14) to win the national title last
year was a product of the monster the NCAA created.
</P>
<P>
   USC head coach Mike Gillespie, whose Trojans have been at the
center of the storm of controversy _ first with the national title
game and then when Sanchez was struck by a line drive by USC batter
Dominic Correa _ admits he's angered when a reporter asks him about
last year's championship score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that the proverbial straw?'' Gillespie asked. ``I think it
was. But people don't remember the day before we beat LSU 6-3. It's
much more complicated and complex than just the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the way the rules committee saw it last summer, when
it recommended major changes to aluminum bats. The day after the
committee made its intentions public, Easton filed its lawsuit. Jim
Easton, chairman of Easton Sports, declined to comment for this
story.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, the committee approved new postseason standards _
bats are smaller and heavier _ in Divisions I, II and III. There
was a problem. With the season beginning that week, virtually no
team had aluminum bats that conformed to the new standards. &QL; 
+++Going batty
</P>
<P>
   Between August of last year and mid-January, conferences, the
Pac-10 included, agreed to the new aluminum-bat standards providing
they were insured by manufacturers, primarily Easton and Louisville
Slugger, against liability from batted-ball injuries.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 15, Louisville Slugger, which has a bat contract with
the Pac-10, hadn't come to an agreement to assume liability.
Arizona State and Utah began the season that weekend by using
wooden bats, marking the first time wood had been used in a college
game since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   USC played two games with wood, against Cal State Dominguez
Hills and the first of a three-game series at Texas. Louisville
Slugger assumed liability that weekend with the Pac-10 and aluminum
bats returned.
</P>
<P>
   Safety has been the rallying cry of the NCAA in its attempts to
retard the performance of aluminum bats. However, almost every
college coach interviewed for this story downplayed the fear of
being hit with a line drive off an aluminum bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an element of risk in any sport,'' Marquess said. ``I
don't like the insinuation that college baseball coaches don't
really care about the safety of their players. If you talk to all
the college coaches, the majority of them will say it's not a
safety issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics support Marquess.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NCAA survey last year, 75 Division I schools
reported 182 pitchers being struck by batted balls, or once every
21 games. Kent Biggerstaff, head trainer of the Pittsburgh Pirates,
conducted his own study last year and found that of the 22
major-league teams that reported, pitchers were struck by a batted
ball at the rate of once every 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get out of the way of a ball that is hit hard if
it is hit with wood or aluminum,'' Adams said. ``(Cleveland Indians
pitcher) Herb Score was hit in the eye with a ball hit off a wooden
bat and it ruined his career.''
</P>
<P>
   One local college pitcher reflects the same concern the NCAA
shows. Jim DeBiase, a senior left-hander who just finished his
career at CSUN, said anyone who thinks pitchers have enough
reaction time to get out of the way of a line drive are fooling
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA appears to be following opinions like DeBiase's and
ignoring Biggerstaff's study, deciding to go ahead with more
stringent requirements for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about what they'll do in August,'' Louisiana State
head coach Skip Bertman told Baseball America magazine last month.
``The testing is not complete and it probably won't be complete. We
need to avoid the knee-jerk reaction we got last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he would like to return to wood. He thinks bat
companies would eventually keep costs down because of competition.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Milano, the former Cal coach, told Collegiate Baseball
magazine that some teams might need as many as 60 dozen bats for a
season. Collegiate Baseball put a price tag on a wooden bat: $22.
That means colleges could spend almost $16,000 per season on bats.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA could absorb the cost of switching to wood. Cal State
Northridge could not.
</P>
<P>
   Adams is also a realist. He says aluminum bats won't be leaving
the college game anytime soon, a fact which leaves him a little
sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say that our brand of baseball is comparable to Double-A or
even Single-A,'' Adams said, referring to two levels in the minor
leagues, ``but we use a bat that Little Leaguers use.'' &QL; 
BATTING ORDER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aluminum bats and the designated hitter are allowed for the
first time in college baseball. The cumulative Division I batting
average is .274, up from .266 the year before. &QL; 
__ 1984: Mark McGwire slugs a school-record 32 home runs and hits
.387 as a junior at USC. &QL; 
__ 1985: The NCAA Division I cumulative batting average is .306, an
all-time high. Teams average 6.94 runs per game and the cumulative
ERA rises to 5.51. Wichita State's Pete Incaviglia sets an NCAA
record with 48 homers, a mark that still stands. &QL; 
__ Spring 1998: The Valley's Toluca Baseball League switches to
wooden bats after an incident the previous year in which a
9-year-old pitcher was struck in the head by a line drive off an
aluminum bat. &QL; 
__ May 14, 1998: Little League Baseball issues a statement on
non-wood bats: ``There appears to be no indication that would cause
Little League Baseball to mandate a limit on the weight of bats.'' &QL; 
__ June 6, 1998: USC beats Arizona State 21-14 in the
highest-scoring final in College World Series history. The eight
teams in the week-long CWS combined for a .318 average and 62 home
runs, both records. There hasn't been a shutout in the CWS since
1996. &QL; 
__ Aug. 7, 1998: Van Nuys-based Easton Sports, the industry's
leading aluminum-bat manufacturer, files a lawsuit against the NCAA
seeking $267 million in damages. Easton claims the NCAA rules
committee's proposed changes to bats will make existing bats
obsolete. The suit is pending in U.S. District Court. &QL; 
__ November 1998: The West Coast Conference and New Jersey Athletic
Conference announce they will switch to wooden bats for the 1999
season. WCC commissioner Michael Gilleran cites the threat of a
lawsuit as the impetus behind the switch from aluminum. &QL; 
__ Dec. 15, 1998: The NCAA Division I Championships Competition
Cabinet agrees with Divisions I and II that the maximum allowable
bat diameter should be 2| inches. &QL; 
__ January 15: The NCAA Executive Committee approves new standards
for 1999 postseason play for Divisions I, II and III. The
``two-thirds compromise'' limits bat diameters to 2| inches and the
weight-length differential to three ounces. &QL; 
__ Jan. 22: Arizona uses aluminum bats in a 19-6 win over St.
Mary's, which uses wooden bats. The Wildcats sweep the three-game
series and outscore the Gaels 35-8. &QL; 
__ Feb. 4: USC, using wooden bats, loses at Texas 5-3. The
Longhorns also use wooden bats for the first time in 25 years. The
Trojans receive a waiver from Louisville Slugger after the game
allowing them to once again use aluminum. &QL; 
__ April 2: Andrew Sanchez, a right-handed pitcher at Cal State
Northridge, is struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of
USC's Dominic Correa. After laying on the field for an hour,
Sanchez is taken to L.A. County USC Medical Center with an assumed
``mild concussion.'' Three days later he is diagnosed with a skull
fracture. &QL; 
__ Late April: A statistical report issued by the NCAA shows
offense in college baseball is down. The aggregate batting average
for 274 Division I teams is .301 in games through April 11,
compared to .306 in '98. &QL; 
__ Early May: The National Baseball Congress World Series bans
aluminum bats for its 2000 tournament. Eleven of the 16 leagues
that qualify for the tournament use wooden bats. &QL; 
__ May 28: The NCAA playoffs begin with new standards for aluminum
bats. In August, an NCAA panel studying bat performance decides
what kinds of bats teams will use in the future. &QL; 
__ Mid-July: The National Federation of State High School
Associations is expected to discuss the issue of making changes to
its aluminum-bat rules at its annual meeting in Kansas City. &QL; 
COMPARISON ON EXIT SPEEDS  &QL; 
(ball leaving the bat)  &QL; 
__ METAL BAT: 113 mph &QL;

HULL GOAL TOPPLES SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When the Stars went out and signed Brett Hull as a free
agent last July, their fervent hope was that paying Hull would pay
off in the form of a Stanley Cup for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, Hull showed exactly why they gave him a
three-year, $17.5 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hull drilled a near-perfect shot past Buffalo goalie Dominik
Hasek, beating him with a one-timer from the right circle with 2:50
left to lift the Stars to a 4-2 victory over the Sabres in Game 2
of the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought (Hull) got stronger as the game went on,'' said
Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock. ``I thought our veteran players played
with a lot of passion tonight and never quit.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is tied at one game apiece and switches back to
Buffalo for Games 3 and 4, beginning Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Craig Ludwig had given the Stars a 2-1 lead at 4:25
of the third period when Brian Skrudland beat Buffalo's Wayne
Primeau in the left faceoff circle. The puck went back to Ludwig
and he fired a shot that was deflected through Hasek's pads. It was
the 38-year-old Ludwig's first playoff goal since he scored for
Montreal in a game against Hartford back in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one for the '90s,'' quipped Hitchcock. ``That's it.
He's done.''
</P>
<P>
   That lead only lasted 1:11, though, because the Sabres tied it
on their second power-play goal of the game. After Curtis Brown
fired a shot from the slot that goalie Ed Belfour saved, defenseman
Alexei Zhitnik blasted the rebound from the left circle past
Belfour's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were able to stave off a 43-second five-on-three
disadvantage, but they couldn't prevent the surging Stars from
taking the game.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Derian Hatcher added an empty-netter with 25.8
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   As close and as intense as Game 1 ended, that's just how Game 2
began.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek faced some pressure of a different kind in that period.
Hitchcock vowed his team would put more heat on the netminder but
not to the point of running him. However, at 12:25, Skrudland ran
over Hasek in the left corner and received a charging penalty.
Players on the Buffalo bench stood and pointed to the other end at
Belfour, letting him know his turn was coming.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the period, all kinds of contact broke out,
starting with Mike Modano clipping Hasek, and then Hasek was jawing
with Jamie Langenbrunner. That caused Dallas's Joe Nieuwendyk and
Buffalo's Brian Holzinger to drop the gloves. Buffalo defenseman
Richard Smehlik then wrestled with Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   At the 20-minute mark, six players were assessed penalties,
three from each side, with Holzinger and Nieuwendyk getting five
minutes each for fighting while Modano got a tripping penalty,
Hatcher and Smehlik got roughing penalties, and Zhitnik earned two
minutes for cross-checking.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres came out strong in the second, taking a 1-0 lead on
the power play at 7:27. Defenseman Jason Woolley, who was the hero
in Game 1 when he scored at 15:30 of overtime, was positioned at
the right point. Michael Peca, who was left alone, skated from
right to left around the net and when he got near the left post, he
lifted his stick in the air and called for the puck. Woolley saw
the Buffalo captain and made a perfect pass, and Peca chipped the
puck past Belfour. At that point, the Sabres were outshooting
Dallas, 7-0. But that would change in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars then turned on the jets and started putting all kinds
of heat on Buffalo. Nieuwendyk had a shot from in tight that Hasek
had to handle. Later, it was Sergei Zubov who sailed a shot from
the right point that Hasek saved. The goalie could do nothing about
the Dallas goal at 18:26. Defenseman Richard Matvichuk teed up a
slapper from the left point that Langenbrunner redirected high into
the net to tie the game, 1-1, setting up a wild third period in
which the Stars outshot the Sabres, 19-4, and in which Hull was the
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you give Brett a good look from that range, he's going
to take advantage,'' said Ludwig. ``He's something special to watch
in that situation.''

<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Podujevo, Yugoslavia) _ As the long army convoy
roared out of Kosovo Thursday, beginning a defeated Serbia's
painful retreat from its historical heartland, a military policeman
in his black beret snapped a salute to each passing vehicle, tears
streaming down his face. Small knots of Serbs gathered quietly on
Podujevo's streetcorners in the wearying sun as the long column
moved past. Soldiers rode in military trucks and civilian busses,
and in passenger cars of every kind. Trucks full of stretchers
moved past, then portable kitchens and armored personnel carriers.
The Serbs stood shocked, pale and still, as if their blood was
draining into the gutter. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-FUTURE (Cologne, Germany) _ As the Clinton administration
turns toward the task of reviving life in Kosovo and what will
essentially be an international protectorate, officials envision an
entity that in theory remains a sovereign part of Yugoslavia but in
reality will be self-governing, and in the long run, probably
independent. Now that the war is over, the problem of the political
and economic status of Kosovo, a pocket of territory about the size
of Connecticut but now in ruins, will move to the forefront. By
Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   LEBANON-PALESTINIANS (Sidon, Lebanon) _ No one yet knows exactly
who fired Kalashnikov rifles into a courtroom here two days ago in
a massacre that killed the chief judge and three other court
officials. But the attack has focused attention on a problem that
Lebanon has long done its best to ignore. A large and angry
population of Palestinian refugees now numbers more than 300,000,
most living in camps _ like Ain Hilwe, just outside Sidon _ that
are ruled by armed militias. It was to Ain Hilwe that the gunmen
are believed to have fled. But like all the camps, Ain Hilwe is a
place where the Lebanese police and soldiers do not dare to go. By
Douglas Jehl.

IX, the federal law aimed at prohibiting discrimination against
athletes on the basis of gender. And now, at 27, Hamm represents
for many the full realization of sports opportunity for women. At
15, she became the youngest player ever to join the national soccer
team, and in winning a world championship and an Olympic gold medal
in recent years, she has scored 109 career goals, more than any
other man or woman ever to play the game. She has, as well, reached

in the off-season a lot of people scratched their heads. He was

the outfield. Now he has quickly become a big distraction in the

<P>
   CASSETT-EXHIBIT (Washington) _ ``Women should be someone and not
something,'' the American artist Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) once
wrote, emphatically underlining her words. And she dedicated a long
career to fleshing out this conviction through art. Her efforts
come across with a quiet, though sometimes surprisingly passionate
force in ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman,'' a succinct survey of her
paintings and prints at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
The show, which has appeared in Chicago and Boston, is the first
comprehensive look at Cassatt's work in nearly 30 years. And it
marks yet another step in evaluating an artist who was herself a
someone _ indeed, several someones _ to be reckoned with. By
Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   PLANET-EARTH (New York) _ Over more than a century, scientists
and explorers from the American Museum of Natural History have
searched the world and returned with arresting examples of life in
all its diversity: dinosaurs from Montana to Mongolia, birds and
butterflies, artifacts of exotic cultures from here to the South
Sea. For the last four years, their quest has been to collect the
stuff of Earth itself and bring it back for a new exhibition
illustrating the planet's 4.5 billion-year history. Now the
collections have been studied, winnowed and arranged for display in
the museum's newest permanent exhibit, the Gottesman Hall of Planet
Earth, which opens Saturday. By John Noble Wilford.

<P>
   TANGO-MANIA (New York) _ The Argentine tango is not unlike
chess. It is serious; it takes discipline; it must be studied hard
to be done well. It is elegant and formal, passionate and intimate.
It is about power and vulnerability. It is both a dance and a
metaphor. And to its captives, it can become a magnificent
obsession. By Janny Scott.

SPORTS COLUMN: STANLEY CUP POISED FOR A NEW SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich)  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The essential goodness in hockey comes out on these soft summer
evenings during the Stanley Cup finals. The players dream of more
than money or personal glory or just plain winning. They dream of
taking the cup back home.
</P>
<P>
   New families, new friends will be sharing the Stanley Cup this
summer, with either the Buffalo Sabres or the Dallas Stars taking
home North America's greatest sports trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars tied the series at one game each Thursday night with a
4-2 victory over the Sabres in Dallas, delighting the NHL, which is
rooting for a long and tangled series rather than the yawning
sweeps of the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The league has a few problems, hemmed in by Knicks madness as
well as the continuing absence of Chicago, Los Angeles and New York
television markets, and stuck with bankrupt ownership in Pittsburgh
and callous ownership on Long Island. But in these post-Gretzky
days, the league still has the Stanley Cup, its great and
longstanding star.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer passion, consider the way the players love the Stanley
Cup. Like figures in some medieval morality play, they practically
shield their eyes from the cup until it is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Woolley of the Sabres came close in 1996, when he played
for Florida but was swept by Colorado. The players went through
hockey's gracious ritual of the handshake line, and then Woolley
forced himself to watch the Avalanche players hoisting the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to be on the other end,'' Woolley recalled
Thursday. ``I think I watched for half a second and then I couldn't
stand it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of players will not even touch the cup until
they win it. When Shawn Chambers helped win the cup with the Devils
in 1995, he took it home with him to Sterling Heights, Mich. He
wanted his childhood friend, Derian Hatcher of the Stars, to drink
from the cup, but Hatcher declined, not out of superstition but out
of respect. Now they are teammates on Dallas, dreaming of drinking
together from it.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing the cup to go home for the summer is one of the great
traditions of sport. Joe Juneau of the Sabres grew up in Quebec,
watching on the CBC as the Canadiens hoisted one of their four
straight cups at the end of the 1970s. Last June he played for
Washington and lost in four straight to the Red Wings, and now he
has another chance to take the cup to Pont-Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about how you got here,'' Juneau said Thursday.
``You think about your parents, you think about your grandparents,
how they laced up your skates for you, how they drove you to
practices. All kinds of people have made sacrifices, so you can get
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in hockey knows the story of the old Canadiens'
temporarily leaving the cup by the side of the road. Everybody
knows about Clark Gillies letting his dog eat from the cup. (``He's
a nice dog,'' Gillies explained.)
</P>
<P>
   Woolley, who scored the overtime goal in the first game, was
dreaming out loud yesterday about taking the Stanley Cup to
Camborne Avenue in North York, Ontario, ``where my parents have
lived since Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   He will set the cup on the curb, where he used to play street
hockey (``in running shoes'') with his pals down the block, Gino
and Paul Cavallini, both of whom would have long careers in the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best street-hockey team in history,'' Woolley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cup no longer travels unattended, because the Hockey Hall of
Fame in Toronto sends out bodyguards to carry the cup to the great
cities and obscure hamlets that produce Stanley Cup players, now
expanded from Canada into the United States, Sweden, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Oke, one of the chaperones, makes no predictions about who
will win this cup, but he looks at Jere Lehtinen of Dallas and
thinks, ``I've never been to Finland'' _ and neither has the cup.
He looks at Geoff Sanderson of Buffalo and he thinks of Pine Point,
Northwest Territories, a portion of his own country that he has
never visited.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of last summer was Kelvington, Saskatchewan, a
town of 900 residents where 30,000 people showed up to greet Joey
Kocur, bringing home his third Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had hundreds of friends and neighbors sitting around the
campfire, in tents and trailers in his back yard, a real
festival,'' Oke recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Stanley Cup is on public display, first in the
Dallas Museum of Art the past few days, now in the Walden Galleria
in Buffalo. Soon the cup will be taking off on this summer's
magical mystery tour, with copious amounts of beverages being
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great rules of hockey is: On the Stanley Cup, all
germs are healthy.

INJURY MOVES DEBATE CLOSE TO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Something's not right with Andrew Sanchez. He
can't maintain his concentration through a 30-minute TV show. When
he travels in a car _ he can't drive _ he gets headaches. Just
sitting through a three-hour baseball game saps his energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez is 23. On April 2 he was a college athlete, finishing
out his baseball career as a relief pitcher for Cal State
Northridge. What happened that afternoon at USC changed his life. A
batted ball struck Sanchez in the forehead. He lay on the field for
an hour before he was taken to L.A. County USC Medical Center by
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez would later find out the impact of the ball fractured
his skull.
</P>
<P>
   ``In baseball, that's probably the scariest thing I've ever
seen,'' said Kevin Patrick, who was playing second base for CSUN
and was close to Sanchez when he was struck. ``He dropped to the
ground. His head was already swollen and turning blue.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a split-second for the line drive off the metal bat of
USC's Dominic Correa to strike Sanchez. Correa, primarily a second
baseman for the Trojans, has been used by USC as a reliever this
season. He never met Sanchez before the incident and he hasn't seen
him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no control over it, but I still felt bad,'' Correa said
recently. ``It seemed that it happened in slow motion. I was pretty
shook up.''
</P>
<P>
   Correa said he's in favor of stricter aluminum-bat rules. But he
was quick to point out his line drive would have struck Sanchez
even if he was using a wooden bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have made a difference,'' he said. ``I think it
would have hit him the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Correa's statement would probably fall upon deaf ears in the
NCAA office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure we have a sport that doesn't put a
student-athlete at risk,'' said Dennis Poppe, the NCAA director of
championships. ``You're never going to make (college baseball)
completely safe. It's a part of the game. You just want to minimize
that risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said he's only seen one
pitcher seriously hurt by a batted ball in 28 years of coaching. He
said safety should not be an issue in the aluminum-bat debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who took a medical withdrawal from his classes in
April, is consulting with a lawyer over a possible lawsuit against
Louisville Slugger, which made the aluminum bat used by Correa. He
said he couldn't be interviewed for this story.

STREET STOCKS ENJOY BULL MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ The screeching of the tires is louder than
the engines. The driving is less than stellar.
</P>
<P>
   The older American-made cars look like they've been in too many
fender-benders; they do not have the perfect paint jobs and some
parts look mismatched. But in the low-budget world of Street
Stocks, it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   No 100 mph speeds. No obtaining a sponsorship from some
multimillion dollar corporation. Perhaps, a sponsor from the small
store down the street.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator for the drivers of these everyday
jalopies is to race, have fun, learn a little and do it as cheaply
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a race fan, but I never had the finances to
get started,'' said Covina resident Luis Del Real, who will race on
Irwindale Speedway's third-of-a-mile oval on Saturday night. ``I
would always go to Saugus before it closed, and then went to the
Orange Show in San Bernardino to watch races. I always wanted to be
involved; I just had to save my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Real, who says his favorite driver is Dale Earnhardt -- his
1972 Chevrolet Nova is painted black with the number 3 on the side
-- finally saved the funds necessary to begin racing this year. He
is in second place in the point standings, 12 points behind Michael
Pope. Del Real and Pope are the only drivers to have competed in
every Street Stock race at Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked long hours to get ready for this year,'' Del Real,
39, said. ``Seven days a week, every weekend and after getting off
work, I was in the garage getting it ready. My wife says it is my
second wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Romo had the same obsession as Del Real. The Covina
resident said running hot laps at the Orange Show convinced him to
try racing. He purchased a 1972 Monte Carlo and put it together in
his garage, just down the street from Del Real. Romo said it cost
about $3,500 to get his car race-ready and, in his first outing
three weeks ago at Irwindale, he finished third in a five-car
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I always wanted to do,'' Romo, 37, said.
``ln that (first) race, it was real exhilarating and very exciting.
It was awesome.''

BRAWLS AND BRUISES AS STARS EVEN STANLEY CUP FINALS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stanley Cup finals surged into high gear Thursday
night with a dramatic Dallas victory amid a series of serious
developments. The Stars beat Buffalo by 4-2, the winning goal a
slap shot by Brett Hull past Dominik Hasek with 2 minutes and 50
seconds remaining to break a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory evened the best-of-7-game series at one victory
apiece and guaranteed that the championship round would last more
than four games for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The evening featured a brief multiplayer fight that included two
major penalties, rare for post-season games in recent seasons. The
minibrawl broke out after several Dallas players spent the first
period colliding with Hasek. Although Hasek did not seem rattled by
the tactics, he gave up three goals, with the fourth going into an
empty net in the final minute after he was pulled for an extra
attacker during a Sabres power play.
</P>
<P>
   The player who fouled Hasek to trigger the brawl, Mike Modano,
was not in the game at the frantic finish, and his absence could be
the most significant event of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, a talented and high-scoring center, left the game in the
third period with what the Stars say was a wrist injury. He was
hurt after checked into the boards by Jay McKee, a Sabres
defenseman. Although the injury appeared to be higher up on his
body, possibly to his shoulder, Modano and his coach insisted that
it was a bruised and swollen left wrist and said Modano is probable
to play in Game 3 on Saturday night in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is traditional in the NHL for teams to be less than
candid during the playoffs when discussing injuries, particularly
to stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day,'' Modano said, when asked about the prognosis.
``It's pretty tender and sore.''
</P>
<P>
   No penalty was called on the play. Modano said he jammed his
elbow into the space between panes of glass above the boards.
Modano has 18 points in the playoffs, second on the team behind Joe
Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   Modano's replacement, Tony Hrkac, set up the goal with a pass to
Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the goals everyone wants to get,'' said Hull, who
has two in this series and seven in the post-season. ``I just bury
the head and shoot it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars clinched it in the final minute when Derian Hatcher
came out of the penalty box to shoot the puck into the empty net.
It ended a rugged game of tight checking and tension, filled with
ties and lead changes.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock, the Dallas coach, said: ``For a low-scoring game,
it sure was exciting. Good win. We're back in the series. It's
going to be a hell of a series.''
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, the Stars were 23 points better than
Buffalo, but the teams have appeared evenly matched. Dallas was the
first-seeded team in the West; Buffalo the seventh-seeded team in
the East. Michael Peca, the captain of the Sabres, said: ``We are
obviously disappointed with the outcome, but we are confident going
back to Buffalo with the split.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took a 2-1 lead at 4:25 of the third period on a goal by
Craig Ludwig, a shot-blocking defenseman who rarely scores. After
Brian Skrudland of the Stars won a faceoff from Wayne Primeau, he
sent the puck back to Ludwig, who wristed a screened shot from high
in the left-wing circle that beat Hasek between the skates.
</P>
<P>
   But Buffalo soon tied it at 2-2 when Alexei Zhitnik intercepted
a clearing pass on a Sabres power play and whipped it past goalie
Ed Belfour on the glove side at 5:36.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Sabres took a 1-0 lead at 7:27 of the second period
on a power-play goal by Peca. Uncovered below the left-wing
face-off circle after coming from behind the net, Peca called for
the puck and got it from Jason Woolley. Peca's shot from a bad
angle got past Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the period, Dallas began to create more
scoring chances and the Stars forced the Sabres to take penalties.
They killed them off, but the Stars tied the score at even strength
at 18:29. Scoring it was Jamie Langenbrunner, who stood in front of
the crease and deflected a shot by Richard Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
   The first period ended with a fight involving several players
that began when the Stars jostled Hasek for the second time.
Earlier, Skrudland was penalized for knocking over the Buffalo
goalie when they met in the corner in a chase for a loose puck at
12:25.
</P>
<P>
   At the buzzer, Modano's leg became entangled with Hasek's and
Hasek went down. As Modano was being penalized for tripping,
several players joined the fray, with the Dallas captain, Hatcher,
bloodying the face of Buffalo defenseman Richard Smehlik while
others paired off.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek and Belfour, the opposing goalies, stood near each other,
exchanging words, while the officials kept watch. The fighting
majors went to Brian Holzinger of Buffalo and Nieuwendyk. Smehlik
and Hatcher got roughing minors while Zhitnik was charged with
cross-checking.

COWBOYS DECIDE TO OFFER EXTENSION TO SANDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Though a timetable for his return after ``rare''
toe surgery is uncertain, there is no longer any doubt about
cornerback Deion Sanders' future with the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Thursday that he will ``take the
risk'' and work to sign the several-time All-Pro Sanders to a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can tell me when he'll be back or when he'll be
healthy,'' Jones said. ``But it is my belief that Deion is going to
play this year. And if that's the case, I want to try to work
something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sanders nor his agent, Eugene Parker, was available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the team is negotiating with Parker. The Cowboys
probably will try to work out a multiyear deal that gives Sanders a
large signing bonus and a low base salary over the next few years
to clear salary-cap room.
</P>
<P>
   However, it won't be a low-budget contract. Sanders has said he
won't sign for less than market value, which could mean a contract
averaging more than $7 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has a base salary of $6.5 million for the 1999 season.
Jones had been planning to extend his deal since the end of the
season to free up salary-cap room.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery April 27, Sanders was given a best-case prognosis
of four to six months for his return. Doctors suggested the
possibility that Sanders might never play again.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said nothing has happened to change
the original prognosis, and said Sanders' rehabilitation is going
as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has progressed as we thought it would since the
surgery,'' Maurer said. ``We haven't had any setbacks, and that's
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   However, after the surgery, Jones became hesitant about signing
Sanders to a long-term extension.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that the Cowboys possibly would waive Sanders to
save money, considering that they need more salary-cap room to sign
their rookie draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones Thursday backed off any notion of releasing Sanders, and
said restructuring was in the best interest of the Cowboys and
Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said I would waive him,'' Jones said. ``And I know
firsthand how much Deion wants to compete and help us win. Never
did I think that Deion can't dramatically help the team.''
Irvin expected at minicamp
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he expects wide receiver Michael
Irvin to take part in the team's three-day minicamp June 15-17.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who has a year remaining on his contract, has given the
Cowboys permission to trade him. At issue are his reduced role in
the Cowboys' offense, the fact that the Cowboys tried to trade him
before the draft and the team's decision not to give him a contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin did not participate in any of the team's voluntary
off-season coaching sessions, which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who said he has not talked to Irvin in more than a week,
said ``everybody'' is required to be at minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see everybody,'' Gailey said, when asked
specifically about Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones, however, said he was more concerned that Irvin is
at training camp, set for July 26, than minicamp. He said he hopes
to have the situation resolved one way or another by then.

MAVERICKS FINED FOR TREATING TRENT AND FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The NBA responded to Don Nelson's lavish treatment of
free-agent forward Gary Trent and his family by fining the
Mavericks $25,000 yesterday for violating the league's salary-cap
rules and other provisions of the collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Nelson provided an all-expenses-paid trip to
Maui, Hawaii, for Trent and Trent's son, mother, father, fiancee
and future mother-in-law. The league said because Trent is a free
agent, Nelson was in violation of league rules.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and general manager, returned to
Dallas yesterday after a three-day stay in Chicago for the predraft
camp. He said he was unaware he had violated any rules when he gave
Trent and his family the red-carpet treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure why I've been penalized, but I have, and we'll
accept it and go on,'' Nelson said. ``I thought I could take my own
player anywhere I wanted but evidently I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he spoke with NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik on
Wednesday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him that I didn't know about the rules, and if
there were any rules, I've never seen any,'' Nelson said. ``I
explained my side, and that I was upfront and I wasn't trying to
hide anything. I was open and honest about us and what we did with
Gary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, we have to fine you to set a precedent.' I
said, `Well, if you do that, I'll understand.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Trent averaged 16 points and 7.8 rebounds per game last season
and is expected to be one of the NBA's top free agents when the
free-agency period starts July 1. The most the Mavericks can offer
the fourth-year power forward is a one-year, $2 million contract,
or a two-year deal for approximately $5 million, but he probably
will attract more-lucrative, long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who admittedly never checked with the NBA before he
arranged for Trent's family to fly to Hawaii, owns a home in Maui.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still glad that I had that time together with Gary and his
mom and dad,'' Nelson said. ``We had them over for dinner the first
night, and we all got in my hot tub and sat around in my hot tub
for about half an hour talking and having a cold beer. That was
great.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get that opportunity very often. So, hopefully it'll
pay dividends.''

SPARKS RUN TO A RECORD IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ For openers, the Los Angeles Sparks made a
pretty good first impression as they dismantled the Sacramento
Monarchs to kick off their third WNBA season Thursday night at the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   It was a new look for the Sparks, who used outstanding defense
and a balanced offense to rout the Monarchs 100-78 before a crowd
of 8,262. Six players scored in double figures, with Lisa Leslie
leading with 19. Ukari Figgs and Tamecka Dixon had 14 each and
DeLisha Milton, Allison Feaster and reserve Mwadi Mabika had 11
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy,'' Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge said. ``I
thought at the beginning of the game we got caught up in the
emotion of the game. Once we calmed down and picked up the defense,
we were a lot more poised.''
</P>
<P>
   In compiling a franchise high for points in a game, the Sparks
got everyone involved, with Figgs running the point and Penny Toler
backing her up. Even Yugoslavian Gordana Grubin, who arrived
Wednesday night from Hungary, got into the action late in the game.
She pulled up for a 10-foot jumper with 6.8 seconds left for the
Sparks' final basket.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks picked apart the Monarchs, opening the game with a
10-0 run and leading by 21 with 10:18 to go. They led by 24 twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sort of wore us down,'' said Monarchs coach Sonny Allen.
``You have to give their defense credit. They have good depth
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks shot 53 percent from the field, including 10 of 18
from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' previous single-game high was 93 points against the
Monarchs two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian Nina Bjedov, who was obviously fatigued after
arriving in Los Angeles just hours before the game, was the only
Sparks player who didn't see action.

PIPELINE BLAST CREATED A RIVER OF FIRE, TOWER OF SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ A ruptured pipeline turned a creek cutting
through the heart of this city into a river of fire Thursdsay
afternoon, sending a plume of smoke 30,000 feet into the sky and
people fleeing for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a napalm drop,'' said Grant Stevens, who lives
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline-fed fire left one person dead and critically
injured two boys. The explosion, which occurred within a mile of
downtown, also temporarily closed Interstate 5 through the city.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,660 barrels, or 277,200 gallons of gasoline, spilled,
said Doug Beu, operations manager for Olympic Pipe Line Co. It was
the biggest fuel spill in the history of the pipeline, which
extends from near the Canadian Border to the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   The rupture occurred about 4:30 p.m.; fire crews already were
searching the creek after receiving reports of smells of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Pipe Line managed to shut the gasoline off, but not
until about 6 p.m., according to officials with the Whatcom County
Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   After the gasoline hit the rushing waters of Whatcom Creek, it
ignited near a city water-treatment plant sending flames through a
commercial area where many of Bellingham's car dealers are located.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a roar, like a 200-mile-an-hour gust of wind was
about to tear the roof off,'' said Mike Seymour, who was in his
shop at Windsor Plywood about 100 feet from the creek. ``We ran
outside, and the whole creek was going up. There was a series of
explosions, maybe five or six or seven, rolling down the creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like nothing you've ever seen, amazing, and then it was
just a wall of black smoke as high as you could see.''
</P>
<P>
   Two 10-year-old boys suffered deep burns over 90 percent of
their bodies, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for Harborview Medical
Center in Seattle. The boys were flown to Harborview, where they
were in critical condition in the burn intensive-care unit.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were playing in the creek when the gasoline ignited,
Zalin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a chance, but it's going to be tough for them,''
Zalin said. ``These are pretty severe ... I'd have to say they're
both going to have a very tough battle.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph Hospital in Bellingham treated two other people for
respiratory problems related to the smoke plume. They were later
released.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby Iowa Street, people ran out on the busy street to
escape the flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I saw flames shooting up. It seemed like it started
like a forest fire catching on to old brush and then it shot up 30
or 40 feet to the tops of treelines and followed along the top of
the tree line and followed across the creek,'' said Roger Anderson,
a car salesman at a Chrysler dealership on Iowa Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole street was full of people running. They are
evacuating us right now. I have to hang up!''
</P>
<P>
   People blocks away heard explosions they mistook for thunder,
then saw their lights flicker as the power was temporarily
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   From her office at the town's main library, Jane Lowery looked
out her window to the east and Iowa Street and saw a bank of black
smoke looming above the creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a picture of smoke from Mount St. Helens,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To Lane Older, who was driving home near Whatcom Creek when the
explosion occurred, the fire and smoke ``looked like the Gulf War
oilfields'' aflame.
</P>
<P>
   The flames ``went straight down the creek,'' said Rodger
Kenoyers, who owns Speedy Auto Glass near the explosion. ``There
must have been 200 feet of smoke and 100 feet of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   He drove on a road along the creek and the heat singed the hair
on his arms. ``My arms are still burned from driving down that
road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters managed to get most of the major blazes under
control by 6 p.m. and the smoke cloud had largely dissipated before
7 p.m., said Orman Darby, a spokesman for the Whatcom Cunty
Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``All civil authorities in the region have been mobilized,'' he
said. ``We don't know what caused a leak or rupture in the
pipeline. The fuel went all the way down the freeway before it
ignited, so there was quite a backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard closed Bellingham Bay for a one mile radius from
the mouth of Whatcom Creek out of concern that gas or fuel might
have gotten around dock pilings and boats, Darby said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of investigators from the state Ecology Department were
dispatched to the scene to review what happened and to clean up the
spill, said spokeswoman Sandy Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Pacific's pulp mill in Bellingham, where 850 people are
employed, remained shut down out of concern that more fuel could
come down the creek, said Darby, who also works for the mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It initially went down because the explosion caused a major
power dropout, and the mill's power plant has to be manually
restarted,'' Darby said. ``It's costly to shut down, but they did
so out of the interest of safety to personnel and equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Western Washington University will hold its graduation Saturday.
Parents and other family members were already starting to arrive
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The graduation is schedule to proceed, university officials
said. The campus is three miles from the site of the fire. The
smoke had little effect on the university.
</P>
<P>
   The fire did destroy one home near the creek on Valencia Street
and a water treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded that the damage is this incredibly light. If the
cloud cover weren't so high the smoke might have moved over the
city and that could have caused a lot of accidents and injuries,''
said Bill Quehrn, with the county's Emergency Management Division.
</P>
<P>
   In its wake, the explosion also blackened the creek's greenbelt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creek looks like the face of the moon now,'' said Seymour,
whose shop is along Whatcom Creek. ``Trees are just skeletons, and
all the fish are dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in there walking the creek bed and it was charred as
wide as this road on either side,'' added Bellingham police officer
Rob Brandland. The road is 28 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   Neither investigators nor officials with the pipeline company
could explain the rupture in the 16-inch line last night.
</P>
<P>
   But Quehrn, of the Emergency Management Division, said ``Police
say they have some leads but I don't know what that means.''
</P>
<P>
   Beu, the operations manager with Olympic Pipe Line, said he
didn't know what ignited the gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gasoline is pretty volatile. It does ignite if it finds a
source of ignition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's spokeswoman Joann Hamick said the company's
control center in Renton noticed the problem when instruments
detected a drop in the line's pressure. The system shut the
pipeline down shortly before an Olympic crewman called in to report
seeing the leak.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the crew member called back again to say
``he was running from the scene and it (the line) was on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Beu said the company had had no troubles in that area recently
with the line, which moves gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from
northern Puget Sound oil refineries to shipment terminals in
Seattle and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second pipeline explosion in as many years in Whatcom
County. A natural gas pipeline _ not owned by Olympic _ ruptured
and exploded in Everson east of Bellingham in February 1996.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Brett Hull's center had gone to the locker room with a
wrist injury. His Dallas Stars were fighting for their Stanley Cup
Finals lives.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final minutes of regulation were ticking away, and the
always-dicey proposition of overtime seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Mike Modano think of Hull's game-winning goal
Thursday night at Reunion Arena?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he has to do it himself,'' Modano said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Hull did just that when his slap shot beat Buffalo's Dominik
Hasek at 17:10 of the third period, providing the difference in the
Stars' 4-2 win over the determined Sabres, an outcome that evened
the series at one game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the goals everyone wants to get,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was the biggest of his career, Hull said, ``So far,
I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have a chance to seek a bigger one this postseason after
helping Dallas avoid a 2-0 deficit as the best-of-seven series
shifts to Buffalo for Game 3 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're all disappointed after winning the first
game,'' Hasek said. ``Now, we're starting from the beginning, but I
like our chances because of home ice.''
</P>
<P>
   An empty-netter by Derian Hatcher with 25.8 seconds remaining
gave the Stars a bit of a cushion, but it came on the heels of a
scramble on the other end in which Ed Belfour, who stopped 19 of 21
shots, barely kept the Sabres from sending yet another game into
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a series,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``It's going to be this way all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, said Hitchcock, is day-to-day with an injury the coach
termed not serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not out for the series, hopefully,'' Hitchcock said.
``The doctors want to see if it is something that settles down.''
</P>
<P>
   But the All-Star center wasn't quite ready to dismiss the
problem, which resulted from a collision with Sabres defenseman Jay
McKee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jammed it on the boards pretty good,'' he said. ``It's a
little bit tender and sore. It's playoff hockey, day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   A relatively uneventful first period ended on a livelier note as
emotions spilled over at the horn.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, who earlier drew a charge from Brian Skrudland in the
corner, went down again when Modano flipped him near the crease in
the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely a cheap shot by Modano,'' Sabres coach Lindy
Ruff said. ``There are ways to combat it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing mini-melee was much ado about nothing, because the
penalties canceled each other out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the emotional ante clearly had been raised after a
relatively civil Game 1 and an additional 20-minute standoff.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone responded to that early in the second period, it was
the Sabres, and Buffalo finally got tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Woolley, who scored the game-winner in overtime in Game 1,
found Michael Peca alone on the far side of Belfour, and Peca
wristed a quick shot over the late-arriving goalie to make it 1-0
at 7:27 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   That lead held up for more than 10 minutes, but the Stars
finally came alive as Jamie Langenbrunner evened the score at 1
when he deflected a Richard Matvichuk blast past Hasek at 18:26.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got a rare goal from defenseman Craig Ludwig at 4:25 of
the third period to take a 2-1 lead, but it didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Within a minute, Daryl Sydor was in the penalty box for a high
stick, and Alexei Zhitnik made the Stars pay when he picked up the
rebound of a Curtis Brown slap shot and poked it past Belfour to
tie the score at 2 at 5:36.
</P>
<P>
   The game seemed headed into overtime as the Stars flailed away,
but Hull finally found a bit of open space just inside the post and
blasted a shot past Hasek to allow Dallas to leave home with a
split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept coming,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation, and a big slap shot, finally paid off, better late
than never.

DENYING FRESHMEN WOULD HURT THEIR CAREERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NCAA is considering a vote to make men's basketball players
sit out their freshman year. Not freshman women's basketball
players, mind you. Not freshman men's baseball players. Or freshman
men's lacrosse team players. Or freshman cheerleaders. Or freshman
swimmers. Or freshmen who want to be on the university debate team.
</P>
<P>
   Just freshman men's basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   It's an absurd measure.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's stated reason for doing this is in the name of
education _ too few male basketball players graduate compared with
other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right!
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that a resolution to sideline freshman men's
basketball players is a shot at all of the underclassmen who leave
school early for a chance at the NBA. By keeping a blue-chip
recruit on the sidelines until he is a sophomore, you, in effect,
put his NBA future and earning power on hold while ensuring the
college he attends gets his services for at least two, maybe three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies two major problems.
</P>
<P>
   First, if men's college basketball players should not be allowed
to play as freshmen, then shouldn't the ruling apply to all
freshman athletes, male and female, in all sports? This is, to be
sure, a legal Pandora's box waiting to be opened.
</P>
<P>
   Second, and most important, why should athletes who are good
enough to jump to the NBA after their freshman or sophomore years
be penalized? If college is supposed to prepare you to make a
living, why legislate against those who have the potential to make
a very large living at a very young age?
</P>
<P>
   Because, say the proponents of the measure, a recent study
indicated that only 41 percent of male Division I basketball
players who entered college in 1991 achieved their degrees,
compared with 57 percent for all Division I athletes. The
graduation rate for black college basketball players was even
lower, 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one, not the athletes in question, nor their educators,
should be proud of this statistic.
</P>
<P>
   But who are we fooling? Legislation to ensure that a
student-athlete stays in school at least three or four years won't
ensure that student a college degree _ or a nonathletic occupation.
</P>
<P>
   If college presidents really cared about education, they would
pay closer attention to the student-athletes their basketball
coaches recruit in the first place. But that's too much to ask for.
</P>
<P>
   College presidents know that by limiting their talent base, they
might be sidelining the next Michael Jordan or Mike Bibby _ both of
whom led their schools to national championships as freshmen. This
would adversely impact a school's won-loss record, which in turn
would limit the amount of money coming into the school's coffers
from television exposure and shoe contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the college presidents mean well. But to me, the issue
that will be discussed in Chicago in two weeks by a 27-member NCAA
panel looks too much like a veiled approach to keep minority
athletes from quickly climbing the financial ladder.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a black athlete, how can you think anything else?
</P>
<P>
   First, the NCAA mandated college boards to regulate who is and
who isn't eligible to play college sports. Those tests are arguably
culturally biased and have closed the door for thousands of
minority students who dreamed of playing Division I college
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   (Interestingly enough, earlier this year a U.S. district judge
ordered the NCAA to stop using minimum standardized-test scores in
determining freshman eligibility. I wrote in March that there
should be a national standard on test scores, but that maybe the
NCAA should use tests that are more culturally diverse.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the NCAA _ tired of all of their talented underclassmen
basketball players passing up their years of college eligibility
for a chance to play in the NBA _ wants to, in effect, tell a kid
how long he has to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   I'd feel better if those whiners who complain about basketball
players going pro after their freshmen season voiced similar
complaints about athletes from other sports. Society does not raise
a big fuss about all of the tennis players who go pro as
teen-agers, or all of the hockey and baseball players who forgo
college to start pursuing their dreams on the minor-league levels.
</P>
<P>
   But they do have a big problem with basketball players _ or
shall we say more plainly ``black kids'' _ leaving early.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and squirm as you read this.
</P>
<P>
   But let it soak in a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: The NCAA should allow all student-athletes who
qualify academically to play any sport.
</P>
<P>
   And leave it to the NBA to worry about the influx of
underclassmen into the league.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BELIEVE whomever you want. Or believe no one. Believe everything.
Or believe nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Believe Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. bared his soul,
revealing his feelings toward Hispanics a week ago, and then tried
to backtrack out of the mess when he realized he got caught.
</P>
<P>
   Or believe McLane was an innocent victim entangled in the
ugliest of misunderstandings. He fell victim to an exaggerated
report about what was another run-of-the-mill marketing spiel.
</P>
<P>
   Demand an apology. Or ask for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the inevitable truth about the words McLane shared with
Telemundo executives a week ago is this: No matter if reality lies
with McLane's version of the story, with the Telemundo executives'
version or somewhere in between, damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   This issue will not go away quietly. Ignore this, and it will
fester. Give it only lip service, and some in the community will
resent the token concern.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to what was said or wasn't said at the fateful
reception where McLane spoke with KTMD general manager Marco
Camacho, it all comes down to one's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Mine remains that something was said that caused Telemundo to
run with the story. Something inflammatory had to have been said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine anyone would be so shallow, so
contemptible, to fabricate such a life-changing allegation for the
sake of attention and maybe some ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Your opinion might be different. Fine. People can disagree _
that's why we live in this country, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is the discussion in question was indeed
fateful. Now comes the damage repair. And repairing this might be
as big a personal test for McLane as the emotional test he has felt
in the past week. It will be a long and arduous time. For some,
maybe nothing the Astros do from this point forward will help.
That's their choice, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent talk with McLane in the aftermath of the
Telemundo report, he recognized the need to do something big,
something significant, in an attempt to make everyone realize that
no matter what happened, things will be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always tried to be tough on the issues, not tough on
people,'' McLane said. ``This is an issue. This has become a great,
huge issue, and it's painful to me that it has. I'm not mad; I'm
hurting. I don't want to argue about who said what. I want to
change what people think about the Astros for whatever reason they
think it.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend when the Astros open a homestand against the San
Diego Padres _ a team that has long and successfully marketed
to &UR;  &LR; its Hispanic community _ McLane said he will invite numerous
Hispanic leaders to suggest ideas about where the club should go in
its relationship with the Hispanic community. He says he personally
will look into the Astros' Spanish-language broadcast marketing
strategy and try to decide, ``Are we doing it the right way?''
</P>
<P>
   There will be a youth baseball clinic targeting Hispanics this
weekend, with first-base coach Jose Cruz and outfielder Richard
Hidalgo conducting.
</P>
<P>
   He says he will instruct vice president for marketing Pam
Gardner to pursue discussions with the Padres and Los Angeles
Dodgers, another team entrenched in its Hispanic community, in an
attempt to develop ideas about how to raise the Astros' presence
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job now is to put a bridge between all of this,'' McLane
said. ``We have to get the Hispanic community back.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be impossible. Resentment and questions remain
regarding the fateful words McLane spoke, how Major League Baseball
responded and how the Astros look in their aftermath. The moves
McLane has decided to make toward soothing feelings are but baby
steps.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the scarcity of Hispanics in upper-management
positions with the club, McLane pointed to numerous
lower-management minorities, saying, ``We have a high rating
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But is that enough for those who think McLane bared his soul?
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the way baseball commissioner Bud Selig glossed over
the issue by defending McLane without speaking to Camacho or
Telemundo, McLane said: ``I really was not involved in that. I just
told (Selig) what I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of people were there a week ago to hear what
McLane said. Looking back on that night, McLane was asked to try to
dissect the conversation. Was there anything he can remember that
might have been wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were any mistakes, it's because I'm very open,'' he
said. ``Maybe it was just fanned by the way it was interpreted,
making it sound extreme. When you get into a group like that, it
can be inflamed and someone can jump to conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe what you want. But believe only one person can make it
better: Drayton McLane Jr.

STARS TAKE PHYSICAL ROUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Buffalo Sabres played the part of the bully on the
beach in the first game of the Stanley Cup Finals, repeatedly
kicking sand in the faces of the meek Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Last night in Game 2, the Stars kicked back in their 4-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   After taking 16 more hits than they dished out in the series
opener, the Stars got physical. They delivered 48 hits while taking
38, including 30 in the first period when they set the tone for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our goal to be more physical,'' said Stars defenseman
Richard Matvichuk, who was credited with three hits.
</P>
<P>
   There was more to the game plan than revenge.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the physical battle in the first game, the Sabres got
the Stars on their heels. Buffalo took control in the third period,
finding open ice that wasn't there in the first two.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars began to change things in the first period last night.
Their 30 hits in the period were of the hard, bone-jarring variety,
and 18 of them were delivered by the forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get some hits on their defensemen,'' said Mike
Keane, who had five hits in the first period and a team-high six
for the game. ``I felt we gave them a day off in Game 1. No
defenseman likes to handle the puck when someone's bearing down on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the physical play flowed from the Stars' attitude. After
losing Game 1, they were in a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last game we were hoping to win,'' Keane said. ``Tonight we
were desperate to win. It's just a matter of playing hard. We had
to battle back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are walking a fine line with the physical play. They
want to slow down the Sabres while sending a message, but they
can't afford to take penalties and put the dangerous Buffalo power
play on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to play our aggressive style, but we're trying to
do it within the rules,'' Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   They took seven penalties last night, but most were for tripping
and high-sticking, not rough play.
</P>
<P>
   One of the penalties for rough stuff came after a hit on Sabres
goalie Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek strayed far from his goal to play a puck almost all the
way in the corner in the first period, and was hit from behind by
Brian Skrudland, who drew a charging penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hasek plays the puck, he sticks his body out to shield
the player,'' Keane said. ``We're not trying to run him. That's not
part of our game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was hit later in the period by Joe Nieuwendyk, who slid
into the goalie while going after a rebound. He went down again in
the waning seconds when he was tripped from behind by Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars said they weren't going after Hasek, but were just
following their plan to get more traffic in front of him to try and
score on deflections and rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the game plan of every team to bother the goalie, but
I don't think we're trying to run him,'' forward Guy Carbonneau
said.
</P>
<P>
   The hits on Hasek led to the Stars' first fight of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner got in Hasek's face when the goalie went in
search of a referee to complain after being tripped by Modano.
Sabres defenseman Richard Smehlik flew after Langenbrunner and hit
him, and players paired off all over the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk and Sabres forward Brian Holzinger dropped the
gloves, and Nieuwendyk landed a couple of punches before it was
broken up.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the hits _ both legal and illegal _ and the
fight stirred up some bad blood between two teams that only played
each other twice in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play a couple of games to get that dislike for a
team, and I guess we've got that now,'' Keane said.

HIGH-PROFILE PROSTITUTION RING CRACKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cracking a high-priced prostitution ring that
catered to Hollywood's elite and Los Angeles business leaders,
police said that they have arrested Jody ``Baby Doll'' Gibson and
seized her client list.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 41, described as a longtime associate of convicted
Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, was arrested Tuesday by male officers
posing as clients during a meeting at the Century Plaza Hotel near
Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the resident of Palo Verde on the
California-Arizona border ran her call-girl empire out of a San
Fernando Valley hotel when she was in Los Angeles and had mail
drops in Toluca Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Men arranged meetings with women on an Internet site or an 800
number, and they paid between $500 and $3,000 per night or more,
detectives said. Reams of paperwork, computer files and her ``black
book'' were confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation and the information we have at this point
shows that several Hollywood actors, CEOs of major Fortune 500
companies and one athlete, at least at this point, were on the
client list,'' said Lt. Mike Felix of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to the names were listed their ages, where they were
located and whether they had any fetishes or special requests.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said her driver's license stated her name as Jody Babydol
Diane Gibson. Detectives said Gibson, also known as ``Sasha'' and
``Baby Doll,'' ran the high-priced ring since at least the late
1980s and has an association with Fleiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to documents that we seized _ if what she wrote is
true _ Heidi applied for a job with her service before her troubles
began in the early '90s and was turned down. Heidi then began her
own endeavors as competition for Gibson,'' Felix said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is among five operators of major prostitution rings in
Los Angeles, according to detectives. She is believed to have taken
in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's big in Los Angeles, and very big on the East Coast,
too,'' said Detective Keith Haight. ``We know she is operating in
at least 16 states.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is accused of employing 34 women in Los Angeles and at
least six in Europe, including well-known pornographic actresses,
detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interviewing the girls now, and it could very well lead
to the men who hired them,'' Haight said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to get into her operation with undercover
officers,'' Haight said. ``An undercover female officer was hired,
then directed to have sex with her clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Three accused prostitutes were arrested and released on bail,
police said. Their names were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Gibson would send escorts from Los Angeles wherever
her clients wished. Clients would call an 800 number that would
ring at her home to place orders, Haight said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was done by phone. There are no offices,'' Haight
said.
</P>
<P>
   Her Web site, accessed only through a password, displayed
photographs of women who could be ordered over the phone, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the dates, the women kept 40 percent of the fee and sent
the rest to mail drops. Gibson would come to the Valley twice a
month to pick up her cash and interview prospective employees,
Haight said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was booked at the Van Nuys Jail on suspicion of pimping
and pandering and was released on $25,000 bail, police said.
Arraignment is scheduled for Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Officers in the LAPD's organized crime and vice divisions have
been watching Gibson since 1990, Haight said. In 1994, they
discovered she was an associate of Fleiss, but their involvement
with each other remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if they were in business together, or friends,
or traded trade secrets,'' Haight said. ``We have stacks of diaries
and paperwork that we're trying to piece through to figure out
their connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Their investigation began in earnest earlier this year when
detectives received an anonymous complaint from a woman that
Gibson's escorts were offering sex, Haight said. Investigators
believe the caller was a disgruntled prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the undercover female officer who worked for
Gibson, two male officers placed orders for escorts and were
offered sex, Haight said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   She is the first high-profile madam arrested since Fleiss, who
was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison in January 1997.
Fleiss was convicted of tax evasion, conspiracy and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Fleiss, 33, was accused of generating more than $600,000 by
running a call-girl ring in which the rich, famous and powerful
paid $1,500 to $7,500 for an evening with one of her prostitutes.

BURROUGHS FANS UP TO USUAL MONKEY BUSINESS AT TARZAN CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - A record number of Edgar Rice Burroughs fans were
going ape Thursday at the 38th annual Tarzan convention.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' movie this
weekend, about 150 Lord of the Apes fanatics attended the show at
the Warner Center Marriott in the Woodland Hills community of Los
Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The convention is officially called a dum-dum, the word for the
ceremonial gathering of great apes in the Tarzan books. Tarzan,
Lord Greystoke, is the only human being who ever joined in the
fierce, mad, intoxicating ape revel.
</P>
<P>
   Trading stories of the jungle and feeding their addiction for
Tarzan books and paraphernalia, attendees set a mark for the
highest turnout in the 38-year history of the Edgar Rice Burroughs
Bibliophiles Literary Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our 1996 convention, we only had 106 people,'' said Scott
Tracy Griffin, the event's chairman and founder of the Southern
California chapter of the Burroughs Bibliophiles, the L.A. SubERBs.
``The lure of Tarzana really brings them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs, sometimes called the ``the grandfather of science
fiction,'' published 77 novels and short stories between 1912 and
1965. There have been more than 60 film adaptations of his literary
works.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs lived on the spectacular Tarzana Ranch, located in
what is now the San Fernando Valley community of Tarzana, said
73-year-old Bob Hyde, president of the national Burroughs
Bibliophiles. Burroughs died March 15, 1950, while reading a Tarzan
comic.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, held in various places around the country, has a
special draw when it is held near Burroughs' former home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a spiritual homeland for us,'' Griffin said. ``It's a
chance to walk hallowed literary ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention lasts through Sunday and features a dealers'
forum of rare Burroughs items, as well as field trips, artists and
writers. The public has access to the books and paraphernalia for
free. Full admission, which includes a preview of the movie, a
Saturday banquet and dinner at the Tarzana home of Burroughs'
grandson, Danton, costs $70.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs addicts could purchase plastic-wrapped books such as
``Tarzan the Untamed'' for $75 and ``John Carter of Mars'' for
$125.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Brown, a teacher from Willows, Calif., talked about the
lure of such treasures. ``There were times I would wait in bed
nervous and sweating because I got a Tarzan catalog in the mail and
I couldn't call to order stuff because it was too early in the
morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said first editions of Burroughs' books can fetch from
$5,500 to $55,000. With the release of the movie, the value of
Tarzan books and memorabilia is expected to rise even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started collecting in 1979,'' Brown said. ``Books I paid $25
for then are now worth $100 to $200 in their dust jackets. A couple
of weeks ago I spent $750 for a carload of Tarzan stuff. It wasn't
until I starting selling some of this stuff that my wife became a
believer in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another believer at the show is 53-year-old Alta Loma resident
and teacher Mike Shaw, a tall and tanned Tarzan look-alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fortitude, Tarzan was able to overcome the problems he
was facing,'' he said. ``I love that attitude, and I love the
doodads, also.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ORLANDO, Fla. _ The relative health of the Comets came under
question in recent days as they approached their WNBA season opener
against the expansion Orlando Miracle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper sprained her ankle in practice Wednesday, and
Sheryl Swoopes had expressed concern about a sick defense that had
not performed up to Comets standards in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard was a suspect position with starter Kim Perrot
sidelined because of her battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, before an enthusiastic crowd of 15,422 at
the Orlando Arena, the Comets, despite Cooper reinjuring her ankle
in the first half and two teammates getting banged up, recorded a
77-63 victory that indicated that perhaps the earlier concerns were
unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little frustrated when I got hurt,'' said Cooper, who
had to leave the game briefly at 11:34 of the first half. ``I was
ready mentally to play, then I go and hurt my ankle. I was a little
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But tell you what, the team came out and played great. Tina
Thompson, wow. She shot the ball, did it all tonight. And that's
what it takes for us to win. When one person is down, that's why
we're so hard to stop. When someone is down, someone else steps
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping gingerly on her right ankle all night, Cooper went
4-for-6 from the 3-point line and led all scorers with 24 points.
</P>
<P>
   When she had trouble with her mobility and difficulty shooting
the ball, she found other ways to help. Cooper added a game-high
seven assists and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a gutsy effort by Cynthia,'' Comets coach Van
Chancellor said, ``playing on the ankle that she could not walk on
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, I was really concerned because she started
out with no hobble and then she went to a bad hobble. That worried
me to death. But I should have known Cooper was going to make
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also did a little of everything. She scored 22 points,
pulled down 12 rebounds and was 3-for-5 from beyond the arc in the
first half, picking up the slack for Cooper with 17 of her 22
points in the half.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Swoopes. With Orlando mounting a charge in
the second half after trailing by as many as 13 points in the
opening half, Swoopes scored six of her 18 points during a 12-0
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheryl just gives us so much,'' Cooper said. ``She shoots off
the dribble; she posts up. She's so quick. And in the tough moments
of the game, she just steps it up and really helps the team get
back on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Superlatives are usually expected from Cooper, Swoopes and
Thompson. But Sonja Henning, although scoring only two points,
teamed with Janeth Arcain to give Chancellor a strong showing from
the point position. Henning had four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about Sonja for coming in and playing
hard,'' Chancellor said. ``You can't say enough about Arcain for
the game she had.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper started and was playing well until nine minutes into the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while scoring on a driving layup, she came down and
stepped on a cameraperson seated along the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cooper, who was fouled by rookie Nykesha Sales as she
made the basket, righted herself long enough to complete the
three-point play, she then was taken to the bench for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   She would return later, but Thompson stepped up to fill the
void, scoring 11 of the Comets' first 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   With Cooper on the sideline, Thompson dropped in back-to-back
3-pointers and Polina Tzekova (six points, four rebounds) followed
a miss by Arcain, Cooper's replacement, with a bucket that made it
32-19.
</P>
<P>
   That was part of a 10-0 Comets run that saw the lead grow to
37-19. But with Cooper back and limping noticeably, the Comets had
difficulty on defense and in solving the half-court pressure
defense of the Miracle.
</P>
<P>
   What proved to be the biggest hurdle for the Comets, however,
was three fouls on center Monica Lamb within the final 1:14 of the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the fouls were against Taj McWilliams, one of the many
former American Basketball League players who fill the lineup of
the Miracle.
</P>
<P>
   McWilliams, who led the Miracle with 15 points, made four
consecutive free throws as Orlando trimmed the lead to 41-32.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by McWilliams with 7.6 seconds left before
intermission brought the Miracle to within 41-34.
</P>
<P>
   But Tzekova, re-entering the game in place of Lamb, came up with
a monster follow shot.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-pointer by Swoopes missed badly, but Tzekova, in one motion,
leaped to grab the carom and in midair connected to give the Comets
a 43-35 advantage at intermission.

M'S ON RECORD PACE, BUT LONG BALLS A MIXED BLESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Monday night's 4-2 Mariners win over the Colorado
Rockies was perhaps the most incongruous outcome of the season, and
not just because it came at the ear-popping elevation of Coors
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Hit-and-run plays. Trickery on the base paths. Singles the
opposite way. For just the third time this season, Seattle won a
game without hitting a home run. Nice to play that kind of
baseball, isn't it, Lou Piniella?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners manager, who knows better, smiled and said,
``That'll change.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, it did. Before they had made their first
out Tuesday, the Mariners were bashing again, off to a two-homer,
six-run first inning and their 14th game scoring 10 or more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Power's a good thing,'' Piniella said. ``The home-run ball,
when it comes, is a thing of beauty. But when it doesn't, and you
don't advance the runners, and you leave them in scoring position,
you get situations like the San Diego series, when we left about 25
men on base those first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team can strand baserunners, but when you make outs not
advancing people, they're not in position to score when the base
hits come. The secret is to have a combination of hitters in your
lineup to give you more opportunities to advance runners when you
make outs. And we really don't have that type of lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have more balance if you did, but certainly, you
wouldn't hit the home runs that we do.''
</P>
<P>
   And do they ever. In 1997, the Mariners set a major league
record with 264 home runs, getting 45 percent of their runs from
the long ball. Last year's team hit 234, tops in the majors, and
scored 43 percent of its runs on homers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the M's are on pace for 330 homers and have scored 51
percent of their runs on home runs. Seattle reached 100 homers
faster than any team in history, doing so in game No. 50, and has
118 homers for the season. That's more than the Florida Marlins,
Minnesota Twins, Pittsburgh Pirates and Tampa Bay Devil Rays had in
all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually with National League clubs, at least two or three guys
in your lineup are speed and defense guys. They may hit one out,
but not a lot,'' said Kevin Towers, San Diego Padres general
manager. ``But every guy in their lineup can hurt you with the long
ball. That's nice _ you could be down two or three runs, and with
that type of lineup, you could be up two or three in an inning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have one or two guys who can hit it out, you can be a
little extra careful with those guys and not give in to them,''
said Milt May, Colorado Rockies pitching coach. ``But when a team
has four or five guys in a row, like the Mariners, you have to
pitch to somebody. You can pitch around one. You can't pitch around
four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lineup that's perfect if you enjoy anonymity. The
Mariners have six players with 10 or more home runs _ Ken Griffey
Jr. (23), David Bell (14), Russ Davis (14), Butch Huskey (11),
Edgar Martinez (10) and Alex Rodriguez (10). That's just what
Huskey was expecting when he was traded from the New York Mets to
Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what was exciting for me?'' Huskey said. ``What I
really thought of was that I could come over here and fit in and
almost be a guy that no one thinks is going to hit the ball,
because they already had Junior, Edgar, Jay (Buhner), Alex, Russ
and (David) Segui. Then you throw me in there, I can almost be a
sleeper in the lineup, and that's the way I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleeper? That was more like a sleeper hold Huskey put on a Mark
Brownson pitch two batters after Griffey's blast on Tuesday. Huskey
hit the ball 458 feet, the longest homer for the M's this year
until Griffey hit one 20 feet deeper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Huskey, like most in the Mariners clubhouse, feels a need
almost to apologize for the home runs. Huskey said the Mets never
lost four dozen baseballs every batting practice, as his new team
does, but reliance on the homer can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll kill you,'' he said. ``But I think this team has the
capability of doing the little things when we have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Dan Wilson is one of the most reliable hitters in
executing the hit-and-run, and he also has a team-high five
sacrifice hits. Wilson has hit just three homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be some periods where home runs aren't
going to be there,'' Wilson said. ``Any time you can get out of the
double-play situation or get a guy over to third base so a fly ball
can score him, that helps. When you have a team that can hit home
runs and win close games, too, that's the mark of a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Jesse Barfield has tried to stress those so-called
little things. Barfield's instructor in Toronto, Cito Gaston,
taught his hitters to make ``smart outs'' that advance runners or
make the pitcher work. Imparting that message to his hitters is now
Barfield's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where we should be, but we're getting there,''
Barfield said. ``The tougher pitchers are going to slow down the
home run a little bit, and that's why you have to do the little
things. (Baltimore's) Mike Mussina, he owned this ballclub, and we
did the little things to beat him. We had to go the other way
against him, because he pitches that way. And it's not just
Mussina, but a lot of the better pitchers are like that. If you
make outs against them with smart at-bats, no one can say much.''
</P>
<P>
   As great as it is to hit home runs, Barfield points out that
homers also can stop momentum, clearing the bases and giving the
pitcher a break. That's why a merry-go-round of base-runners
becomes so important.
</P>
<P>
   And why, as staggering as the Mariners' home-run totals are, the
team always will be hamstrung unless the offense is well-rounded.
That won't happen easily, because home-run hitters naturally hit
more fly balls and strike out more often.
</P>
<P>
   But it must happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you keep constant pressure on a pitcher is (with) a
steady stream of baserunners,'' Piniella said. ``He's got to make
better pitches; he's going to work harder. Nothing's more
demoralizing to a pitcher than making a pitch down and away with
two runners on and seeing it sliced down the line for a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, there's a need for home runs. But the best type of
offense is one that's got a blend of both.''
</P>

   PRISTINA _ If cliches were permitted in places like Pristina,
city of fear would not be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are rifle shots in the empty streets, loud, close at hand,
from somewhere behind the 15th-century Imperial Mosque. There is
the constant roar of NATO jets and a thump of bombs in the hills
around Kosovo's capital that changes the air pressure on Marshal
Tito street.
</P>
<P>
   There are acres of looted houses, homes to the persecuted
Albanians, two of whom I met _ still I wonder at their courage _
walking down the Corso arm-in-arm, a husband and his pregnant wife
waiting for their day of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the Serbs, fearful of their future, unable to sell
their homes, tens of thousands of them, still unable to grasp what
Yugoslavia's ``peace'' with NATO really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians are coming with NATO,'' a blond girl said.
``This will become an Albanian city.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, of course, is quite unconcerned by the fate of Kosovo's
remaining 100,000 Serbs _ mostly civilians and innocent of the
crimes of Serb militiamen _ and is already talking blandly of their
``probable'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   First the Kosovo Albanians were ``ethnically cleansed'' by the
Serbs. And in a few days _ two weeks at most _ the Serbs will be
``ethnically cleansed'' by NATO's Albanian allies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have both promised to protect Serbs as well as Albanians in
this dark land. Both will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving around is not safe _ you have to know that,'' an army
major told us frankly.
</P>
<P>
   I have the impression that Pristina is already lost to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there are the heroes. Two of them were the Albanian
couple and another was a reservist soldier called Zoren Brankovic
who runs the biggest key-cutting shop in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A big, bespectacled man with a large tummy that strained at his
army vest, Brankovic pointed to the single-story yellow-painted
house on Ruga Zejtaret with its ornate stucco work above the three
front windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was born here and I was born here and all the
Brankovic's lived in this small area,'' he said. And he pointed to
the mass of rubble at one end of the street _ NATO's work _ in
which his cousin had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I will never leave. This is my home _ my very own home
which belongs to our family. I have a brother here and a wife and
three sons and we want to live here with our Albanian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian people of Pristina were never a problem _ the
money of the KLA and the mafia is the problem. Everyone came to my
shop _ Albanians, Turks, Serbs, Montenegrans...''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking past the bombed-out post office _ NATO's work again _ we
found Marjana and her boyfriend Nikola, arms draped around each
other, she holding a red-yellow rose on a long stem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I leave when this is my home and my country?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola, who was at work in the Jugopetrol plant when NATO
destroyed it in April, talked about the Orthodox monastery at
Gracanina and admitted he wanted to marry Miljana with her long
brown hair and the rose which he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should never have stopped the war when they did,'' the
girl said suddenly. And there was another of those loud, echoing
rifle shots. Who was shooting at who, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   They shrugged. But I suspect their ignorance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a shrewd, unpleasant suspicion that the Kosovo Liberation
Army are not waiting for NATO to enter Pristina to stake their
claim. I think they are already here, amid the houses of the
dispossessed, waiting to move before a single British paratrooper
marches down Marshal Tito Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not far from Urosevac _ scarcely 15 miles from here _
the Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai drove into an ambush Tuesday
morning, receiving a bullet wound in his leg along with his Serb
driver Ivan Cvejic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fired 20 bullets at a bus on the Pristina-Prizren road a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   So what life is left for the Serbs here? For mile after mile
Tuesday, I drove alone through an abandoned Kosovo on the road from
Raca, the Albanian homes long incinerated by the Serbs _ though one
was burning away in a field, a bright orange fire blooming from its
windows _ and just one Serb family sitting on the porch of their
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are already moving through Pristina that the Serbian
government will not allow the 100,000 Serbs to leave Kosovo, that
the cities of central Serbia cannot absorb more refugees (Kraljevo,
they say, has already taken 6,000 to add to the thousands from
Krajina in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm was darkening the skies as I approached Luzane
and fingers of lightening were touching the still bright, empty
meadows to the west. On the bombed-out bridge still lay the
skeleton of that terrible bus _ the Pristina-Nis bus that NATO
destroyed with a missile last month _ with its steel roof frame and
scorched iron seats and a boy's sodden left-hand boot on the road
beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Below, beside the river into which many of the dead were thrown
_ Serbs and Albanians alike _ I found a tangle of decaying clothes
and a spray of plastic flowers, bright crimson and yellow and
purple amid the real pale blue cornflowers of the riverbank, a
token of remembrance to the death of both Serbs and Albanians _ the
very last memorial to a Kosovo that might have been but never was.
</P>
<P>
   For they are still here, the Albanians; not many perhaps. But
the couple we stopped on the Corso Tuesday afternoon told _ between
frightened glances and the wife's nervous pleas to her husband to
stop talking and leave _ the story of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend all our time in a flat,'' he said simply. ``Day and
night. We just stay in, that is all. We move from house to house,
from flat to flat, all the time, in case they come for us. My own
brother has disappeared. I've been to the Milosevic police to ask
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   At this remark I drew in my breath, loudly. Kosovo is not a
place for the brave. ``No, I couldn't find him,'' the man muttered.
``I have lost my own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife muttered desperately again, a young woman in a long red
dress with jewelry on her hands, newly pregnant, a child conceived
amid her people's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   They turned away from us, the Albanian couple, and walked
quickly away, arm in arm, waiting for the tomorrow that they and
Zoren Brankovic, deep down in their hearts, fear more than they can
ever admit. &QL;

   GRACANICA, KOSOVO _ In the visitor's book of the 14th-century
monastery of Gracanica Wednesday morning, a Serb called Blagujevic
wrote these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesus Christ and Lord of all Kosovo Serbs _ help the
Serbs to endure this justified struggle and to save their state of
Kosovo-Metohija _ and punish all the enemies who want to destroy
your people. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO jet flew through the firmament high above us as we read
Blagujevic's prayer. There was a whisper and a low drum-roll of
sound that buried itself amid the high walls and candle-blackened
frescoes of Saint Sava and his father at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   At the door, four Yugoslav soldiers had arrived, one of them
with two crosses dangling on his chest along with his steel
military identification tag. They lay their Kalashnikov assault
rifles on top of each other by the ancient stone door and walked
silently into the church to pray for their families.
</P>
<P>
   So many prayers there are now as Kosovo's day of reckoning grows
nearer.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before, beside the Casablanca discotheque and the
monument to the eternal unity of Serbs and Kosovo Albanians _
Tito's little joke from the 1960s _ God was asked by Archbishop
Artemije of Decine to protect Kosovo's Serbs in the coming days of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 Serb men, women and children _ unemployed factory
workers, soldiers with their rifles on their backs, girlfriends and
wives and old men who once loved Tito _ crossed themselves beneath
the dreary sun.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of interior had banned this rally, they were told,
so they were meeting ``in the shrine of God, under the holy sky.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Archbishop in his long black robe told them was
this: ``We will show our true patriotism for our holy places. Don't
be frightened. Don't leave your holy place empty. A wrong
historical step cannot be corrected... Whatever happens to us, we
must stay in our homes, our villages, in our cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Moma Trajkovic, who founded the Serbian Resistance Movement in
1989 in support of President Slobodan Milosevic _ though not any
more, dear reader, not any more _ delivered a message that was
directed at NATO and the Belgrade government as well as God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending a message to those who want to take revenge _
that revenge is not the answer,'' he shouted. ``Peace cannot be
achieved by revenge but only in a shared life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for a war or for conflict but we will not be
slaughtered on our doorsteps like lambs. This is what we ask of
those who make decisions about this area _ to come between those
who would slaughter each other...
</P>
<P>
   ``Brothers and sisters, we intend before the whole world to
stay. Remaining in Kosovo is our only chance. Unfortunately, those
who brought us here will not allow us to fight. We want to organize
ourselves and to stay, no matter what the price, to stay in our
homes... If we leave Kosovo-Metohija, we shall never return,
ever.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 85 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To decode this message, God will have understood the lambs as a
reference to Muslim sacrifice, and the bit about ``those who make
decisions'' as an appeal to Milosevic and General Sir Michael
Jackson of the still virginal ``KFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   No hint, of course, as to why the returning Albanian refugees
might want to take revenge or do any lamb-like slaughtering. A
``shared life'' was not exactly on offer last month. Or even last
week. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once they had completed their prayers, we spoke with Ljuba and
his three soldier comrades from Toplica in the little cafe opposite
the gateway at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have known we were coming _ I only decided on the
trip to the monastery a few minutes earlier _ and it was we who
chose to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   These were front-line soldiers under bombing, the voice of those
whom NATO _ whom we _ are still trying to kill in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered coffee and the men sat down nervously although not
without some eagerness to talk. Ljuba was the first to launch into
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO are not fighting in uniform,'' he said. ``They are at war
against our sacred places, our factories, our bridges, our
kindergartens, our hospitals... The NATO soldiers don't have the
guts to look us in the eyes. They are cowards. We just pray to God
that they come and put their boots on our soil.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba was still praying for the ground war that NATO plans to
avoid. A bombing war was not what he wanted. ``It's tough for
everybody,'' Ljuba's colleague Srdjan said. ``No parent can say:
`It's OK _ my son is in the war.' But they know we have to preserve
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed towards the monastery. ``My father told me before I
left for the war: `Don't be a coward.' I said to him: `Don't worry
_ I won't shame my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba _ the most talkative of the four and the most thoughtful _
wanted to explain their presence. ``We went to pray for our
families' health and to pray that the NATO bombers leave them
alone. The last thing I told my wife was `take care of our son.' He
is eight-and-a-half years old. His name is Stefan. She was crying.
Just a little.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a war against Orthodox Christianity, Srdjan complained.
The Serbs were hated because they believed in forgiveness. So of
course, I mentioned the unmentionble: Albanians. And out it poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything _ more than any minority anywhere in the
world,'' Ljuba announced. ``But they cannot build their state on
Serbian soil. Would you allow Irish people to build their state in
Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   And the story followed its familiar course. The Albanian
villages had not been ``cleansed'' but were already deserted when
NATO attacked, the fires untended because of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But were there not _ I used the usual paraphrase _ some
``uncontrolled elements'' among the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, against the terrorists, yes,'' Ljuba suddenly replied.
``Against those who were shooting at us, yes. But I love my wife
and children, I couldn't hurt a woman and child. Now the UCK (KLA)
fire at us from their own columns of refugees in order to provoke
us. But normal men cannot shoot at women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   These words of Ljuba must stand against the record of death
squads and executions and dispossession that the women and children
_ whom no ``normal man'' could shoot _ have spoken of after
crossing Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was therefore a double relief when Captain Nebojsa arrived, a
realist from Yugoslavia's Third Army and the only officer in the
little cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Croatian war,'' he said. ``This is much worse
because of the bombing. In Croatia, it was man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army now is preparing for a withdrawal if the agreement is
signed. The civilians will go with us. They have started leaving
already. Those who decide to stay, I don't know what will happen to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They talk to me. They say if all the army
withdraws, they will withdraw too.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the KLA, there is no chance they will respect the
agreement because they have no chain of command and are fighting
each other for power. All along the roads now there are (KLA)
ambushes _ just in this last period, since the start of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers know what this means. They know what has happened
here. And they read a message in the monastery of Gracanica. For
Kosovo's day of reckoning has been visible on the frescoes for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the faces of Saint Sava and his father Stefan, of
King Milutin and his tragic child bride Simonida. Every Serb is
shown the Arabic script that desecrates the holy vestments. And the
painted eyes of Sava and Stefan and Milutin and Simonida which,
centuries ago, under Muslim rule, were gouged out with knives. &QL;

<P>
   ``We'll dig up our dead and take them with us,'' a Kosovo Serb
from Pristina said this week, on hearing the terms of the peace
plan. ``There's no chance the Serbs will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Serbs in Kosovo exhuming their ancestors may bury
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbian leader overthrew his predecessor, Ivan
Stambolic, in 1987, it was for being ``soft'' on the Kosovo
question, and he became the idol of Serbia with his pledges to
crush the Albanians' hopes of taking Kosovo out of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to sell his people a peace plan that ``soft'' old
Stambolic would never have dreamed of swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has performed U-turns before _ after the humiliating
defeat of the Croatians Serbs in 1995 and the subsequent Serb
exodus from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   He may pull it off again, using his grip on Radio Televisija
Serbija to hammer home the message that only his stubborn
resistance saved Serbia from occupation by NATO. Out in the
provinces they may even believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic will have to reconfigure his regime. The
ultranationalists of Vojislav Seselj's Radical party and the
Serbian Orthodox Church must go. But new partners must come on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward the secular socialists of YUL (United Yugoslav
Left), a party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana, and maybe even Vuk
Draskovic, the eccentric leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement,
chucked out of the Serbian government at the start of the war for
his doveish statements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rumors of military coups and talk of popular
disillusion, there is no obvious replacement for the man whose 12
years as leader have seen Serbia dragged ever deeper into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals inside Serbia are a group of envious, quarrelsome
political dwarfs, and while they complain about his disasters, none
ever suggested following a different course in Croatia, Bosnia or
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a revolt from within the ranks of the security
forces either. The army may be seething but the real power in
Serbia is Milosevic's large, well-armed paramilitary police. This
is the regime's Preatorian guard and it will sink or swim with its
paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest threat to Milosevic comes from the unlikely
quarter of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to have crushed that nut when he had the chance. Now he
must endure Montenegro's youthful president, Milo Djukanovic,
lecturing him about how stupid he was to take on NATO in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic plays with the idea of taking Montenegro out of
Yugoslavia. But he may decide the stay, now the Serbs are humbled,
and angle for the post of Yugoslav president himself. &QL;

<P>
   ``We'll dig up our dead and take them with us,'' a Kosovo Serb
from Pristina said this week, on hearing the terms of the peace
plan. ``There's no chance the Serbs will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Serbs in Kosovo exhuming their ancestors may bury
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbian leader overthrew his predecessor, Ivan
Stambolic, in 1987, it was for being ``soft'' on the Kosovo
question, and he became the idol of Serbia with his pledges to
crush the Albanians' hopes of taking Kosovo out of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to sell his people a peace plan that ``soft'' old
Stambolic would never have dreamed of swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has performed U-turns before _ after the humiliating
defeat of the Croatians Serbs in 1995 and the subsequent Serb
exodus from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   He may pull it off again, using his grip on Radio Televisija
Serbija to hammer home the message that only his stubborn
resistance saved Serbia from occupation by NATO. Out in the
provinces they may even believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic will have to reconfigure his regime. The
ultranationalists of Vojislav Seselj's Radical party and the
Serbian Orthodox Church must go. But new partners must come on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward the secular socialists of YUL (United Yugoslav
Left), a party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana, and maybe even Vuk
Draskovic, the eccentric leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement,
chucked out of the Serbian government at the start of the war for
his doveish statements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rumors of military coups and talk of popular
disillusion, there is no obvious replacement for the man whose 12
years as leader have seen Serbia dragged ever deeper into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals inside Serbia are a group of envious, quarrelsome
political dwarfs, and while they complain about his disasters, none
ever suggested following a different course in Croatia, Bosnia or
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a revolt from within the ranks of the security
forces either. The army may be seething but the real power in
Serbia is Milosevic's large, well-armed paramilitary police. This
is the regime's Preatorian guard and it will sink or swim with its
paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest threat to Milosevic comes from the unlikely
quarter of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to have crushed that nut when he had the chance. Now he
must endure Montenegro's youthful president, Milo Djukanovic,
lecturing him about how stupid he was to take on NATO in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic plays with the idea of taking Montenegro out of
Yugoslavia. But he may decide the stay, now the Serbs are humbled,
and angle for the post of Yugoslav president himself. &QL;

<P>
   No war is to be revelled in, but the one that at last seems to
be drawing to a close in Kosovo leaves an especially bitter taste.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, we have won, since it is our leaders and our generals
who are dictating terms to those of the vanquished Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But historians will long argue whether this war should ever have
been fought; whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic made it
inevitable, or whether more skillful diplomacy might have avoided a
conflict that has compounded the tragedy it was supposed to
prevent.
</P>
<P>
   And, we are entitled to ask, was it a ``war'' at all? In a war,
do not two sides engage each other in battle, and both sides suffer
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo 1999 will feature on no regimental roll of honor.
This was among the very few wars fought not in pursuit of national
interests but for reasons of simple humanity. However, there is no
sense of triumph, or of virtue rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been, had NATO suffered some casualties or had
Milosevic _ architect of a decade of misery in the Balkans _ been
overthrown. But he has not been, despite a one-sided contest in
which the Allies have not lost a single life in battle.
</P>
<P>
   This has been war by remote control, carried out by deadly
machines _ one without heroes, only victims: the million or more
ethnic Albanian refugees (now to be followed, surely, by tens of
thousands of ethnic Serb refugees) and the dead and maimed
civilians who constitute the ``collateral damage'' of errant NATO
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wicked things they have done, one can feel even a
shred of sympathy for the Serb commanders in the tent at Kumanovo,
obliged to surrender to an enemy they have barely seen, let alone
laid a glove on.
</P>
<P>
   All of which only reinforces our own obligation to spare no cost
or energy so that the refugees in whose name we fought this ``war''
can return home safely and in peace. &QL;

   SELENIUM-MUTATIONS (San Francisco) _ Kesterson National Wildlife

<P>
   ARMADILLO-MEAT (San Francisco) _ As it turns out, armadillo meat
isn't so bad for you after all _ unless you eat it raw. San
Francisco Health Department officials told members of the Animal
Control and Welfare Commission that any risk of contracting leprosy
from armadillos would be nil as long as the animals were either
frozen or cooked. By RAY DELGADO.

   COUNSELING-HOMELESS (Houston) _ The Baylor/Star of Hope Family
Counseling Center is one of only a handful in the country that
offers intensive, individual and group counseling, psychological
testing and evaluations to the homeless. The program is helping an
abused woman understand the anger she's now free to feel. By
JANETTE RODRIGUES. (Filed Wendesday for release Sunday, June 13.

<P>
   LIVERMORE-LAYOFFS (San Francisco) _ Major layoffs may be ahead
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the nuclear weapons lab
east of San Francisco, as it ends a 26-year effort to use lasers to
develop nuclear fuel. The layoffs might affect as many as 500
employees of the lab and its contractors, lab officials announced.

   TEXAS-DROUGHT (San Antonio) _ Officials are urging people to
conserve water as lack of rain and heavy demand are causing Edwards
Aquifer levels to plunge almost a foot a day with the region in a
moderate drought. If the drought management plan is triggered this
summer, it would be the third time in four years. By JERRY NEEDHAM.

   PANAMA-CANAL (Aboard the Konkar Star, Panama) _ Here on the
Panama Canal, Robert Holden is part autocrat, part artist. His curt
instructions set off a chain reaction of bustle and fuss by the
captain and crew of a ship he is piloting through the waterway. We
look at Holden's life and work, both of which are fast disappearing
as Washington prepares to surrender one of the key engineering
marvels of the American Century _ the Panama Canal. By JOHN OTIS.

   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ If you believe the conventional
wisdom, then the office suite war _ like the operating system war
and the browser war _ is over, and Microsoft has won. But a funny
thing happened while Bill Gates &AMP; Co. were celebrating another
victory. Corel Corp. has just released the slickest version yet of
its office suite. WordPerfect Office 2000 Professional nearly
matches Microsoft's latest entry, Office 2000, feature for feature,

   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``When I send
e-mail to someone on America Online, they tell me they get strange
markings and the sentences are broken up. `BSP' is at the end of

sending e-mail to someone on AOL? I use Netscape Communicator as my

   FILM-REVIEW-SHAGGED (Undated) _ An ``Austin Powers'' sequel
didn't have to be good. It could have let its hype do all its work
like that other sequel. It could've coasted on and basked in its
cultural-sleeper-phenomenon status. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BESIEGED (Undated) _ Told with the distorted
ambiguity and hypnotic poetry of a dream, ``Besieged'' is a jolt of
restless sleeping. But who's dreaming here? Is it the African woman
(Thandie Newton) and British man (David Thewlis) forced into a
tryst in order to make smooth beauty out of a sexual pairing of the
Third World and Imperialist England? Or is it Bernardo Bertolucci,
who's directing with a scaled-down litheness he rarely displays? By
WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-ALONE (Undated) _ ``I Stand Alone'' has the ghastly
stink of a rotting corpse. You can smell the cess as clearly as you
can see the blood vessels striking like lightning around the pupils
of its malefactor's eyes. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-CHIAPAS (Undated) _ Too sophisticated to be simply
wide-eyed, not nosy enough to be deeply probing, Nettie Wild's ``A
Place Called Chiapas'' makes a virtue of its filmmaker's innocence
as she slyly, almost manipulatively, ingratiates herself to the
major players in the notorious, ongoing Zapatista insurgence that
broke out in 1994 in southern Mexico. By WESLEY MORRIS.

 &HT;    Political analysis at home
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ I was at my end of the breakfast table
with the morning paper, trying to catch up on whose embassy and
what hospital had been bombed in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how people change,'' I remarked. ``Bill Clinton
certainly has done a 180.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's changed all that much,'' my wife objected.
``The only difference I can see is that, while he was a womanizer
in Arkansas, he's been more of a girlizer in Washington. Monica
Lewinsky is a lot younger than Gennifer Flowers and Paula Jones and
some of the others we know about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about his sex life,'' I explained. ``What
puzzles me is how he switched from being a Vietnam draft dodger and
war protester into a president who drops bombs and shoots missiles
all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because he's really an actor,'' she said. ``He
probably thinks he's George C. Scott playing General Patton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he'd rather go down in history as Bomber Bill than a
near child molester,'' I said. ``I just wish he'd be more like
Teddy Roosevelt. Ol' TR went straight up San Juan Hill with his
troops. Clinton could at least ride along on one of his Stealth
bomber missions. It would make a great photo op, and he'd be safer
than being home in bed with Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have guns we wouldn't have all these people being
killed,'' my wife protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be right,'' I admitted, ``but there are constitutional
issues about individual rights to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do dogs have constitutional rights?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' I admitted. ``I wouldn't think so, but trees
and snail darters seem to, so I guess it's possible. Why are you
asking about dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you read the story about the Fayette County
Commission?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I answered. ``What have they done now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made it illegal to have more than three dogs. The
story says one lady is eight dogs over the limit. She hired a
lawyer to try to keep her dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what happens if you have more than three dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you go to jail, unless you open a kennel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you open a kennel?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says here you have to have runs and shelters and be at
least 300 feet from neighboring residential property.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing Lassie didn't come from a big family and
live in Fayette County,'' I said. ``She'd have ended up in the
pound instead of in the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a good law to me,'' she said. ``We shouldn't be
feeding so many dogs when children in Africa are starving to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good point,'' I admitted, ``but it sounds
unconstitutional. What if the commissioners decide we can have only
two dogs, or one dog, or no dogs? How about parakeets and goldfish?
There are some things the government just shouldn't control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it happens,'' she said. ``Don't you remember when we
were in China last year? The government won't let Chinese couples
have more than one child, unless they're farmers and need the
help.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I agreed. ``But China is a communist dictatorship.
We're supposed to be a democracy. Besides, the Fayette County dog
law is obviously prejudicial, unfair, and discriminatory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you mean?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about cats? People can have as many cats as they want,
but only three dogs. That's discrimination if I ever heard of it.
It's ridiculous! Everybody knows a dog is man's best friend. Cats
hold humans in contempt, show no gratitude, don't recognize their
own names, bite and scratch benefactors, and sometimes smother
newborn babies. If we're going to have a limit on dogs we darn sure
need a limit on cats!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the commissioners will make up some new laws about
cats,'' she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out that every time politicians and bureaucrats make
up new laws we lose individual rights. In Fayette County I don't
think you can build a birdhouse without several complicated
permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's strange,'' she said. ``Aren't all the people in charge
Republicans? And don't Republicans stand for individual rights?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not any more,'' I said. ``Barry Goldwater's dead. Everybody
has switched roles. Bill Clinton acts like Teddy Roosevelt and
Republicans love Big Government as much as the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then maybe when they finish with dogs they'll do something
about cars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do what about cars?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you read the newspapers?'' she said. ``We've got so many
cars nobody can get anywhere on time and we can't breathe because
of the pollution. Why can't the commissioners make people cut down
on cars while they're getting rid of their dogs?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good idea,'' I agreed. ``Or, they could eliminate
drivers. Remember when we were in China they told us the government
makes people stop driving when they reach age 55?''
</P>
<P>
   ``China seems to have a lot of good ideas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.'' I agreed. ``And we've worked out a nice trade
arrangement. They steal our military secrets and we steal their
rules.''

 &HT;    Jointer vs. planer debate continues
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some folks feel they don't need a jointer if they have
a planer. I think they're wrong, and it was gratifying to encounter
this thread on the rec.woodworking newsgroup on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a question:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting close to buying a jointer for my home workshop and
I need some advice. From a functional point of view how much more
useful is an 8-inch jointer than a 6-inch? I know that the 8-inch
usually has a longer bed and more horsepower, but for someone who
will be making cabinets from solid wood is there a significant
difference?''
</P>
<P>
   I'll inject part of an answer here: Someone making cabinets from
solid wood has the greatest need of all for a wide planer. Now,
I'll step aside and report what the folks in the news group told
him:
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself in the same dilemma two weeks ago. I got the
8-inch jointer for one reason: I just couldn't afford a 12-inch,''
said the first responder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought an 8-inch WoodTek last year,'' said the next reply.
``For the money, it can't be beat. The extra power is very
noticeable when you need to get through some seriously hard
maple.''
</P>
<P>
   Then another novice weighs in with a related question :
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the advice to go with 8-inch to handle wider boards still
apply if you are planing on a planer also?''
</P>
<P>
   A response, and I couldn't have put it better myself:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because a jointer and a planer are extremely
complimentary tools. I use the jointer on every rough board I
plane, to give it one smooth or ``plane'' side. Plane it with a
jointed side down, and you won't believe the accurately milled
board you get.''

   CHICKENPOX _ ATLANTA _ It used to be that Dr. Karen Dewling had
to persuade parents to give the chickenpox vaccine a try. But in
the past six months, she's seen a dramatic turn-around, with moms
and dads asking for the shots for their kids. ``People have really
caught on to the fact that this is a good disease to prevent,''
said Dewling, a pediatrician at the Emory Clinic North in Duluth.
``A lot more parents are getting the message.'' To make sure the

the tamoxifen they were giving me for chemotherapy.' But then she
discovered a fitness program specifically for breast cancer

   INFANT-BEDSHARING _ DAYTON, Ohio _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The baby
triplets clearly don't like being apart. When one of them is left
alone in the bed they all share, it won't be long before she'll
start moving around and fussing. She seems to be reaching out for
her sisters. ``They always have to be touching each other, and
they'll smile,'' says their mother, April Lenz. ``When you look at
them together, you can just see the peace that they have.'' The
limited research on premature babies who share a bed with their
siblings suggests it's more than just comforting to stay close with
their buddies from the womb as soon as practical after birth. They
also gain weight faster, begin maintaining body heat earlier and
nurse sooner on more nutritious breast milk, says Linda Lutes, an
infant-development specialist and the country's foremost advocate
of what she calls co-bedding. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). MOVED

clearly anytime _ comes close to fantasy. It's something they try

   CHICKENPOX _ ATLANTA _ It used to be that Dr. Karen Dewling had
to persuade parents to give the chickenpox vaccine a try. But in
the past six months, she's seen a dramatic turn-around, with moms
and dads asking for the shots for their kids. ``People have really
caught on to the fact that this is a good disease to prevent,''
said Dewling, a pediatrician at the Emory Clinic North in Duluth.
``A lot more parents are getting the message.'' To make sure the
trend continues, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
advisoroy committee has just issued new recommendations about the
chickenpox vaccine. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15. FOR

   CANCER-REHAB _ SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ Janet Gray remembers what her
life was like after she was diagnosed with breast cancer. ``My life
was going down the tubes fast,'' the 50-year-old Springfield
resident said. ``I was tired all the time. I gained 90 pounds on
the tamoxifen they were giving me for chemotherapy.' But then she
discovered a fitness program specifically for breast cancer
survivors run by the Ohio State University Center for Wellness and
Prevention, The James Cancer Center, and Community Hospital. Gray,
a bus driver for the Clark-Shawnee District, attends the fitness
program twice a week at the Community Hospital Center for Coronary
Prevention and Rehabilitation. (Springfield News-Sun). 15. FOR

   INFANT-BEDSHARING _ DAYTON, Ohio _ DAYTON, Ohio _ The baby
triplets clearly don't like being apart. When one of them is left
alone in the bed they all share, it won't be long before she'll
start moving around and fussing. She seems to be reaching out for
her sisters. ``They always have to be touching each other, and
they'll smile,'' says their mother, April Lenz. ``When you look at
them together, you can just see the peace that they have.'' The
limited research on premature babies who share a bed with their
siblings suggests it's more than just comforting to stay close with
their buddies from the womb as soon as practical after birth. They
also gain weight faster, begin maintaining body heat earlier and
nurse sooner on more nutritious breast milk, says Linda Lutes, an
infant-development specialist and the country's foremost advocate
of what she calls co-bedding. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News). MOVED

clearly anytime _ comes close to fantasy. It's something they try
to imagine but can't quite visualize. (Scott, Austin

 &HT;    Jointer vs. planer debate continues
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some folks feel they don't need a jointer if they have
a planer. I think they're wrong, and it was gratifying to encounter
this thread on the rec.woodworking newsgroup on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a question:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting close to buying a jointer for my home workshop and
I need some advice. From a functional point of view how much more
useful is an 8-inch jointer than a 6-inch? I know that the 8-inch
usually has a longer bed and more horsepower, but for someone who
will be making cabinets from solid wood is there a significant
difference?''
</P>
<P>
   I'll inject part of an answer here: Someone making cabinets from
solid wood has the greatest need of all for a wide planer. Now,
I'll step aside and report what the folks in the news group told
him:
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself in the same dilemma two weeks ago. I got the
8-inch jointer for one reason: I just couldn't afford a 12-inch,''
said the first responder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought an 8-inch WoodTek last year,'' said the next reply.
``For the money, it can't be beat. The extra power is very
noticeable when you need to get through some seriously hard
maple.''
</P>
<P>
   Then another novice weighs in with a related question :
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the advice to go with 8-inch to handle wider boards still
apply if you are planing on a planer also?''
</P>
<P>
   A response, and I couldn't have put it better myself:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because a jointer and a planer are extremely
complimentary tools. I use the jointer on every rough board I
plane, to give it one smooth or ``plane'' side. Plane it with a
jointed side down, and you won't believe the accurately milled
board you get.''

</P>
<P>
   Round-trip motorcoach tours to fun destinations give mature
travelers the opportunity to visit nearby gaming areas for a day or
two at almost no expense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Las Vegas or Laughlin, Nev., such motorcoach
tours, which are also called ``turn-arounds,'' arrive almost daily
from Arizona and California, while buses to Reno, Nev., come from
San Francisco and other Bay Area locations.
</P>
<P>
   Ludmilla Alexander of Saratoga, Calif., joined Matty Bagano of
Nutley, N.J., and Diane Bocchino of Hawthorne, N.J., on a Leisure
Line motorcoach (800-522-4187) heading to Atlantic City. Their
goal: Gamble a little, eat lunch, stroll along the Boardwalk and
watch the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Bugano, 81, says she takes the motorcoach for little getaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm retired and live with my daughter, so this gives me an
opportunity to see people and do something exciting,'' she says.
``It's not expensive at all. You pay $23 for the round-trip bus
from Nutley, then get back $16 in silver half-dollars at Trump
World's Fair Casino. I also look in the newspapers for coupons on
food and attractions. One time, I collected so many coupons, the
entire trip cost me $2.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocchino, who is in her mid-50s, echoes Bagano's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take care of an ailing mother and need to get a break
occasionally,'' she says. ``Twice a week, I take the bus to
Atlantic City to swim in the ocean and lie on the beach. It's very
relaxing, and you meet wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour trip from northern New Jersey, bus
passengers compare coupons they have clipped that week from
newspapers. Once in Atlantic City, they get off at their favorite
casino and head for cashier windows to claim their coins.
</P>
<P>
   Some use the money to buy themselves lunch, while others head
for their ``lucky'' slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander says Atlantic City, whose fame started in the first
half of this century, is experiencing a rebirth, thanks, in part,
to mature travelers arriving by the busloads.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, she says, tend to favor Mondays through Thursdays
because of fewer crowds and lower accommodation prices should they
decide to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is the key to Atlantic City's success: Bally's,
Caesars, Trump and Tropicana are just a few of the gaming
corporations that line the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wynn, who built the highly successful Mirage Resorts Inc.,
Treasure Island and Bellagio properties in Las Vegas, is planning a
new casino resort, tentatively called Le Jardin, that will be up
and running by mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaming has formed a joint-venture with Mirage to build The
Borgata, a resort-casino with an Italian-village theme. It is
expected to open in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantic City differs from Las Vegas in that Atlantic City has
a beachfront location and a well-preserved history,'' Alexander
says. ``The resort was built in the 1880s to attract working- and
middle-class Americans who could finally afford to travel because
of mass transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alexander says, ``Atlantic City is wonderful to visit,
whether gambling is for you or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For nostalgia buffs, the Atlantic City Historical Museum
(609-347-5839; free) on the old Garden Pier _ where silent-film
star Rudolph Valentino once taught dancing _ is a must-see
attraction. It has many displays from Atlantic City's early days,
like the origin of the Heinz 57 pickle pin and the history of the
Monopoly game. (All locations on the Monopoly board are named after
Atlantic City streets.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Chairs (609-347-7148), which became popular near the
turn of the century, are still pushed along the Boardwalk by hardy
walkers, many of whom are international students. Fees start at $5
for a push up to six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For Alexander, the experience is unlike any other. ``It's so
nice to roll along in the wicker chairs past the various souvenir
shops, arcades and food stalls which sell everything from Italian
hoagies to funnel cakes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Miss America Pageant, held annually on the second weekend
after Labor Day, welcomes the public to many activities, including
the preliminaries, the pageant itself, and the Boardwalk parade.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday night parade, Alexander says, ``is great fun for
onlookers as they shout `show us your shoes' to contestants, who
ride by in convertibles. The women smile, wave and ... display wild
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition started in the early days when tired contestants
with sore feet used the opportunity to get out of their tall heels
and into comfy bedroom slippers. Now, decorations on their shoes
represent each contestant's state and can include sunglasses,
flowers and leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, some pageant memorabilia can be seen at the
Sheraton Hotel across the street from the Convention Center, where
displays of gowns worn by various Miss Americas over the years are
showcased in the lobby, as well as the Waterford crystal crown and
scepter the winner receives.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel is a statue of Bert Parks, longtime emcee for
the pageant. He holds a replica of the prized possession in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can resist standing underneath the crown to be Miss
America for a quick photo?'' Alexander asks.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts for mature travelers are posted at Ripley's Believe It
or Not! Museum (on the Boardwalk at New York Avenue, 609-347-2001),
where seniors ages 60 and older pay $6.95 vs. $8.95 for other
adults, and Atlantic City Cruises (609-347-7600) that leave from
Gardner's Basin. Discounts range from $5 to $10 off various
cruises.
</P>
<P>

extras. Here is a sampling:

   _ Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort (800-257-8677) has a

 &UR; FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It can be slow getting through Houston traffic to the Bayou Bend
Collection and Gardens. But in a way, that only increases the
pleasure of arriving at the home of the city's celebrated
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Westcott Street, a short drive west of town that
leads from Memorial Drive to the estate's parking lot, is a small
suspension footbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a warm day this spring it felt at least 10 degrees
cooler on the bridge as the wind rippled through the trees that
encircle the home built for Ima Hogg and two of her brothers in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Although her name tends to bring a smirk when heard for the
first time, her achievement is no laughing matter. Daughter of
James Stephen Hogg, Texas' first native-born Governor and a member
of a prominent Texas family, Miss Hogg _ who died in 1975 at the
age of 93 _ put 55 years into building a collection of American art
and antiques that spans two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, she intended to collect furniture to give to a
museum in Texas, which was rather farsighted because when she
started collecting, there wasn't a museum in Texas,'' said David B.
Warren, director of Bayou Bend, which Miss Hogg deeded to the
city's Museum of Fine Arts in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   She explained her goal saying, ``I hope in a modest way Bayou
Bend may serve as a bridge to bring us closer to the heart of an
American heritage which unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Miss Hogg was modest in her hopes, she was not in her
collecting (more than 4,800 American decorative items) or her home,
a pink (she loved pink) stucco mansion, one of the first to be
built in River Oaks, Houston's premier neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The house, surrounded by 14 acres of woods, lawns and gardens,
evokes the homes of the Old South. She referred to the architecture
as Latin Colonial, a style that recalled Louisiana and the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed in 1927 by the well-known Houston architect John F.
Staub, it gets its name from Buffalo Bayou, which winds around
three sides of the property.
</P>
<P>
   While she filled her home with a vast collection of American
antiques, Miss Hogg surrounded it with eight distinctive gardens,
several of which feature an astonishing array of pink azaleas and
camellias.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most striking are the formal Clio Garden, named for
the statue of the muse of History that sits at its center, and the
newly rehabilitated Diana Garden, a formal garden of azaleas,
magnolias and hedges dominated by a statue of Diana, which provides
an impressive backdrop looking from the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Others range from the white garden, planted in deep ravines that
cut through the estate, to the butterfly garden, named for its
shape and planted with vintage camellias and azaleas, to a topiary
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth a visit to Bayou Bend simply to stroll through the
grounds. People with small children may have to do just that since
those under the age of 10 are not admitted on the house tours,
which are limited to six.
</P>
<P>
   Led by well-informed docents, the tours take visitors through
the two floors of the house into 28 separate areas dedicated to
tracing the evolution of style in America from Colonial days to the
Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   Each docent, a museum-trained volunteer, provides an individual
touch, going beyond telling visitors what they're looking at, to
discuss how history influenced the furnishings and decorative arts
from each period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pine Room, a paneled former library with a bay
window, fireplace and two John Smibert portraits, is described as
typifying the Baroque period; a variety of chairs in the room _
William and Mary to Queen Anne _ are used to trace an emerging
Asian influence on furnishing styles.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the change, visitors learn, is that when Charles
II became King of England, he married a Portuguese princess, which
opened doors to trade in Asia. (Much of American furniture at this
time was still heavily influenced by English styles.)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hogg started her collection with a simple maple chair made
in New England in the mid-1700's, purchased in 1920 from Collings &AMP;
Collings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the museum are a Queen Anne japanned
high chest, circa 1730-1760, one of a handful existing today; a
Newport block front desk and bookcase, one of 11 existing, and the
only John Henry Belter parlor set _ a highly ornate Rococo Revival
suite of two armchairs, two side chairs and a sofa in laminated and
carved rosewood _ with an original bill of sale.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fun to look at some of the more whimsical items, such
as Staffordshire transferware plates commemorating various
historical events, or a 1758 blue and white delft English ceramic
punch bowl with the words ``Fill the Other Bowl Boys'' painted in
underglaze blue on the inside bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, which depends primarily on donations for
acquisitions, continues to add to the collection, this year
purchasing a pre-Revolutionary Charleston great chair, the earliest
piece of Charleston furniture known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent purchase is a Chinese porcelain stand, such as a
gravy boat might be set on, from George Washington's personal china
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't under the bell jar,'' Mr. Warren said of the
collection, ``so it definitely continues to grow and improve.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does the Museum of Fine Arts continue to expand its
decorative arts collection. On May 1, the museum opened Rienzi to
the public. This River Oaks estate features 18th-and 19th-century
European furniture, paintings, precious metals and objets d'art. It
is just minutes from Bayou Bend.
</P>
<P>
   House tours, gardens, plus a detour worth a stop
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, at 1 Westcott, (713) 639-7750, is 10 to 15 minutes
from downtown Houston. There is a story with every room, and guided
tours are offered Tuesday through Friday; hours vary. It's best to
call for reservations (a week or two in advance during the school
year).
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, there are self-guided audio tours only, also open
to children, from 1 to 5 p.m. (third Sunday of the month free,
unless special events are scheduled); only audio tours offered in
August. Admission: $10 for tours of the house and gardens; $5 for
ages 10 to 18; under 10, free; $3 for the gardens only.
</P>
<P>
   Rienzi, with its fine collection of 18th- and 19th-century
European decorative arts, is less than a mile from Bayou Bend, at
1406 Kirby Drive. Open Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sundays 1 to 5 p.m.; guided tours only (by
reservation). Admission $6; children allowed Sunday only.
Reservations: (713) 639-7800.

   &UR; By ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip motorcoach tours to fun destinations give mature
travelers the opportunity to visit nearby gaming areas for a day or
two at almost no expense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Las Vegas or Laughlin, Nev., such motorcoach
tours, which are also called ``turn-arounds,'' arrive almost daily
from Arizona and California, while buses to Reno, Nev., come from
San Francisco and other Bay Area locations.
</P>
<P>
   Ludmilla Alexander of Saratoga, Calif., joined Matty Bagano of
Nutley, N.J., and Diane Bocchino of Hawthorne, N.J., on a Leisure
Line motorcoach (800-522-4187) heading to Atlantic City. Their
goal: Gamble a little, eat lunch, stroll along the Boardwalk and
watch the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Bugano, 81, says she takes the motorcoach for little getaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm retired and live with my daughter, so this gives me an
opportunity to see people and do something exciting,'' she says.
``It's not expensive at all. You pay $23 for the round-trip bus
from Nutley, then get back $16 in silver half-dollars at Trump
World's Fair Casino. I also look in the newspapers for coupons on
food and attractions. One time, I collected so many coupons, the
entire trip cost me $2.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocchino, who is in her mid-50s, echoes Bagano's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take care of an ailing mother and need to get a break
occasionally,'' she says. ``Twice a week, I take the bus to
Atlantic City to swim in the ocean and lie on the beach. It's very
relaxing, and you meet wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour trip from northern New Jersey, bus
passengers compare coupons they have clipped that week from
newspapers. Once in Atlantic City, they get off at their favorite
casino and head for cashier windows to claim their coins.
</P>
<P>
   Some use the money to buy themselves lunch, while others head
for their ``lucky'' slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander says Atlantic City, whose fame started in the first
half of this century, is experiencing a rebirth, thanks, in part,
to mature travelers arriving by the busloads.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, she says, tend to favor Mondays through Thursdays
because of fewer crowds and lower accommodation prices should they
decide to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is the key to Atlantic City's success: Bally's,
Caesars, Trump and Tropicana are just a few of the gaming
corporations that line the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wynn, who built the highly successful Mirage Resorts Inc.,
Treasure Island and Bellagio properties in Las Vegas, is planning a
new casino resort, tentatively called Le Jardin, that will be up
and running by mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaming has formed a joint-venture with Mirage to build The
Borgata, a resort-casino with an Italian-village theme. It is
expected to open in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantic City differs from Las Vegas in that Atlantic City has
a beachfront location and a well-preserved history,'' Alexander
says. ``The resort was built in the 1880s to attract working- and
middle-class Americans who could finally afford to travel because
of mass transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alexander says, ``Atlantic City is wonderful to visit,
whether gambling is for you or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For nostalgia buffs, the Atlantic City Historical Museum
(609-347-5839; free) on the old Garden Pier _ where silent-film
star Rudolph Valentino once taught dancing _ is a must-see
attraction. It has many displays from Atlantic City's early days,
like the origin of the Heinz 57 pickle pin and the history of the
Monopoly game. (All locations on the Monopoly board are named after
Atlantic City streets.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Chairs (609-347-7148), which became popular near the
turn of the century, are still pushed along the Boardwalk by hardy
walkers, many of whom are international students. Fees start at $5
for a push up to six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For Alexander, the experience is unlike any other. ``It's so
nice to roll along in the wicker chairs past the various souvenir
shops, arcades and food stalls which sell everything from Italian
hoagies to funnel cakes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Miss America Pageant, held annually on the second weekend
after Labor Day, welcomes the public to many activities, including
the preliminaries, the pageant itself, and the Boardwalk parade.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday night parade, Alexander says, ``is great fun for
onlookers as they shout `show us your shoes' to contestants, who
ride by in convertibles. The women smile, wave and ... display wild
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition started in the early days when tired contestants
with sore feet used the opportunity to get out of their tall heels
and into comfy bedroom slippers. Now, decorations on their shoes
represent each contestant's state and can include sunglasses,
flowers and leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, some pageant memorabilia can be seen at the
Sheraton Hotel across the street from the Convention Center, where
displays of gowns worn by various Miss Americas over the years are
showcased in the lobby, as well as the Waterford crystal crown and
scepter the winner receives.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel is a statue of Bert Parks, longtime emcee for
the pageant. He holds a replica of the prized possession in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can resist standing underneath the crown to be Miss
America for a quick photo?'' Alexander asks.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts for mature travelers are posted at Ripley's Believe It
or Not! Museum (on the Boardwalk at New York Avenue, 609-347-2001),
where seniors ages 60 and older pay $6.95 vs. $8.95 for other
adults, and Atlantic City Cruises (609-347-7600) that leave from
Gardner's Basin. Discounts range from $5 to $10 off various
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   While lodging is not discounted specifically for seniors, summer
is prime time for hotels to offer lodging packages filled with
extras. Here is a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort (800-257-8677) has a
Celebrate Summer package, available June 27 to Sept. 23, with room

   &UR; By ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip motorcoach tours to fun destinations give mature
travelers the opportunity to visit nearby gaming areas for a day or
two at almost no expense.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Las Vegas or Laughlin, Nev., such motorcoach
tours, which are also called ``turn-arounds,'' arrive almost daily
from Arizona and California, while buses to Reno, Nev., come from
San Francisco and other Bay Area locations.
</P>
<P>
   Ludmilla Alexander of Saratoga, Calif., joined Matty Bagano of
Nutley, N.J., and Diane Bocchino of Hawthorne, N.J., on a Leisure
Line motorcoach (800-522-4187) heading to Atlantic City. Their
goal: Gamble a little, eat lunch, stroll along the Boardwalk and
watch the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Bugano, 81, says she takes the motorcoach for little getaways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm retired and live with my daughter, so this gives me an
opportunity to see people and do something exciting,'' she says.
``It's not expensive at all. You pay $23 for the round-trip bus
from Nutley, then get back $16 in silver half-dollars at Trump
World's Fair Casino. I also look in the newspapers for coupons on
food and attractions. One time, I collected so many coupons, the
entire trip cost me $2.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocchino, who is in her mid-50s, echoes Bagano's sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take care of an ailing mother and need to get a break
occasionally,'' she says. ``Twice a week, I take the bus to
Atlantic City to swim in the ocean and lie on the beach. It's very
relaxing, and you meet wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour trip from northern New Jersey, bus
passengers compare coupons they have clipped that week from
newspapers. Once in Atlantic City, they get off at their favorite
casino and head for cashier windows to claim their coins.
</P>
<P>
   Some use the money to buy themselves lunch, while others head
for their ``lucky'' slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander says Atlantic City, whose fame started in the first
half of this century, is experiencing a rebirth, thanks, in part,
to mature travelers arriving by the busloads.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors, she says, tend to favor Mondays through Thursdays
because of fewer crowds and lower accommodation prices should they
decide to spend the night.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is the key to Atlantic City's success: Bally's,
Caesars, Trump and Tropicana are just a few of the gaming
corporations that line the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wynn, who built the highly successful Mirage Resorts Inc.,
Treasure Island and Bellagio properties in Las Vegas, is planning a
new casino resort, tentatively called Le Jardin, that will be up
and running by mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaming has formed a joint-venture with Mirage to build The
Borgata, a resort-casino with an Italian-village theme. It is
expected to open in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlantic City differs from Las Vegas in that Atlantic City has
a beachfront location and a well-preserved history,'' Alexander
says. ``The resort was built in the 1880s to attract working- and
middle-class Americans who could finally afford to travel because
of mass transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Alexander says, ``Atlantic City is wonderful to visit,
whether gambling is for you or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For nostalgia buffs, the Atlantic City Historical Museum
(609-347-5839; free) on the old Garden Pier _ where silent-film
star Rudolph Valentino once taught dancing _ is a must-see
attraction. It has many displays from Atlantic City's early days,
like the origin of the Heinz 57 pickle pin and the history of the
Monopoly game. (All locations on the Monopoly board are named after
Atlantic City streets.)
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Chairs (609-347-7148), which became popular near the
turn of the century, are still pushed along the Boardwalk by hardy
walkers, many of whom are international students. Fees start at $5
for a push up to six blocks.
</P>
<P>
   For Alexander, the experience is unlike any other. ``It's so
nice to roll along in the wicker chairs past the various souvenir
shops, arcades and food stalls which sell everything from Italian
hoagies to funnel cakes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Miss America Pageant, held annually on the second weekend
after Labor Day, welcomes the public to many activities, including
the preliminaries, the pageant itself, and the Boardwalk parade.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday night parade, Alexander says, ``is great fun for
onlookers as they shout `show us your shoes' to contestants, who
ride by in convertibles. The women smile, wave and ... display wild
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition started in the early days when tired contestants
with sore feet used the opportunity to get out of their tall heels
and into comfy bedroom slippers. Now, decorations on their shoes
represent each contestant's state and can include sunglasses,
flowers and leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, some pageant memorabilia can be seen at the
Sheraton Hotel across the street from the Convention Center, where
displays of gowns worn by various Miss Americas over the years are
showcased in the lobby, as well as the Waterford crystal crown and
scepter the winner receives.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel is a statue of Bert Parks, longtime emcee for
the pageant. He holds a replica of the prized possession in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can resist standing underneath the crown to be Miss
America for a quick photo?'' Alexander asks.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts for mature travelers are posted at Ripley's Believe It
or Not! Museum (on the Boardwalk at New York Avenue, 609-347-2001),
where seniors ages 60 and older pay $6.95 vs. $8.95 for other
adults, and Atlantic City Cruises (609-347-7600) that leave from
Gardner's Basin. Discounts range from $5 to $10 off various
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   While lodging is not discounted specifically for seniors, summer

extras. Here is a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   _ Atlantic City Hilton Casino Resort (800-257-8677) has a

</P>
<P>
   It can be slow getting through Houston traffic to the Bayou Bend
Collection and Gardens. But in a way, that only increases the
pleasure of arriving at the home of the city's celebrated
philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Westcott Street, a short drive west of town that
leads from Memorial Drive to the estate's parking lot, is a small
suspension footbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a warm day this spring it felt at least 10 degrees
cooler on the bridge as the wind rippled through the trees that
encircle the home built for Ima Hogg and two of her brothers in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Although her name tends to bring a smirk when heard for the
first time, her achievement is no laughing matter. Daughter of
James Stephen Hogg, Texas' first native-born Governor and a member
of a prominent Texas family, Miss Hogg _ who died in 1975 at the
age of 93 _ put 55 years into building a collection of American art
and antiques that spans two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, she intended to collect furniture to give to a
museum in Texas, which was rather farsighted because when she
started collecting, there wasn't a museum in Texas,'' said David B.
Warren, director of Bayou Bend, which Miss Hogg deeded to the
city's Museum of Fine Arts in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   She explained her goal saying, ``I hope in a modest way Bayou
Bend may serve as a bridge to bring us closer to the heart of an
American heritage which unites us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Miss Hogg was modest in her hopes, she was not in her
collecting (more than 4,800 American decorative items) or her home,
a pink (she loved pink) stucco mansion, one of the first to be
built in River Oaks, Houston's premier neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The house, surrounded by 14 acres of woods, lawns and gardens,
evokes the homes of the Old South. She referred to the architecture
as Latin Colonial, a style that recalled Louisiana and the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Constructed in 1927 by the well-known Houston architect John F.
Staub, it gets its name from Buffalo Bayou, which winds around
three sides of the property.
</P>
<P>
   While she filled her home with a vast collection of American
antiques, Miss Hogg surrounded it with eight distinctive gardens,
several of which feature an astonishing array of pink azaleas and
camellias.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most striking are the formal Clio Garden, named for
the statue of the muse of History that sits at its center, and the
newly rehabilitated Diana Garden, a formal garden of azaleas,
magnolias and hedges dominated by a statue of Diana, which provides
an impressive backdrop looking from the back of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Others range from the white garden, planted in deep ravines that
cut through the estate, to the butterfly garden, named for its
shape and planted with vintage camellias and azaleas, to a topiary
garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth a visit to Bayou Bend simply to stroll through the
grounds. People with small children may have to do just that since
those under the age of 10 are not admitted on the house tours,
which are limited to six.
</P>
<P>
   Led by well-informed docents, the tours take visitors through
the two floors of the house into 28 separate areas dedicated to
tracing the evolution of style in America from Colonial days to the
Victorian era.
</P>
<P>
   Each docent, a museum-trained volunteer, provides an individual
touch, going beyond telling visitors what they're looking at, to
discuss how history influenced the furnishings and decorative arts
from each period.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Pine Room, a paneled former library with a bay
window, fireplace and two John Smibert portraits, is described as
typifying the Baroque period; a variety of chairs in the room _
William and Mary to Queen Anne _ are used to trace an emerging
Asian influence on furnishing styles.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the change, visitors learn, is that when Charles
II became King of England, he married a Portuguese princess, which
opened doors to trade in Asia. (Much of American furniture at this
time was still heavily influenced by English styles.)
</P>
<P>
   Miss Hogg started her collection with a simple maple chair made
in New England in the mid-1700's, purchased in 1920 from Collings &AMP;
Collings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the museum are a Queen Anne japanned
high chest, circa 1730-1760, one of a handful existing today; a
Newport block front desk and bookcase, one of 11 existing, and the
only John Henry Belter parlor set _ a highly ornate Rococo Revival
suite of two armchairs, two side chairs and a sofa in laminated and
carved rosewood _ with an original bill of sale.
</P>
<P>
   It is also fun to look at some of the more whimsical items, such
as Staffordshire transferware plates commemorating various
historical events, or a 1758 blue and white delft English ceramic
punch bowl with the words ``Fill the Other Bowl Boys'' painted in
underglaze blue on the inside bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, which depends primarily on donations for
acquisitions, continues to add to the collection, this year
purchasing a pre-Revolutionary Charleston great chair, the earliest
piece of Charleston furniture known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent purchase is a Chinese porcelain stand, such as a
gravy boat might be set on, from George Washington's personal china
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't under the bell jar,'' Mr. Warren said of the
collection, ``so it definitely continues to grow and improve.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, does the Museum of Fine Arts continue to expand its
decorative arts collection. On May 1, the museum opened Rienzi to
the public. This River Oaks estate features 18th-and 19th-century
European furniture, paintings, precious metals and objets d'art. It
is just minutes from Bayou Bend.
</P>
<P>
   House tours, gardens, plus a detour worth a stop
</P>
<P>
   Bayou Bend, at 1 Westcott, (713) 639-7750, is 10 to 15 minutes
from downtown Houston. There is a story with every room, and guided
tours are offered Tuesday through Friday; hours vary. It's best to
call for reservations (a week or two in advance during the school
year).
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, there are self-guided audio tours only, also open
to children, from 1 to 5 p.m. (third Sunday of the month free,
unless special events are scheduled); only audio tours offered in
August. Admission: $10 for tours of the house and gardens; $5 for
ages 10 to 18; under 10, free; $3 for the gardens only.
</P>
<P>
   Rienzi, with its fine collection of 18th- and 19th-century
European decorative arts, is less than a mile from Bayou Bend, at
1406 Kirby Drive. Open Monday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday from
10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sundays 1 to 5 p.m.; guided tours only (by
reservation). Admission $6; children allowed Sunday only.
Reservations: (713) 639-7800.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: From reading your columns, it seems you favor
Windows 98 over 95. My local ``experts'' don't recommend using 98
yet. What advantages does it have?
</P>
<P>
   _Windows Watcher
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WATCHER: What advantages? Are you kidding? Don't you know
that 98 is at least three better than 95? That's why I can hardly
wait for Windows 2000, which promises to be at least five better.
</P>
<P>
   Tell your ``experts'' to pull their heads out of their
respective sandboxes. Their attitude might have been justified the
first couple of months Windows 98 was on the shelves, but it's
downright silly now that it has proved itself a big improvement
over 95. These people became ``experts'' because they got really
comfortable with 95. Giving up 95 for a new operating system
threatens that specious expertise. They probably had trouble giving
up their baby blankies, too.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't even a new operating system. Win98 is just a
gussied-up Windows 95, minus a couple of thousand bugs. It's got
support for all sorts of new hardware, and it's chock-full of new
features and utilities, including stuff that repairs system errors
that would have been fatal to 95.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that 98 is bug-free or that your life
will be endlessly better because you upgraded or even that I've
sold out to Microsoft. The check wasn't big enough.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I bought an iMac even though I have no real
reason for a computer. I believed the Internet hype.

<P>
   DEAR SAUCED: My editors are asking readers to please refrain
from providing me with such obvious straight lines. They are tired
of the ceaseless death threats we all receive here every time I say
something nasty like, ``But you didn't buy a computer. You bought
an iMac.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually iMacs, despite their unfortunate color schemes, are
fine machines, perfectly suited for Net surfing, gaming and most of
the stuff home users say they want to do. I hope you didn't really
believe their commercials about how easy they are to hook up to the
Internet, though.
</P>
<P>
   The ad agency sort of left out the part about establishing an
account with an Internet service provider and getting all those
software and modem settings right. It doesn't matter whether you
have a PC or a Mac, that stuff is confusing. A computer isn't a
toaster oven. You can't just turn it on and have everything working
without investing a little brainpower, although the suit that hired
Jeff Goldblum as a spokesman exhibited none of that. I bet he burns
his toast, too.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You lost me! I've given up reading your column.
It disgusts me! Your sexist remarks and ``humor'' must be written
by and for the 15-24 age group.

   DEAR AP: I wish! The demographics dweezils have been after me
for years to go after that market since the only ads they've been
able to sell anywhere near my column have been for laxatives and
trusses.

you. I'm only 16, but I relate with your attitude.

   The bathroom was found to be the most dangerous room. Two or
more hazards were found in 59 percent of bathrooms. More than 60
percent lacked grab bars in the tub or shower, about the only
hazard that was not found in housing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Other common hazards included loose mats, slippery tubs and
showers lacking nonskid mats or abrasive strips, poor lighting and
toilets that were wobbly or too low to allow older people to rise
from them safely. The living room was second most dangerous, with
42 percent having two or more hazards, mostly trip hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchens came next, with 40 percent having two or more hazards.
Light switches were hard to find in more than two-thirds of
kitchens, especially in the dark, and trip hazards were found on
nearly a third of kitchen floors.
</P>
<P>
   Other kitchen hazards included unstable step stools, poor
lighting and storage of frequently used objects in places that
required reaching up or bending over. Living rooms were next with
dim lighting, shadows or glare and chairs that were too low to get
out of easily, along with many floor hazards.

<P>
   Sixty percent of falls occur at home, and about a quarter of all
falls result from hazards like slippery or wet surfaces, poor
lighting, inadequate footwear and cluttered pathways in a home. To
help avoid these kinds of falls, Dr. Mary Tinette, director of
Yale's Program on Aging, suggests two proven measures.
</P>
<P>
   One involves exercises that increase physical strength and
balance. Strength training, like lifts with hand and leg weights,
has grown in popularity among older people. These exercises have
two benefits: they increase people's physical strength, thus
decreasing their chances of falling, and they increase bone mass so
that if a fall should occur, the risk of fracture is reduced.
Muscle strength is important to nearly every activity of daily
living, from getting out of the bed to climbing stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Tai chi has been demonstrated by osteoporosis researchers at the
Hospital for Special Surgery in New York to improve balance and
decrease the risk of falls in older people.
</P>
<P>
   Another important measure for maintaining balance is avoiding
side effects like dizziness and vision impairment caused by
medications. Those most at risk of falls take four or more
medications. Certain drugs, for example some drugs used to treat
high blood pressure or heart ailments, can cause dizziness, central
nervous system depression and movement disorders that increase the
risk of falls.
</P>
<P>
   Tinette suggests that people discuss with their physicians the
possibility of reducing the number of drugs taken and keeping
dosages to the minimum necessary to control the ailment. Effective
alternative medications can sometimes be prescribed to avoid the
side effects that make falls more likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish researchers also attributed the increase in falls
among the older people to an increase in alcohol consumption and
the use of psychotropic drugs. Older people are more susceptible to
the adverse effects of mind-altering chemicals; an amount of
alcohol that was handled well at 40 may become a serious hazard at
60.
</P>
<P>
   The fall-prevention program of the American Academy of
Orthopaedic Surgeons suggests a number of ways to help the elderly
stay on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install sturdy hand rails on all stairways and grab bars in
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover stairs with tightly woven carpet or nonslip treads.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid climbing and reaching up to high shelves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a step stool with handrails
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not wax floors and always clean up spills as soon as they
happen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wear low-heeled shoes with nonskid soles. Avoid thick, heavy
soles and keep laces tied so that the shoes fit snugly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try not to use a bed that is too high, and before getting out
of bed, sit on the edge for a few minutes to be sure you are not
dizzy.

CLINTON, CLINTON, BUSH, BUSH AND TORME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: Do you suppose that the president's claims of
victory in his Yugoslav military adventure will hold up under the
scrutiny of history? For that matter, do you suppose they'll hold
up for the 11 days that NATO has given the Serbs to clear out of
Kosovo?
</P>
<P>
   There are those who suspect that Clinton went to war only for
the purpose of securing some sort of meaningful legacy for his
controversial presidency. Nothing is beneath this guy, but my guess
is that he intervened in Kosovo because he truly believed it was
the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, lots of us who believe that involving the
United States in a centuries-old ethnic conflict in Europe was the
wrong thing to do, no matter what the outcome. Right or wrong, the
United States is committed for the long haul _ which means that
questions about rightness or wrongness must be answered with that
always reliable cliche: Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Where do these people get their nerve?
Many Americans are counting the days until January 2001, when the
Clintons are required by law to vacate the White House. But the
first lady refuses to go away, gearing up instead for a U.S. Senate
race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   If she's seeking redemption by undertaking a political career of
her own, her efforts could turn out to be self-defeating. Her
opponent and the contentious New York media surely won't let her
stroll through a Senate campaign without reliving the various
Clinton scandals _ including a few in which she was a knee-deep
participant.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't Hillary do what's best for the country by taking a few
years off before jumping into the political fray? Must be because
the country always takes a back seat to the Clintons' ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE BUSH: The former president will be 75 years old Saturday,
and he's still jumping out of airplanes. If I'd known he had so
much fuel left in those Ivy League engines, I wouldn't have spent
so much time worrying about the hapless Dan Quayle being a
heartbeat away from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE W. BUSH: While his dad was skydiving over College
Station, the Texas governor was getting ready to leap into the
treacherous crosswinds of the 2000 presidential campaign. The
all-but-declared candidate will be ``testing the waters'' of
national politics in the coming days and weeks in hopes of finding
out if voters are as enthused about his White House prospects as
pollsters are.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that once the just-plain-folks in remote locales
such as New Hampshire, Iowa and California get a close-up look at
Bush the Younger, his poll numbers will get even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   D. WAYNE LUKAS: The highly successful but always controversial
trainer of thoroughbred race horses is taking heat again _ this
time because one of his trainees broke a leg while trying to win
the Triple Crown in last week's Belmont Stakes in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The horse, Charismatic, had taken the world of racing _ the
whole world of sports, for that matter _ by storm when he won the
Kentucky Derby at odds of 31-1 and followed that with an impressive
win in the Preakness Stakes. A Belmont victory would have made him
just the 12th horse to win all three races _ and the first since
1978.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be, but that wasn't the trainer's fault. There was
no indication that Charismatic was anything but sound and healthy
before the Belmont, ready to run the race of his life. Lukas can be
a headline-grabber, and his arrogance can be annoying, but he does
what he does better than anyone else who does it. Which might be
the reason he has so many critics.
</P>
<P>
   MEL TORME: He was never a bobby-sox idol or the king of rock 'n'
roll or the king of pop. He was never as famous as Sinatra or Elvis
or even Tony Bennett _ at least not until he became a recurring
character on the ``Night Court'' sitcom in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   But Torme, who died June 5, was one of the finest vocalists ever
to raise his voice in song _ and more. He was a composer, novelist,
instrumentalist and pretty darn good actor. Put him on the list of
show biz's all-time greats.

RESEARCHERS NOTE UNUSUAL NUMBER OF INTERSEX RODENTS AT REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, already
notable as the place where the chemical element selenium poisoned
thousands of birds, has just presented scientists with a startling
environmental puzzle: an outbreak of hermaphroditic rodents.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the 87 field mice, house mice, deer mice and
California voles trapped during the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's
annual biological monitoring study at the Merced County refuge had
both male and female reproductive organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of intersex mammals was a surprising finding to
everybody,'' Michael Delamore, chief of the bureau's drainage
program in Fresno, said Thursday. ``We're not sure what it means,
because it's new, and the phenomenon hasn't been widely reported.''
</P>
<P>
   While the name Kesterson has become synonymous with selenium, a
naturally occurring byproduct of agricultural runoff, field
researchers don't think that the element _ which can be toxic in
high concentrations _ has anything to do with the increase in
hermaphroditism.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, according to the report by the Sacramento consulting firm
of CH2MHill, is it caused by mutation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the intersex abnormality was seen across four species, it
is unlikely that it is the result of a genetic mutation and it is
probably the result of environmental influences,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Something in the Kesterson environment is causing the
abnormality, but no one knows what.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kesterson is a fairly closed system and no longer
receives drain water from San Joaquin Valley farms, it has no
obvious contaminant sources. Consequently, the report says,
``naturally occurring agents should also be considered as having a
role in this phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Delamore said the refuge was working with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency and the
Regional Water Resources Control Board to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   A mouse and vole trapping program is being launched outside
Kesterson to learn whether intersex rodents are proliferating
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely if anywhere do folks look at critters like we do at
Kesterson,'' Delamore said.
</P>
<P>
   Hermaphroditism has rarely been observed in Kesterson's rodent
population, according to the report. In 1995, for example, just 3
percent of the rodents trapped showed intersex characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 15 of 33 house mice, seven of 30 deer mice, five of 17
harvest mice and two of seven voles showed those characteristics.
Deer and house mice also had enlarged left testes. The findings may
be conservative, because the test animals were examined when female
reproductive structures had not yet enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   Kesterson is located 14 miles north of Los Banos in Merced
County. For six years, beginning in 1979, Kesterson's 12 shallow
evaporation ponds _ part of the 80-mile San Luis Drain, managed by
the Bureau of Reclamation _ were a sump for toxic runoff from farms
in the Westlands Water District on the west side of the San Joaquin
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, an investigation into the cause of the death and
deformation of thousands of birds at the refuge disclosed that
selenium was being deposited in the ponds in massive quantities. It
was responsible for poisoning and causing birth defects in birds at
the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The same year, then-Secretary of the Interior Donald Hodel
invoked the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and closed Kesterson's
evaporation ponds. The San Luis Drain was plugged. In 1988,
Kesterson was drained; now standing water occurs there only during
wet years.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has spent some $50 million cleaning up Kesterson,
which is the only part of the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge
that does not allow cars. The just-published report disclosed that
the refuge still shows higher-than-normal levels of selenium in
both invertebrate and vertebrate wildlife, in its soil and water,
but that the environment is no longer the toxic sump it was in
1985.

FIRST-TIME DROVER RIDES HERD ON A LIFELONG DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When the Fort Worth cattle herd leaves
downtown for its ceremonial trek to the Stockyards on Saturday,
Cathy Cannon will be alongside the longhorns _ every nervous step
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   She changed careers to be part of this cattle drive. She took a
salary cut to work the steers daily, and now she labors nights and
weekends to supplement her income and recover her losses.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon is one of six full-time drovers who will push the newly
formed Fort Worth Herd down North Main Street toward Exchange
Avenue in celebration of the city's 150th birthday. On Monday, the
15-head herd will become a permanent tourist attraction in the
Stockyards.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon and the other drovers will drive them to the Trinity
River banks daily to let them graze.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been a dream of mine,'' said the mother of
three from Weatherford, just west of Fort Worth. ``It's hard to
explain how someone like me, without a ranching background, would
want to do this, but I've always dreamed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Lubbock and raised in Midland, Cannon lived on the
periphery of the livestock business. Her family didn't ranch or
farm, but she participated in local FFA and 4-H projects.
</P>
<P>
   When she left high school to join the Army, she trained as a
veterinary assistant and was assigned to a small animal hospital on
a U.S. base in Germany. It was a good job, she said, and it kept
her involved with animals _ but, again, only on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to join the civilian job force, she found she
needed more gainful employment. She became an X-ray technician and
was working at Harris Methodist Northwest hospital in Azle when a
friend told her about the drover jobs in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she is a full-time part of the livestock industry, of
Texas' ranching heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's drive will be the culmination of a lifelong fantasy,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 longhorns will be penned below the Chisholm Trail mural
at Main and Third streets at 9 a.m. A host of speakers will salute
the herd, the city and the city's western heritage. The Fort Worth
Symphony will provide the background.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony recalling cattle drive traditions, Anne Marion and
representatives of the Waggoner, Reynolds and Matthews families _
all legendary ranching families _ will present the herd tally to
Red Steagall, master of ceremonies for the morning event.
</P>
<P>
   The herd will be moved to Paddock Park at the top of the North
Main bridge, where Marion and riders from her 6666 Ranch will
exchange gifts with Ben Tahmahkera and a delegation of Native
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Marion is the great-great-granddaughter of cattleman and oilman
Samuel Burk Burnett; Tahmahkera is the great-great-grandson of
Comanche chief Quanah Parker. The two men were friends.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10:30 a.m., the cattle will be herded across the
Main Street bridge for a 30-minute drive to the Stockyards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 15 longhorn steers are massive, 1-ton animals with
horn spans wider than 6 feet, Cannon said she is certain the drive
will go well because she and her fellow drovers have done their
jobs in training them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is harder than I thought it would be,'' she confessed.
``There is a lot more mental work than people would think. You have
to learn the cattle, learn the horses, watch them work and
understand how to handle them. It's not just riding a horse all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old Cannon is the only woman among the Fort Worth
cowhands. She's also the most inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intimidating at first,'' she said, ``but everyone
helped. They were all encouraging. They have all been very
supportive from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I don't have as much experience as they do, but I've
learned a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cannon doesn't have to work her extra job this weekend. But next
week, she'll be back on her regular schedule _ Tuesday through
Saturday with the herd, and 16 hours straight, on Saturday night
and Sunday, as an X-ray technician at Harris Methodist. Then she
will work an additional four hours sometime during the week at a
temporary agency.
</P>
<P>
   She also sees to the care and feeding of her family and their
five horses. Daughters Christy and Melinda, son Bryan and husband
Gerry all help.
</P>
<P>
   It is a grueling agenda, but Cannon said she has never feared
hard work and long hours. She is doing it with the blessing and
support of her family, and she is loving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' she said, looking out over the herd, ``this is my
break job. This is like a vacation. I'm not like some of the guys
who grew up doing this kind of work. I don't take it for granted.
I'm just so pleased to be here.''

LAYOFFS EXPECTED AT NUCLEAR LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hundreds of people are expected to lose their
jobs as a Cold War program to use lasers for developing nuclear
fuel is scrapped at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs could affect as many as 500 employees of the lab and
its contractors. A decision on layoffs is expected by the end of
summer at the federal facility that employs 8,000 people east of
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The doomed project is the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation
project, or AVLIS, that aimed to use lasers to find easier ways to
generate fissionable materials for nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   The company that operates the AVLIS facility at Livermore
concluded that the project is not an economically viable way to
generate nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the AVLIS project after 26 years or research means
that Livermore's future _ highly uncertain since the end of the
Cold War _ is increasingly dependent on one glamorous project, the
National Ignition Facility, planned to be the world's bigger laser.
</P>
<P>
   The mega-laser should be finished by 2003, lab officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the AVLIS program, scientists fire big lasers at vaporized
uranium in order to separate it into isotopes, forms of an element
with different weights but closely related chemical properties.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to figure out cost-effective ways to generate
enriched uranium, which has a high concentration of isotopes called
uranium-235, ideal for commercial nuclear reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Once an exciting frontier in nuclear research, AVLIS has fallen
on hard times because of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
abundance of fissionable materials _ such as uranium _ from
dismantled nuclear weapons and other sources.
</P>
<P>
   Also, sales of nuclear fuel have fallen short of early,
optimistic projections, because of strong public opposition to the
construction of new nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Livermore officials managed to corral the United States
Enrichment Corp., a private company established by the government,
into continuing the AVLIS project. With corporate offices in
Bethesda, Md., and a research site at Livermore, the company's goal
was to establish an AVLIS production plant by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the company itself has made the decision to
can the AVLIS project, despite Livermore's desire to continue it,
said Livermore spokesman Jeff Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided it was not commercially viable to continue
research into AVLIS. ... They felt that even if all the science
succeeded, it would still not be commercially viable to produce
nuclear fuel with this technology,''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 people working on AVLIS at Livermore, 200 are
Livermore employees. The rest work for private contractors.

VIDEOS FOR DADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Father's Day around the corner and the NBA
playoffs in full swing, there are a number of new videos that would
make fun gifts _ provided Dad likes sports.
</P>
<P>
   First up is ``Michael Jordan: His Airness'' (listed at $19.95).
Mike may be retired, but only from the court _ the promotional
bandwagon marches on. ``His Airness'' covers Jordan's life from
childhood to his final championship in 1998. The documentary
includes footage from his high school days to his time under
legendary coach Dean Smith at the University of North Carolina to
triumphs with the Chicago Bulls. What becomes evident through all
this is Jordan's undiminished desire to be the best. A number of
NBA greats, including Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas, give
testimony to that, but former Celtic star Bill Russell may have
expressed it best, saying the reason Jordan sustained his level of
excellence was because ``he was determined to be Michael Jordan
every night.'' Despite what seems like undue adulation, it's hard
to argue with the man's accomplishments, and ``His Airness'' is a
fitting and entertaining tribute.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan and a few others like Johnson are models of
top-level consistency, the NBA is filled with players who _ despite
outlandish salaries _ do not show up to play every night. Yet at
any given moment, many of these well-conditioned and talented
athletes can perform jaw-dropping feats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA's 100 Greatest Plays'' ($14.95) compiles some of the
most spectacular plays in basketball history. The 100 plays are
broken down into 10 categories, including: buzzer beaters, dunks,
steals, hustle plays, alley-oops, blocks, moves, assists, clutch
and teamwork plays.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players involved include Johnson, Larry Bird, Julius
(Dr. J) Erving, Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and a couple of current
Lakers _ Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a music video ``Slam Dunk (Da Funk)'' performed by
the recording group Five, featuring other great moments.
</P>
<P>
   The way Kobe and Shaq are playing, though, you won't see them in
the next version of ``Greatest NBA Finals Moments'' ($14.95). You
!ital!will!off! see plenty of former Lakers involved, however.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Johnson _ filling in at center for an injured Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar in the sixth game of the finals _ took L.A. to the
championship with a spectacular 42-point performance. On the other
hand, the Lakers of Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Chamberlain (three
hall of famers) were upset in 1969 and 1970. In 1969, it was by an
old Boston Celtic team with Russell in his last hurrah, and the
next year it was by an undermanned New York Knicks team led by an
injured center, Willis Reed.
</P>
<P>
   If hoops isn't your thing, baseball season is also in full
swing. ``Major League Baseball: Generations of Heroes'' ($19.95)
compares seven groups of players such as power pitchers Nolan Ryan
and Roger Clemens and Giants Willie Mays and Barry Bonds or
home-run hitters Babe Ruth and Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   As any sports fan knows, it's difficult to compare athletes from
different eras, especially baseball with its long tradition. But
fans like to talk and speculate, and this video is fun in that it
can help fuel the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Dad prefers bruising checks and slap shots, you
can give him a rain check until July 16 when ``The Official 1999
NHL Stanley Cup Championship Video'' ($19.98) will be out. It's
already been a bruising and sensational playoffs. Now the finals
between the Buffalo Sabres and the Dallas Stars promise to be
spectacular. (Did I mention I'm from a certain upstate New York
city? Sabres in six.)
</P>
<P>
   If sports isn't your dad's thing, maybe space is. Originally
broadcast in April and May 1998, the epic miniseries ``From the
Earth to the Moon'' (six tapes, $89.92) cost HBO $68 million.
Hosted by executive producer Tom Hanks, the miniseries chronicles
the entire history of NASA's Apollo space program from 1961 to
1972. Each episode is devoted to a crucial aspect of the space
program.
</P>
<P>
   The production has a terrific cast, good writing and talented
directors, and Hanks' well-known enthusiasm for space exploration
is seen throughout every program. Though it is flat at times, the
series leaves you with a deep appreciation of NASA's monumental
exploits. &QL;

 &HT;    Politicking for the Lord
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buena Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   First Southern Baptist Church on Western Avenue in this Orange
County town is a long way culturally and geographically from the
home country of the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But when its minister, the Rev. Wiley Drake, flies into Atlanta
tonight for next week's annual meeting of ``messengers'' of the
15.7 million-member denomination, he plans to make his mark.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, 55, a former rodeo cowboy, is armed with a briefcase full
of resolutions and motions to put before his fellow Southern
Baptists. He'll ask them to tell the president and Congress to quit
``violating people's Second Amendment right to bear arms'' by
supporting gun control. He wants to condemn a report published by
the American Psychological Association that he says is trying to
``water down pedophilia.'' And he'll try to get Baptists to demand
prayer and Bibles back in schools after shootings in Littleton,
Colo., and Conyers.
</P>
<P>
   There will be at least one more, but he's not saying what it
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them to know it's coming,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For Drake, a steel-haired preacher known for his suspenders and
patriotic ties, the paperwork is just business as usual. In recent
conventions, Drake has been the man behind _ or in front of _ some
of the Southern Baptist Convention's most publicized votes.
</P>
<P>
   Drake, whose church is mere miles from Disneyland, introduced
the idea of a boycott of the Disney company in 1996. A year later,
when a convention committee recommended that Baptists not patronize
the company's theme parks or retail outlets, Drake moved from the
floor that the boycott be extended to all Disney outlets and
subsidiaries. His amendment passed overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Drake tried to go further by suggesting that the SBC
change plans for its 2000 meeting, scheduled for Orlando. The
convention's Executive Committee will recommend against a change at
the meeting next week. But Drake does not think the issue is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1998 _ while introducing resolutions on everything from
property control to abortion _ Drake tried to persuade the SBC to
call on Clinton's home church in Arkansas to discipline the
president for his stance on civil rights protection for homosexual
federal employees. The measure failed by only 66 votes of more than
2,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   Drake _ who introduced five of 27 resolutions and two of 27
motions before the SBC convention last year, typical of the last
few years _ is a ``very active participant,'' said the Rev. Bill
Merrell, vice president for convention relations.
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he operates from his sincere convictions, Drake
admits enjoying the sport of politicking. ``There's nothing more
political than Southern Baptists,'' he says with relish. ``You've
got to go to Washington, D.C., to get more political than Southern
Baptists. But I'm glad we're the way we are.''
</P>
<P>
   'Made promise to God'
</P>
<P>
   Drake doesn't have to wait for his annual denominational meeting
for controversy. He has plenty of that on his home turf here in
Buena Park. In fact, he is a convicted criminal.
</P>
<P>
   This theological fundamentalist was found guilty in 1997 of four
counts of violating city ordinances for allowing homeless people to
sleep in a covered, screened patio behind the church and camp in
its parking lot. He is appealing the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, Drake's congregation of about 100 souls officially
dedicated a temporary building, made up of modular units, to serve
as a shelter until a more permanent facility can be constructed.
After making the makeshift building handicapped-accessible and
adding a sprinkler system and fire alarms, Drake was recently
granted an occupancy permit by the city of Buena Park. He is hoping
that now the local courts will remove an injunction that prohibits
use of the building for housing.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it wasn't already full to the brim of homeless men and
women. ``Up to this point, we were occupying the building
illegally,'' Drake freely admits.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he says he believes he was inspired by God to persuade
Baptists to boycott Disney, Drake thinks he was clearly shown by
his maker that he was supposed to take care of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He tells a story he has told many times: Drake had come to Buena
Park in 1987 planning to build up a large congregation and
eventually run for the presidency of the Southern Baptist
Convention. On a crisp November morning in 1989, he walked onto the
grounds to find a dirty, drunken man curled up by the heat vent.
The man smelled of urine, and Drake was disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally grabbed him by his shoulders and shook him,'' said
Drake. ``How dare he come onto God's property drunk!''
</P>
<P>
   The man staggered away and Drake entered the church, where, he
says, he threw his Bible down in anger. It fell open to the book of
Matthew and Jesus' words, ``As you did it to one of the least of
these ... you did it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord seemed to be saying, `You've just kicked me off your
property,''' he says. ``I made a promise to God to never kick
anybody off this property as long as they were sincerely seeking
help. My second promise was to stop trying to build a church and do
my best to minister to the needs of the people he sent.''
</P>
<P>
   For Drake, the moment was one of a series of epiphanies that
have shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam conversion
</P>
<P>
   Born between Hope and Magnolia, Ark., a few miles from Bill
Clinton, he was one of six children of an oil field worker and a
housewife who were casual churchgoers at best. After repeating the
ninth grade, he dropped out of high school to join a traveling
rodeo and circus. He joined the Navy at 17 and married at 18.
</P>
<P>
   He met God in Vietnam. He sat beside a fatally injured young
Marine who begged several times, ``Please don't let me die,'' and
then said his last words, ``I don't want to go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That haunted me for several days,'' said Drake. He talked
about his feelings to a fellow enlistee who was a committed
Christian. ``That's how I really came to know the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake became part of a group of sailors who spent port time
doing mission work.
</P>
<P>
   After discharge in the late 1960s, with a wife and two children,
he enrolled in college and worked as a youth minister at a small
church in Huntington Beach, Calif. On the side, he spent time with
the young people crowding into Southern California as part of the
so-called Jesus Movement.
</P>
<P>
   With a degree in communications from California State University
at Long Beach in 1972, he headed for the largest seminary in the
Southern Baptist Convention, Southwestern in Fort Worth, Texas. But
after seminary, instead of becoming a full-time minister, he took a
higher-paying job marketing oil equipment to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He was living high _ literally _ in New Jersey, ``strung out on
a little bit of everything,'' when he lost his job in 1979. He
parked his silver-gray Cadillac around the corner from the welfare
office to walk to pick up checks for his family, which now included
four children. After 14 months of unemployment, he found himself
lying drunk on the floor of a room at the Holiday Inn in Baton
Rouge, La., where he had gone for a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord seemed to say to me, `Either get your act together or
I'm going to end your life,''' he said. He caught the first flight
back to New Jersey, sold his five-bedroom house and moved his
family into a trailer in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   He took a job as a groundskeeper at Camp Canfield, a Southern
Baptist camp near the Louisiana border. When a 30-member church
nearby needed a preacher, he gave up the camp job and became a
minister, also driving a school bus, working as a stock boy in a
small store, and pumping gas to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a bigger church called him to be pastor, and he moved
to Atlanta, Texas. He made friends with the new managing editor of
the local paper, The Atlanta Citizens Journal, and began writing a
weekly church roundup and commentary. He also began attending the
annual Southern Baptist Convention, writing articles for small
papers in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, sitting in the office of his California church,
``our hearts were always out here,'' as was his wife's family. So
when he heard First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park was
looking for a pastor, he moved to Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   'I had nowhere to go'
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of poor people are glad he did. His church's shelter
can house 52 people, with separate dormitory areas for men and
women. The church's clothes closet, furniture supply and food
pantry offer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Core, 37, has stayed at the shelter for about six months.
Sitting in a folding chair on a walkway, she lifts a cigarette to
her mouth with a tattoo-covered hand. ``I wouldn't have a place.
I'd be in the street,'' she said matter-of-factly. Drake ``told me
when I came here he didn't turn anybody away.''
</P>
<P>
   Toby Chamness, 24, came about the same time. He admits to having
had a drug problem. ``I lost my job, got evicted and my truck got
stolen,'' he said. ``I had nowhere to go. I was living in a
Dumpster.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake, said Chamness, ``is a little too political for my taste,
but I have to admit he's doing a service.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Buena Park officials and Southern Baptist leaders would
probably agree.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Drake has been unnecessarily confrontational in an
effort to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel that the city was willing to work with him ... and
he just didn't want to follow any rules,'' Jim Miller, president
and CEO of another homeless shelter, told the Los Angeles Times
during Drake's criminal trial. ``Even the good Lord said you had to
obey civil authority, but maybe he didn't read that part.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Drake says the attention he gets is in the
interest of what's right, whether it's in a Southern California
courtroom or on the floor of the Southern Baptist Convention. And
he's just using the talent God gave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personality,'' he says, ``is as a scrapper and
rabble-rouser.''

 &HT;    'Jewish Schindler' simply wants to forget
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andre Steiner does not want to share his pain. He does
not want to relive his horror. He won't cry for you.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner simply wants to forget.
</P>
<P>
   And for 60 years, the courtly Atlanta architect did just that.
</P>
<P>
   He never told anyone that he was considered by many a ``Jewish
Oskar Schindler.'' He didn't even share his story with his two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to push my emotions as far back as possible,'' is
how Steiner, 89, described his post-Holocaust philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner's isolation changed when his two sons, George and Peter,
persuaded him to return to his homeland in Eastern Europe. The
result of their journey is captured in a fascinating documentary,
``Andre's Lives,'' scheduled to be shown at the Carter Center on
Wednesday as part of the 23rd Annual Atlanta International Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-day festival, which begins today, features experimental
films and documentaries, many by Atlanta filmmakers. Films will be
shown at several Atlanta venues, including the High Museum of Art,
the Carter Center, and various theaters in Midtown and Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre's Lives,'' produced and directed by Atlanta native Brad
Lichtenstein and funded in large measure by the Atlanta Jewish
Federation and dozens of local investors, is a 55-minute
documentary that explores a form of Holocaust denial _ the kind
that springs from the victims themselves. While many documentaries
are filled with anguished survivors pouring out their stories,
Steiner isn't interested in assuming that role.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner saved the lives of 7,000 Slovak Jews by arranging for
them to work in labor camps instead of being transported to death
camps.But Steiner doesn't want to be called a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his refusal to acknowledge the impact of the Holocaust
on his life provides the film's emotional center.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner's denial is captured most powerfully when he returns to
the mountain village where he last saw his parents. Too frail to
scramble across a looming mountain range, they were captured by
troops in league with the Nazis and later murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner nonchalantly scans the village, shrugs and tells his
sons that he recalls little of the last time he saw his parents
because he refuses to live in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Choked with emotion, Steiner's eldest son, Peter, asks,
``Doesn't it mean anything that you are here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it means to me that this was one of the reasons I
refused to come back,'' Steiner snaps. ``I'm a fool that I did it.
Should I start to cry 60 years after I left my parents?''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner storms off, leaving his sons staring silently at one
another.
</P>
<P>
   His actions may seem puzzling, but there are many Holocaust
survivors like Steiner who don't feel a moral obligation to
remember the past, Lichtenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that there are a large number of survivors who keep it
inside, who don't want to talk it over,'' Lichtenstein said. ``This
has consequences for subsequent generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Those consequences are evident in the documentary. Through much
of the film, Steiner remains emotionally withdrawn from his two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   And at the film's end, he wonders if the homecoming was a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was better to simply forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive images which I had are spoiled now,'' says
Steiner, sitting alone on a train traveling through his homeland.
``Now I have a lot of negative ones.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: In Virginia, I'm an expert on
Texas
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX STATION, Va. -- There's nothing like aristocratic
Virginia, land of huge country estates and narrow country roads,
where wealth and good breeding go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   But here I am, foot in mouth, engaged in cocktail conversation
at a weekend party where I was invited as a friend of a friend in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   And all of a sudden everybody seems interested in what I have to
say.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is George W. Bush, of whom I am expected to possess
insight of an intellectual perspective.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know me very well, do they?
</P>
<P>
   No matter. They want to know what I think.
</P>
<P>
   The host has made that much clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be interested to hear what you think,'' he announced, and
everyone turned in my direction.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now, then there, I began, feeling very much like Dan
Quayle caught in the glare of headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Truth to tell, I think George W. Bush is his father's son, and
what you've already seen is what you'll get a second helping of --
a nice guy who can finish first, at least the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   I was about to add, Ahem, when, thank goodness, a proper lady
interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But how can he be against a hate crimes bill?'' she said, her
faced pained. ``And what about gun legislation in Texas?''
</P>
<P>
   Before I could answer, thank goodness, she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you what my 9-year-old son said, just the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the car and the radio news was on. We don't let him
watch the news on television or read the newspapers. Even the
headlines are so dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is what he said, and keep in mind, this is coming
from a 9-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ```Mother,' he said, `do you know what I would do if I had Bill
Gates's money? I would buy up all the guns in the world and all of
the gun factories, and then I would melt them down and use that to
build a cathedral to peace.'''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the proper lady had to pause in her account, such
was the emotion of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the mouths of babes ...'' she finally managed, her eyes
glistening.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I ask you,'' she said. ``Why can't we do exactly that? Why
can't we simply do away with all the guns? I ask you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, she wasn't really asking me. It was more of a
question for the whole world.
</P>
<P>
   Better to let the whole world deal with it at some point in the
future, preferably after I had left the party.
</P>
<P>
   However ...
</P>
<P>
   If they had really wanted to know about the governor of Texas,
who well might be president of all these United States, as
pertaining to (1) hate crimes and (2) gun legislation, I would say
this:
</P>
<P>
   1. More voters disapprove of homosexuals than approve of them.
Politicians like George W. Bush will conduct themselves
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gun legislation in places like Texas is most likely that
which would limit the liability of gun manufacturers. I don't
expect a whole lot more nationwide, once the gunsmoke has cleared
from our school yards.
</P>
<P>
   But I never got around to saying that. To do so under the
circumstances would have been dreadful, almost as much so as
exposing children to newspaper headlines.

BOND, STRANGELOVE MERGE IN `AP2' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought you were too gun shy to love again in the
long, lifeless shadow of ``The Phantom Menace,'' along comes the
exhaustingly jokey ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a special brand of excitement to mine giddy laughs just
from the New Line Cinema logo floating into place while techno diva
Goldie sings ``Dr. Evil'' on the soundtrack, then send you reeling
seconds later with a ``Long ago in a galaxy far, far away''
scroll-up that explains what Powers (Mike Myers) has been up to
since we saw him last.
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing the nasty with his ladylove Vanessa (Elizabeth
Hurley), who suddenly turns out to be a femmebot assassin sent by
his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers again). Her quick destruction frees
Austin to swing again, and allows Myers to do a supremely inspired
``Benny Hill'' remix of the Oscar streaker.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film rollicks on a similar plane of winking verve,
unrelenting acuteness and observant shenanigans. We learn, for
instance, that the only entity cagey and determined enough to free
Dr. Evil from deep-freeze incarceration is ``The Jerry Springer
Show,'' on which the bald villain with his aquiline nose and
girly-man body language is reunited with his unloved son Scott
(Seth Green) in an episode titled ``My Father Wants to Take Over
the World.''
</P>
<P>
   In a jealous bid to foil Powers, Evil has a time machine built
and sends an obese Scotsman called Fat Bastard (Myers one more
time) back to 1969 to swipe Powers' ``mojo'' _ it's the essence of
sex that comes in a glittering, velvety liquid. Instantly rendered
impotent in mid-shag with a vamp called Ivana Humpalot (Kristen
``3rd Rock'' Johnson), Austin has to get on the groovy train to '69
London to stop him. There, he's reunited with his comely sidekick
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, falling coif-first from the
Barbarella-Bardot beauty tree and hitting every Wonderbra on the
way down).
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the film sinks its teeth into mass-market,
industrial- strength consumerism without ignoring the fact that
``Austin Powers'' has willed itself into a commercial franchise
simply by high-profiling its return as if it were a Second Coming
of its own _ but a knowing one. ``AP2'' shares its audience's
cynicism and contempt of corporate capitalism, while remaining
self-conscious of the hypocrisy involved in skewering brand names _
particularly because AP officially is a market force in itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Evil's lair is a Starbucks Space Needle, with actual
latte-slinging staff; a compartment in Austin's Shaguar announces,
``You've got mail!''; and when a soon-to-be-hilariously-abused
shagamuffin with the appellation Robin Swallows (Gia Carrides)
inquires about Austin's heinie, he whips out a Heine instead.
</P>
<P>
   Are these acts of damnation for the unavoidable omnipresence of
``stuff''? Or are they just smirking, snarling, but explicit
product placements? Both.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' _ directed by Jay
Roach with cagey sarcasm and precision pacing _ that much more
difficult to pin down is that in this virtual climate, it's
plugging real stuff with a heightened preoccupation with the fake.
The film (written by Myers and Michael McCullers), more
successfully than the first, is a collection of arbitrary sketches,
bits and improvs jammed into a locker room-style variety show
masquerading as some semblance of a narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's inherently real or original, from Mini Me (Verne
Troyer), Dr. Evil's bite-size clone, and Xerox soundtrack acts such
as the Monkees, the Guess Who and Lenny Kravitz right down to the
wrong, if ravishing, Graham, who seems so psyched to hang with
Myers that she can't wipe the smile from her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``AP2'' has had to break down into a pastiche mess to weather
times in which an allusive, pop-reference-dependent text succeeds
better than none at all. ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is Bond with
its tongue piercing its cheek. It's ``Blow-up'' with juice, ``Dr.
Strangelove'' hollowed out and colored in, ``Shaft'' with
whiteners, a one-man ``Hard Day's Night,'' you name it.
</P>
<P>
   But, to be sure, this is meaningless, feverish, paradoxical and
mostly smart sniping. Myers is its Peter Sellers-ish master of
ceremonies with a cantankerously funny Mel Brooks vision.
</P>
<P>
   There are large traces of fat around what Myers does _ he riffs
as if there were a bebop wing of screen comedy _ but he has
Sellers' genius for losing himself beneath unflattering get-ups
without compromising the exuberant sharpness of his lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   And only Frau, Mindy Sterling's delirious German frightmare,
threatens to make Myers behave. It'd be too much to bear if he had.

BOSNIA IS TESTAMENT TO DIFFICULTY OF KOSOVO MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSTAR, Bosnia _ The old bridge across the River Neretva was one
of those places where history spoke for itself. At the bridge, as
at the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids, or the Western Wall in
Jerusalem, the very stones had a pulse. You could feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the graceful, white-limestone arch, erected by Ottoman Turks
in the mid-16th century and blasted from its foundations by Bosnian
Croats in the late 20th, lies in pieces on a platform, waiting to
be reconstructed by one of the scores of international governments
and donor agencies trying to put Bosnia back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Physical reconstruction almost certainly will succeed. Such
projects have flowered all over the country since 1995, when the
Dayton accords, a peace agreement brokered by the United States,
put an end to the most savage and destructive fighting Europe had
seen since World War II. But restoring the pulse of the place? That
is a different matter, and may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is full of cautionary tales and lessons for the Americans
and Europeans who, in the wake of the NATO bombing of Serbia, are
setting out to restore 1.4 million ethnic Albanians to their homes
in Kosovo, and to reconstruct their lives in Serbia's southernmost
province. Some lessons tend toward the philosophical, but most are
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Above all is the need for speed. Close behind that comes the
need for a competent civil administration, and the need for the
military to perform some vital civilian tasks to get the return and
reconstruction effort off on the right foot. None of these things
were given immediate high priority in Bosnia, and as a result the
recovery effort has struggled, at best, despite major international
investments of funds and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international presence here is dysfunctional,'' said
Jacques Klein, a top-ranking official in the Office of the High
Representative, which administers the Dayton accords, in an
interview Thursday. ``We do not want to repeat in Kosovo what we
have done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, a former US Air Force general and veteran diplomat, won
praise for overseeing the reversion of Eastern Slavonia from Serbia
to Croatia before taking on the number two job in Bosnia. What will
be most critically needed in Kosovo, he said, is ``a strong, single
chain of command, with a clearly defined mission, and with
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   A rule of thumb, supported by research by United Nations
agencies, is that no more than 50 percent of refugees can be
expected to return home once they have been away from their former
lives for a year. Crops are missed, social circles break down, and
children engage in new lives. With each additional year away, the
number likely to return falls again by half.
</P>
<P>
   Because this reality was not quickly taken to heart, ``we have
to work very hard in Bosnia for small results,'' said Andy
Bearpark, the chief official for refugee return and reconstruction
under Klein.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, while jealousies and turf wars are to be
expected in any major international relief effort, ``I have never
seen it as bad'' as in the Balkans, where many of the nations and
relief agencies involved have long histories and private agendas
with local political groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to find the results of this situation.
</P>
<P>
   High on a dry eastern hillside in Mostar, just past the pile of
stones that used to be the Orthodox Cathedral, a large yellow van
is parked against the wall of a former parish building. From a
distance, it looks like a workmen's van, and suggests the church is
under reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth. The van contains the
worldly possessions of a middle-aged couple who had an apartment in
the neighborhood before the war. Family members made a gift of the
van when the couple was told to get out of Germany. They are
settling more and more deeply into the rubble, building a laundry
area here, a bathing area there, and becoming increasingly bitter
at the reconstruction work going on around them that they do not
understand and that will do nothing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West gives all this money to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
the people have none of it,'' the man said, spitting in the dust.
``We can't do anything. We just sit here.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in the valley, Jelka Kebo, director of the Mostar Culture
Center, which sponsors multiethnic programs for youth and women, is
facing problems of a bureaucratic nature.
</P>
<P>
   The center had some early triumphs, including a youth radio
station and educational programs, that won support from the
European Community and some foundations. But the support is spotty,
and can vanish when she needs it most.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the center is the lead local agency for the Mostar
Summer Festival, a 20-year-old event that has assumed heightened
importance since the war because it attracts the whole community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a letter from the Council of Europe that they will
be donors,'' Kebo said. ``We have not received a penny, and the
festival is July 1 _ unless we cancel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mato Zovkic, the Roman Catholic vicar general of Sarajevo,
said that ``the foreign assistance is far too complicated, both
that which comes from foreign governments and that which comes from
NGOs,'' or nongovernmental organizations. ``They all look very
busy, but there is overlap, duplication, and not very much happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the need for their presence,'' Zovkic said. ``Without
them there would be war. But I wish there were more coordination,
more efficiency. Instead, they struggle for their own visions of
Bosnia. . . . You USA people can hardly grasp why we insist so much
on our ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and the United States, people tend to speak of
repairing societies here which have been damaged by the bitter
years of war. But if the goal is to have democracy and market
economies, ``creating,'' rather than rebuilding, is the correct way
to describe the goal.
</P>
<P>
   There was never democracy, in Bosnia or in Kosovo, before the
onset of the wars in the early 1990s, and no free economy above the
level of local markets. Democracy and open economies, if that is
what there is to be, will have to built through education and
training efforts that easily could take decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of democracy and democratic traditions are the
biggest problems'' in the region, said Jakob Finci, director of the
Soros Foundation in Bosnia. ``You cannot bring democracy here by
NATO and OSCE,'' the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. ``The historic memory is of the communist days, when the
decisions were all made in the central committee, and then everyone
in Parliament just raised their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Making democratic processes and an open economy priorities would
require steps that many who are preparing to launch the relief
operation in Kosovo would rather avoid.
</P>
<P>
   These include such sticky subjects as detaching Kosovo from
Yugoslavia until Yugoslavia becomes a democracy, and disarming the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is not a democracy-friendly force nor
likely to surrender its weapons willingly. Western leaders will be
tempted to accept a few truckloads of weapons and declare the KLA
disarmed, knowing full well that it is not, rather than risk losing
soldiers disarming it forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting fuzzy thinking about these or other goals, said Albert
Rohan, secretary general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry, is a
formula for failure. ``Better for Kosovo to have the plans very
strictly and clearly defined.''
</P>
<P>
   A much more serious concern, according to a well-informed
diplomatic source in Bosnia, is whether some of the most important
players in the soon-to-begin Kosovo effort are willing to address
some of the highest priority needs.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a lack of clarity between the United
Nations and the OSCE about who is to do what in Kosovo, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, military leaders have been told their troops will have
to perform some basic civilian functions, such as setting up water
supplies and electrical systems, and they are unhappy about it.
That leaves Western civilian leaders worried about whether the
military will be prepared to do those tasks within the next few
days, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the source said, the NATO alliance has put the European
Commission in charge of reconstruction, and many relief veterans in
Bosnia believe ``you could hardly find a less competent agency to
do a job of this magnitude with any speed.''

BERTOLUCCI'S GORGEOUS LETDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Told with the distorted ambiguity and hypnotic poetry of a
dream, ``Besieged'' is a jolt of restless sleeping. But who's
dreaming here?
</P>
<P>
   Is it the African woman (Thandie Newton) and British man (David
Thewlis) forced into a tryst in order to make smooth beauty out of
a sexual pairing of the Third World and Imperialist England? Or is
it Bernardo Bertolucci, who's directing with a scaled-down
litheness he rarely displays?
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci always has fashioned political statements out of
coitus, but in ``Besieged'' he's working under a spell that has him
marginalizing the polemical circumstances at stake. His tendency to
half-explain characters isn't mystifying here, it's careless, and
offering the fair-skinned Newton as the symbol-delegate of central
African civil unrest, an emerging Third World and an object of love
situates the film perfectly in America's obsession with
light-skinned, mixed-race deities as the lone shade black women
come in.
</P>
<P>
   Every frame of ``Besieged,'' Bertolucci's 17th film, bleeds with
a gorgeousness and dire radiance that serves as a willful
distraction from the hulking, wanton fetishization and eerie
ignorance that Bertolucci distorts as subtle eroticism.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that after the tourism on display throughout ``The
Sheltering Sky'' (North Africa) and ``Stealing Beauty'' (Tuscany),
he'd have gotten the sightseeing-over-storytelling out of his
system. But the film blinks back and forth between an unspecified
(read: fictional) African country and Rome. It's also afflicted
with that dangerous, reckless, standard mythologizing of Africa as
a nameless monolith of political turmoil, symbolic home of an
emaciated nomadic troubadours and an indigenous people in perpetual
strife.
</P>
<P>
   How Shandurai (Newton) got from her African village _ where her
schoolteacher-political insurgent husband is jailed _ to the Roman
villa owned by Kinsky (Thewlis, clean-shaven, mostly sane, nearly
unrecognizable), a lonely English composer, is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   In order to obtain her permit to study medicine in Italy, she
cleans his home, dusts his statues, makes his bed, hems his pants.
She's haunted by bad sleeps and the uncertainty of her husband's
fate. In the hours when she's at school, he drifts into her
quarters, touching her Kente nightgown. When she's around, he
impales her with his gaze. Then, in a cumbersome, outlandish
confession, he declares that he's in love with her, promising that
if she reciprocates he'll take her back to Africa, the location of
her traumatized state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   What umbrage Shandurai takes at his declaration erodes as she
finds _ rather, the film finds for her _ a reason to begin to love
him back. Had Bertolucci, who co-adapted James Lasdun's short story
with partner Clare Peploe, given psychological gravity to this
narrative bouquet instead of fondling its petals, perhaps the fact
that Kinsky's drowning in a colonial obsession with his African
cleaning lady would exude more heat than consternation.
</P>
<P>
   That Shandurai loves him back is an act of sheer volition, not a
plausible decision of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't people; they're puppets, regardless of what Newton
and Thewlis' mannered performances say.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci is clearly out to have a good, lyric time,
accelerating the frame speed, slowing it down with complete
disregard to implications of his human subjects and how they
behave. ``Besieged'' is simply looking for love, and if there is no
rapture in his script, then the sensuous confluence of Jacopo
Quadri's cutting and Fabio Cianchetti's photography will have to
hypnotically do.
</P>
<P>
   There's the not-so-vague suggestion that Bertolucci might be
trying to pull off one last tango between two forlorn strangers
colliding unexpectedly in a foreign country. But ``Besieged'' has
none of the physical sensuality of ``Last Tango in Paris'' _ it
doesn't aspire to. After 93 minutes, these lovers have lived a
wispy, minor life with unmined consequences in the time it takes to
finish a novella.

   Just a few short weeks ago, the buzz on the Balkans was all bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Times of London was spreading a story that the United States
was seriously considering committing 90,000 troops to a ground war.
The conventional military wisdom resonating with the media was that
no one ever surrendered to an airplane. Public opinion polls
revealed decreasing support for the US role in the NATO campaign
and President Clinton's approval ratings were on a similar
southbound trajectory. Commentators, from the Brahmins of Beltway
punditry to distinguished former generals, were predicting gloom
and doom.
</P>
<P>
   Then on June 4, news of a possible peace agreement surfaced.
Suddenly everything changed, and the pundits popped the champagne.
``I think it's an enormous victory for Bill Clinton,'' said ABC's
Sam Donaldson. Fox News Channel's Morton Kondracke, who had warned
of a US defeat at the hands of a ``tin-pot dictator,'' reversed
course and said that Clinton had taken ``the biggest risk ... maybe
in his whole presidency,'' and emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate over what the United States has actually
accomplished in Yugoslavia may rage for months, the end of
hostilities has already claimed one casualty: the credibility of
talking heads and columnists who advocated either suing for peace
or escalating to a ground war while ignoring the possibility that
the bombing could lead to a settlement without US casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that as we approach the millennium,'' the Balkans
war ``is one of the first-class failures of Washington punditry,''
said Craig Crawford, executive editor of the Hotline political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   What went so wrong with the chattering class? According to
military and media observers, the errant punditry is a result of
everything from misleading Pentagon leaks to Clinton's polarizing
impact on public policy to the failure to understand the evolving
realities of post-Cold War warfare. Perhaps most significantly,
there are also the media's own insistent demands for imprudent and
impatient commentary.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of the 24-hour cable news network, the shouting
heads declared the war over Kosovo lost in a matter of weeks. ``Day
27 and no end in sight'' was the opening line of an April CNN
``Crossfire'' show practically conceding defeat. The battle lines
quickly hardened between those who wanted to cut our losses and go
home and those who wanted to get tougher with Milosevic, with both
sides converging only around the consensus that NATO's bombing
strategy was a loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster for President Clinton and the country,''
declared syndicated columnist and CNN pundit Bob Novak. ``It is
astonishing that those who spent decades recounting the `lessons of
Vietnam' have themselves failed to heed those lessons,'' wrote
former defense secretary James Schlesinger. On a typical day,
people could read Washington Post columns with headlines such as
``Three mistakes,'' ``Bombing empty buildings,'' and ``Bumbling in
Macedonia.''
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that what former ABC diplomatic correspondent
Barrie Dunsmore called this ``negative drumbeat'' began to pierce
public consciousness. Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup
Poll, said surveys showed that the public ``was fairly
pessimistic'' about the conflict and ``strongly'' believed that
ground troops were going to be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know exactly what spawned those views, said
Newport, but ``the public is totally at the mercy of everything
they read and see.'' In an era when the Fox News Channel can air a
debate between one ``expert'' arguing that we pulverize Serbia in a
ground war and another suggesting we disarm its soldiers with
college scholarships, analysts say that much of what passes for
sage commentary is deliberately provocative, extreme, and
oversimplified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern television and modern news don't honor hesitation or
qualification,'' said Pew Research Center director Andy Kohut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the way the media beast works, complexity
and uncertainty don't play well,'' said Rob Leavitt, associate
director of New York University's Center for War, Peace, and the
News Media, decrying the trend for ``punditry to get worse'' with
every passing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe that not only has foreign policy debate become
increasingly politicized, but that Clinton's role as a lightning
rod _ particularly after the impeachment episode _ has further
polarized public discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this town has gotten so obsessed with Bill Clinton's
personal success and failure that everything is filtered through
that prism,'' said Crawford. ``People have this difficulty in
examining issues in any logical way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of skepticism that Clinton could get
something like this right,'' said Kondracke, who is also executive
editor of the Capitol Hill paper Roll Call. ``Nobody had confidence
that bombing would work . . . because the Pentagon generals were
leaking it out that bombing wouldn't work. . . . I just know how I
formed my opinion and I formed it on the basis of talking to
presumptive experts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed unusual, essentially the Pentagon challenging the
administration,'' said Leavitt, noting that the military was
``really using the the media to question what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive parade of military brass who showed up on
our TV screens (the American Journalism Review noted that Kosovo
did for the media careers of military analysts what the O. J. trial
did for lawyers), many of them fell into into the trap of reliving
the lessons of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last-war phenomenon ... was at play,'' noted Thomas
Patterson, the Bradlee Professor of Government and the Press at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Commentators, he
added, were too caught up in the apparent lessons learned in Bosnia
and in the post-Gulf War attacks on Iraq, ``where it took a couple
of days of heightened hostilities to get people to the bargaining
table. ... This is situationally different. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the pundits were quick to argue _ and I
certainly was right there with them _ that you aren't going to
succeed without ground forces,'' said Richard Shultz, the director
of International Security Studies at Tufts University's Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy, who is still wary about the situation
in the Balkans. ``I think it's hard to live on the past lessons.
... War always has a degree of uncertainty to it.''

POLITICIAN SCORNED FOR GOD-LESS PLEA

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ One of Canada's most controversial
politicians has been hurled into parliamentary purgatory for
demanding that references to God be banished from Canada's Charter
of Rights and Freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Svend Robinson, a member of national Parliament, stunned leaders
of every political party, including his own, and ignited anger
across Canada this week when he rose in the House of Commons, after
making sure plenty of journalists would be on hand, and read a
petition urging removal of a passage stating that Canada is
``founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and
the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Robinson told the booing lower chamber, Canada should
be ``founded upon principles of intellectual freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition generated big headlines and angry responses from
other political leaders. ``What do we stand for in this country?
What are the values? What are the morals?'' demanded Parliament
member Randy White, like Robinson representing British Columbia.
``Every time you turn around, you see government slipping lower and
lower into the gutters of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is one of the brightest stars of the leftist New
Democratic Party. He is known as well for his unabashed love of the
limelight as for his passionate advocacy of gay rights and other
not-always-popular causes.
</P>
<P>
   By throwing down the gauntlet to God, he unloosed an unholy
ruckus that has roiled the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than poor political judgment, it's absolutely
stupid,'' said Nelson Riis, a close political ally of Robinson,
fellow New Democrat, and also from British Columbia. ``We find it
to be disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   So did party leader Alexa McDonough of Nova Scotia, who busted
Robinson from the party's prestigious front bench seats in
Parliament, the roost of party leaders empowered to speak during
debate, to the far back row, an especially severe punishment for
Robinson since it obliges him to silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Charter of Rights and Freedoms is Canada's equivalent of the
Bill of Rights. The allusion to God makes no mention of
Christianity or any other faith.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was at first unrepentant, arguing that references to
the supremacy of God are `` discriminatory'' and ``offensive to
Canadians who are nonreligious or non-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the much-chastened politician, who earlier in the
decade became the first Canadian parliamentarian to openly proclaim
his homosexuality, was reading from a different hymnal. ``I deeply
regret the pain and difficulty that my decision . . . has caused,''
he stated in a letter to McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also suddenly insisted that the petition did not
represent his personal view, but had been presented on behalf of
constituents. It is not unusual for members of Parliament to enter
petitions from constituents into the official record, but it is
usually done without fanfare by simply submitting the paperwork to
the house clerk.
</P>
<P>
   In his attack on the charter reference to God, Robinson not only
read the petition in an open session of Parliament but had made
sure that journalists were tipped off.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the New Democratic Party's founders included
religious activists who believed Christian morality should be
applied to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has always been to have God in the
constitution,'' Riis said. ``It's a free country and you are
entitled to be stupid. But what Mr. Robinson did goes beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parliament delivered its disciplinary blow to Robinson the same
day that the federal government backed away from a proposal that
would have abolished the practice of swearing on the Bible before
giving court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Atheists in the country were angered by both moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned by the immense and all-encompassing intolerance of
this country,'' said Ray Blessin, an activist with the Humanist
Association of Canada. ``There's a huge nonreligious community in
Canada, and we object to the intrusion of God into our lives.''

ARGUMENTS AGAINST WAR DIDN'T HOLD UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The successful conclusion of the Kosovo caper deserves a look
backward at some of the most oft-repeated arguments against it.
</P>
<P>
   --``This war is not worth fighting,'' ``This is the wrong war,
in the wrong place,'' or ``These people have been killing each
other since the year 1369; let them sort it out.'' There was only
one alternative to NATO's bombing campaign: Let Slobodan Milosevic
get away with it, ending the bloodiest century in history with the
ethnic purging for which Hitler and Stalin are infamous.
</P>
<P>
   --``The NATO bombing will only worsen, not alleviate, the plight
of the Kosovar Albanians.'' If that were true, why do virtually all
of the Kosovars emphatically support the NATO air war? What about
the 100,000 Albanians who fled before the bombing began? What about
the 2,000 to 3,000 murdered before the first NATO bomb fell?
</P>
<P>
   --``The NATO coalition will fall apart.'' The treaty alliance's
50th anniversary fell awkwardly in the beginning of the elaborately
calibrated air war. President Clinton said Thursday that the
alliance ``is now stronger and more unified than ever,'' while his
critics grind their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   --``Air power alone will never achieve the goal. It'll take
ground troops.'' No ground troops were sent into combat, not one
airman died except in two training accidents, and only two planes
were lost out of a NATO air arm that was 75 percent US.
</P>
<P>
   --``The Russians will turn against the West and resurrect the
Cold War.'' Variations of this theme had the Russians so exercised
on behalf of their fellow Slavs, the Serbs, that US critics of
administration policy ignored the virtual dependence of the Russian
economy on US-backed loans.
</P>
<P>
   --``The Chinese will break with the West over Kosovo.'' The
accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade accelerated
this plaint. In fact, the Chinese dependence on US trade is a
hundred times more important than fears of some sort of trumped-up
US colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   --``Clinton lacks the moral authority to lead the United States
into war.'' This was a favorite of Republicans in Congress and on
the post-impeachment presidential trail. Having lost at Monica
Roulette, the Republicans scrambled for the moral high ground, even
refusing to go on record in support of the NATO bombing effort. The
GOP approach was as shortsighted as it was craven.
</P>
<P>
   --``America's fighting forces, taking their cue from a
conservative-leaning office corps, will refuse to accept combat
orders from a disgraced and nearly impeached president.'' This
theme was big on Bible Belt talk shows, and among Sun Belt
right-wingers who worry aloud over black helicopters, blue berets,
and red-faced impeachment predictors.
</P>
<P>
   --``Public opinion will never stand for it.'' In fact,
choreographing a military action, by definition a bloody business,
among 19 democracies with unfettered news media criticism and
political oppositions not above demagoguing against any policy, is
a ticklish chore. As recently as two weeks ago, public opinion in
the NATO countries was only 49-40 percent in favor of the bombing
campaign that has just succeeded so brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   --``We are playing into Milosevic's hands, by inviting Kosovars
to western sanctuaries and cementing him in place by extinguishing
domestic dissent.'' No and no. He was repeating in Kosovo what
worked for him in Croatia and Slovenia. His iron grip on
paramilitary storm troopers and the propaganda apparatus of Serbia
meant no opponents could get traction. He murdered his biggest
critics, exiled or rendered impotent the rest.
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all the complaints listed above, and the war was won
despite that chorus. There are many Americans, including many in
the media, sincerely convinced that this war was not worth
fighting, and there are some who seem to believe that no war is
worth fighting.
</P>
<P>
   While there were mistakes aplenty _ the tactical ones of using
outdated maps and intelligence to map bombing runs and the
strategic one of failing to comprehend Milosevic is a brutal
psychopath who operates outside the conventions of 20th century
civilized behavior _ the war ended in victory because NATO
persevered.
</P>
<P>
   In US politics, his Republican enemies are yet again humbled by
Clinton. They got it wrong again. When ideological bitter-enders
like Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma prevent Senate confirmation
of people like Richard Holbrooke, the administration's most
experienced Balkan negotiator, or Lawrence Summers as Treasury
secretary, they trifle with important public policies that dwarf
their cheap political causes. Unlike Slobodan, Republicans like
these these don't know when to cut their losses.

went to POGO, which chose to make $350,000 ``grants'' to two

reward the bureaucrats for ``putting their jobs on the line'' by
pressing for action to force repaymenty of royalties. But House
Resources Committee Chairman Don Young says the ``grant'' to a

company lawyers, Young has launched an investigation.

TV EVANGELISTS FIRMLY ROOTED IN DALLAS/FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hottest TV evangelist at the moment is Benny Hinn, a
spirit-filled crusader known for the practice of touching people on
the forehead with his palm, causing them to fall backward as if
``slain in the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   And his announcement that he will move his headquarters to Fort
Worth-Dallas from Orlando, Fla., was good news for both his
advocates and his naysayers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics such as Ole Anthony, president of a watchdog
organization in Dallas, won't have to go as far to investigate
Hinn's international evangelism operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will certainly lessen our travel expenses,'' said Anthony.
He and his associates have journeyed far and wide in recent years,
investigating Hinn and other nationally known TV preachers.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's Trinity Foundation is best known for helping ABC's
``PrimeTime Live'' produce a 1991 documentary that helped unravel
the huge TV ministry of Robert Tilton, whose headquarters formerly
were in Farmers Branch. Among the claims against Tilton was that he
``trashed'' letters from supporters after he took out their checks.
</P>
<P>
   Tilton and his attorneys denied that accusation and sued ABC,
saying the network tried to destroy the ministry. The courts threw
out the suit. Negative publicity, several lawsuits against his
ministry and two marriage breakups have reduced Tilton's ministry
to a fraction of what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony has also investigated Hinn, and reports from those
investigations have appeared on local and national expose-style TV
programs questioning Hinn's lifestyle and his claims of miraculous
healings.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't deter Hinn's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Metroplex should welcome the Benny Hinn Ministries with
open arms,'' Ruth D. Allen of Fort Worth, a Southern Baptist who
donates to Hinn's ministries, wrote to me. ``I guarantee they will
be an asset to the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Rodriguez of Fort Worth said she is proud to be one of
Hinn's ``partners,'' a term she said is given to people who donate
at least $1 a day to his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The partners met in Houston and we were the first ones to
learn that Pastor Hinn would be moving from Orlando,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the partners were told that $5 million is being raised
to begin building a headquarters somewhere near the Dallas/Fort
Worth Airport.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't mind the critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other evangelists have gone wrong,'' she said. ``If they do,
we just stop giving to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth-Dallas has been a hotbed _ and a graveyard _ for
nationally known evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   One former high-profile evangelist, W.V. Grant Jr., who was
investigated by Anthony and others because of his healing claims,
spent a short time in prison for misuse of ministry funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Grant's church building, which he called the Eagle's Nest,
has risen from the ashes of his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   It is now the Potter's House Church, one of the fastest-growing
congregations in the nation. The pastor, T.D. Jakes, has a national
TV ministry and he has baptized Deion Sanders, Emmitt Smith and
some other members of the Dallas Cowboys football team.
</P>
<P>
   Another evangelist who lives in the Fort Worth area, Kenneth
Copeland, has been a top 10 television preacher for years. He and
his wife, Gloria, have their headquarters on the banks of Eagle
Mountain Lake, northwest of Fort Worth. They teach that Christians
can be spiritually, physically and financially prosperous if they
follow God.
</P>
<P>
   The Copelands have their critics. One of them, author Hank
Hanegraaff, calls their prosperity theology a ``counterfeit''
gospel that ignores some core teachings of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known evangelist James Robison, who with his wife, Betty,
hosts a nationally televised Christian talk show, has his
headquarters in Euless. Paul and Jan Crouch, the leaders of the
Trinity Broadcasting Network, one of the largest Christian TV
networks, have a glittering facility in Irving that looks very much
like the nation's White House.
</P>
<P>
   So Benny Hinn will have a bit of company.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Hinn's followers, Tincy Burns of Fort Worth, said her
life has been changed since she began watching his television
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited he's coming to Texas,'' she said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Her philosophy is to ignore criticisms of Hinn and let his
ministry speak for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is doing something wrong, God will punish him,'' she
said.
</P>

CARMAX MAKING A PLACE FOR ITSELF IN NO-HAGGLE AUTO SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB COX 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER, Texas _ It's been an uphill battle, but CarMax Auto
Superstores is gradually carving out a slice of the retail auto
business _ and getting close to making money at it, too, says
Austin Ligon, president of the Richmond, Va.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   CarMax was built on the premise that consumers should be able to
buy new and used cars in much the same way they buy computers,
televisions and appliances from CarMax's parent company, Circuit
City Stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company hasn't been as financially successful as hoped,
Ligon acknowledged in an interview Thursday at the grand opening of
CarMax's newest Fort Worth-Dallas location, a
Chrysler-Plymouth-Jeep dealership in Lancaster. But he said that's
not because the company's concept of no-haggle pricing and
customer-friendly sales practices isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind the plan. We projected we'd lose money for the
first four years in business and break even in the fifth,'' Ligon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after opening its first store, CarMax finally turned a
small profit, 3 cents a share, in the first quarter that ended May
30. When the company's fiscal year ends in February, CarMax will
post a small loss or break even, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Selling cars hasn't been CarMax's problem, Ligon said. Almost
all of CarMax's 35 separate locations have high sales and are
solidly profitable, he said. But the costs of expansion, building
the company and implementing standardized systems has been greater
than projected.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster location is CarMax's first new-car outlet in the
Metroplex, joining the three used-car superstores, including one in
Fort Worth. CarMax acquired Hilltop Chrysler-Plymouth of Lancaster
and the Jeep franchise rights of Red Bird Jeep-Eagle in Duncanville
to form the new outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll more than double the size of this store,'' Ligon said.
``We should be able to have 300 to 400 new cars and 250 used cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is simply to become the biggest
Chrysler-Plymouth-Jeep dealer in the market and offer a very
successful used car superstore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster store won't be CarMax's last in the area, either.
Ligon said the company plans to open a used car outlet in Plano
next year and could pursue a sixth Metroplex location, probably in
west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   CarMax's lack of profitability so far isn't a good indication of
the company's impact on automobile retailing, according to one
industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had a tremendous impact, but unfortunately they're not
benefiting,'' said Eric Noble of Auto Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, it's a question of surviving long enough to reap the
benefits of the change. It's like the pioneers get the arrows,
settlers get the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble said that CarMax and AutoNation have been handicapped by
the high costs of entering the business. Existing dealerships, he
said, often have a huge advantage in that they own the land and
facilities on it.
</P>
<P>
   If CarMax or some other large chain ever puts together enough
buying clout to command price discounts from auto manufacturers,
much as Wal-Mart does with its merchandise, they will have a huge
competitive advantage, Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Ligon said, he foresees about 250 new- and used-car
CarMax locations nationwide, although it may be years before that
goal is reached. One of the impediments to growth, he said, is in
state franchise laws and other legal obstacles in the path of large
companies like CarMax and AutoNation.
</P>
<P>
   Ligon likens his company's experience to that of Southwest
Airlines and says that if consumers like the way CarMax and other
companies try to simplify buying cars, the large chains will grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is still in charge. The good ideas tend to win
out in the marketplace. ... It took years for Southwest Airlines to
get to the East Coast. That didn't mean it (Southwest) wasn't a
great idea.''

GRAPPLING WITH MEMORY'S MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AFTER LIFE &QL; 
Directed and written by: Hirokazu Kore-eda &QL; 
Starring: Arata, Erika Oda, Susumu Terajima, Takashi Naito, Kei
Tani, Taketoshi Naito, Kayoko Kagawa, Kisuku Shoda &QL; 
Running time: 118 minutes &QL; 
Rated: Unrated &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is memory? How ephemeral is it? What kind of meaning can it
give life? A heartfelt and ultimately poignant grappling with these
questions distinguishes Hirokazu Kore-eda's ``After Life'' from
most Western films that deal with the betwixt and between of life
and death.
</P>
<P>
   In this genre as we know it in the West from such films as
``Outward Bound,'' ``Stairway to Heaven,'' and ``Defending Your
Life,'' heaven can wait while it is decided to which afterlife this
or that character will go. This Japanese take on the imparting of
meaning to life before leaving it demands patience, but richly
repays it as the film leads us into a contemplation of human
experience few others even notice.
</P>
<P>
   Here there is no judgment made of the newcomers to the shabby
way station that suggests a run-down school or hospice run by civil
servants who blandly and formally process each week's new arrivals.
But the newcomers are by no means let off the hook. When they check
into the nondescript facility on a Monday they are told they have
until Wednesday to select a memory. It will then be filmed in a
makeshift studio, screened for them by the weekend, and given to
them to accompany them into the afterlife. Their other memories
will be erased. As the interviews proceed, with the camera standing
in for each interviewer, we realize that although everyone looks
earthy enough, they are in fact dead.
</P>
<P>
   By Japanese standards, the film is quite droll as we learn that
the ones doing the questioning are those who for one reason or
another could not choose a memory, and so remain in limbo in the
facility and put to work there. Not that the interviewers are
without passions. One young woman (Erika Oda) has fallen for a
colleague (Arata) who, although young-looking, has been there since
World War II. When the recollection of one old man jars the
interviewer into possibly selecting a memory of his own, the young
fellow staffer who has a crush on him is not happy. But it isn't
conventional drama or plot twists that make ``After Life'' moving.
Rather, it's the exquisitely tender memories that come floating to
the surface of this or that interviewee's mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if, having been jarred loose from an ocean floor, the
memory floats up to the surface to be reveled in, wondered at. One
old woman decides to take with her the memory of a dance lesson. An
old man talks big about sex, but in the end decides to carry with
him the memory of his daughter's wedding, at which she handed him
her bouquet. A teenage girl wants to take with her the memory of a
trip to Disneyland and is informed, with a more than detectable
trace of sadness by her interviewer, that 30 other girls have
chosen the same memory in the last year. A slightly punked-out
young man, who hasn't lived that long, says he can't possibly
choose. A 72-year-old man has the same problem and is handed 72
videocassettes, one covering each year of his life, to jog his
memory.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, memory itself becomes the star of the film,
precious, perishable, vivid, hooked to sense memories of mundane
and otherwise unremarkable events, such as one man's insistence
that he can recall the sun shining on his body when he was less
than a year old. ``After Life'' is governed by Kore-eda's
background as a documentarian. His style is spare and elegant and
subtly layered as the faces and the expressions on them (including
nonprofessionals) become the delivery system for a life-affirming
connection to a wide range of human experience. Kore-eda actually
went out and interviewed many people, then came back and distilled
their replies into this film. The interplay between the real
memories, their transformation into a screenplay and a film within
a film adds to the resonance of this exercise that goes beyond
documenting the life of postwar Japan to give us deeper truths that
go beyond mere fact.

A RIVETING LOOK AT A LITERARY LION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETSY SHERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
LET IT COME DOWN: THE LIFE OF PAUL BOWLES 
Directed by: Jennifer Baichwal 
Running time: 73 min. 
Rating: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian filmmaker Jennifer Baichwal has made a handsome,
fascinating portrait of Paul Bowles, the octagenarian who is best
known for his novels (``The Sheltering Sky'') and short stories,
his complicated marriage to writer Jane Bowles, and his longtime
status as an American expatriate in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Even newcomers to Bowles's work will be impressed by his stature
as a figure who touched the major arts movements of the 20th
century, from a period in his 20s as a protege of poet Gertrude
Stein in Paris, to a significant career as a composer who interwove
influences from Tin Pan Alley to Stravinsky, and as an elder
brother to the Beats, who joined him in drug-abundant Tangiers in
the 1950s. As a closeup look at an old lion, the film is riveting:
there are subtle ripples beneath Bowles's placid face as he mixes
confession and obvious denial, looking back on a full life that he
seems compelled to dismiss as not very special.
</P>
<P>
   Always present is the atmosphere of Bowles' adopted home,
Tangiers. Arabic chants bubble up on the soundtrack, and shots of
the desert landscape that Bowles loves are intercut with the
interviews. It was during the 1930s that Bowles was dispatched to
Tangiers by Stein to keep tabs on another protege. He made that
trip with Aaron Copland, who was horrified by the ``madhouse'' of
North Africa. Says Bowles in the film, his Yankee intonations
providing instant irony, ``I was completely overjoyed because I
thought that it was a madhouse, completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles was born in Jamaica, N.Y., in 1910, into an ascetic _ and
anti-religious _ household. He discovered release (from boredom, he
says) in writing and music. He fled home for Paris, the stint in
the Stein household proving educational, if humiliating. His
subsequent work as a composer is explored in the film via a 1995
tribute performance by the Eos Orchestra at Lincoln Center (the
film also records a 1995 meeting at the Mayfair Hotel reuniting
Bowles, William Burroughs, and Allen Ginsberg). In the '40s,
Bowles' music and fiction careers overlapped. Bowles' prose, which
exhibits a violence that the writer says has never been present in
his life, is read by Tom McCamus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Bowles wed Jane Sydney Auer, who shared his passion for
travel. He describes how they were opposites in temperament, she an
optimist and he a pessimist, but there's no doubt that they were
soul mates. But among the array of friends and commentators in the
film, there seems to be an agreement that the love of Bowles's life
was the Moroccan painter Ahmed Yacoubi. Bowles's sexuality is an
area around which he steps gingerly. Burroughs derisively redubbed
Bowles' 1972 autobiography ``Without Stopping,'' ``Without
Telling.''
</P>
<P>
   The talking-head sequences of Bowles are the movie's prize.
Baichwal shoots him in closeup against a black background, in a
chiaroscuro that makes his proudly etched face seem like a floating
bust of a Roman senator. Bowles' soft voice and formal manner of
speech understate his often startling pronouncements. For the
documentary camera, the artist does a veil dance between the poles
of monster and victim, but never lays himself bare. He proves to be
as unknowable as he himself has called the Muslim culture. Among
his parting words are these: ``I think people are planets, floating
spheres. So if they touch, they touch at one tiny point. ... In
general, they fly around, self-sufficient.''

BERTOLUCCI CRAFTS A POLISHED BUT FLAWED GEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the likelihood of bad dialogue swamping most love stories,
there's something to be said for a love story played out as a
string of mostly nonverbal convulsions. Bernardo Bertolucci's
``Besieged'' sets us up for one, but in the end doesn't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it sets us up for quite a lot. Racial and sexual
politics seem on track to converge provocatively in the film that
begins with Thandie Newton's Shandurai stunned at the imprisonment
of her schoolteacher husband by the repressive regime running their
African country. Cut to a side street in Rome, where Shandurai is
next seen working as a domestic for an eccentric British pianist,
David Thewlis's Kinsky, who inherited the house from his aunt.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in her own quarters downstairs and busily leads the
demanding life of a medical student when she isn't fetching and
carrying for the pianist, who doesn't do much of anything when he
isn't flailing away at his Steinway. Lack of occupation may be his
biggest problem. Idle mind and all that. At any rate, it doesn't
take Kinsky long to fall for Shandurai. Except for a handful of
students, he has no friends, and doesn't go out much. Given their
mutual confinement, it's only a matter of time until he follows up
leaving little presents for her by blurting out an agonized
declaration of love for her. When he says he'll do anything for
her, she suggests he try freeing her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Because both characters remain both superficial and opaque, we
never believe in the depths of feeling we're asked to buy into, or,
for that matter, the depths of character that must be present to
give rise to any feelings at all. We do get the sense that each is
a foreigner floating unanchored in the little Roman side street
they provisionally share. When an Italian medical school classmate
(Claudio Santamaria) comes on to Shandurai, Newton tempers
Shandurai's aversion to his advances with her own loneliness.
Similarly, isolation rather than emotion nudges her toward the
pianist.
</P>
<P>
   Because they don't speak much, and likely wouldn't have much to
say to each other if they did, Bertolucci lets music do the talking
for them. This proves a major miscalculation. It's one thing to
have Shandurai play African music to shore up her assaulted
identity while the pianist sits upstairs giving Western music a
heavy workout. But when he suddenly is rejuvenated and composes a
clangy new work borrowing heavily from African rhythms, the film's
master-servant, First World-Third World dialectics start crumbling
fast. Thewlis's Kinsky is an emotional loose cannon, and the script
can't seem to decide whether Shandurai is a competent modern woman
or a shy, subservient one. ``Besieged'' looks good. It even looks
raw and immediate. But it's ultimately about worlds in avoidance,
not collision. In ``Besieged,'' nobility does battle with a vacuum,
and the vacuum wins.

A CHARITABLE ARMY'S RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ubiquitous red kettles and bell ringers at Christmastime. A
convenient bin to receive donated clothes. A shelter for the
homeless. These are the familiar images most people have of the
Salvation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But the army is not just a powerful and successful charity. It
is first and foremost an evangelical Christian church born in
England and exported to America in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   How a small band of fiery streetcorner evangelists _ in the
beginning derided as vulgar exhibitionists _ evolved into a
formidable charitable organization that raises more than $1 billion
annually is the focus of Diane Winston's superb new book.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Red Hot and Righteous: The Urban Religion of the Salvation
Army,'' Winston, a journalist and research fellow at New York
University, combines intelligent insights, rich anecdotes, and
telling facts to chart the remarkable ascent of the Salvation Army
from 1880, when it landed on US shores, to 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The book's finest and most compelling moments come when Winston
adroitly profiles the army's evolution into a mighty charitable
engine. As the army gained greater acceptance, church leaders
realized that before it could successfully promote personal
salvation it needed to deal with social salvation by addressing the
squalid conditions of society's downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Winston provides one intriguing reason for the army's turn
toward social activism: its failure to win converts among the lower
classes. In the 1890s, she writes, the Salvation Army began
referring to itself as a religious and philanthropic organization.
``While the Army may have failed at saving slum dwellers' souls, it
was able to allay their physical needs,'' Winston notes.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning at the end of the last century and continuing into
this one, the army rapidly expanded its social services. ``Between
1904 and 1913 the number of relief institutions grew from 195 to
413,'' writes Winston, who makes good use of primary sources to
buttress her arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army cemented its reputation for good works in
World War I when it mobilized ``sallies,'' groups of women who
served American soldiers in France. ``Salvationist work in World
War I wove together themes of action, gender and patriotism,''
Winston writes. ``Fashioned into a shining tapestry of God,
country, and motherhood, these themes hallowed the Salvation Army
as America's own nonsectarian faith, a religion of action.''
</P>
<P>
   As Winston skillfully shows, the Salvation Army was the first
American religion not only to embrace but to appropriate popular
culture to promote its message to a broad spectrum of society. The
parades, vaudeville acts, brass bands, and uniforms were all a
marked contrast to the reserved practices of more established
religions. The Salvation Army, Winston points out, was savvy when
it come to public relations. It got itself noticed.
</P>
<P>
   As much as anything, Winston shrewdly notes, the army needed
attention if it was to gain a foothold on the American religious
landscape. ``Unlike other faiths, the Army did not have a natural
constituency; during its formative years, no one was born a
Salvationist,'' Winston writes. ``People converted or contributed
because they saw the Army in action. That required the Army to go
where people worked and lived _ and to reach out in ways the public
could understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The army's successful marketing helped overcome the initial
suspicion that greeted church members and laid a solid foundation
for the future. Winston also gives us a vivid and absorbing glimpse
into how the Salvation Army opened doors to women and stoked
debates on feminism. For middle- and upper-class women, in
particular, the army provided opportunities for organizational
leadership and grass-roots activism. Even though the ability of
women Salvationists to progress was still limited, Winston writes
that the Army was the ``first Christian group in modern times to
treat women as men's equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston's fine book is a remarkable tale not just of the rise to
prominence of the Salvation Army but of the interplay between
religion and culture _ a dynamic that is still alive and well.

   According to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics
professor Lester Thurow, it is because the United States is
remarkably flexible. It is a country that is willing to embrace the
new and toss out the old.
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said about Thurow himself. In an interview
this week to promote his new book, ``Building Wealth,'' Thurow
seemed to have discarded most of the ideas he has been peddling for
the past 20 years in favor of some new and different ones.
Apparently economists can be flexible, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of books, beginning with ``The Zero-Sum Society'' in
1980, Thurow praised the government-directed economies of Europe
and Japan and criticized the United States' economy. A Washington
Post review of Thurow's 1992 book, ``Head to Head,'' summed up his
take on the US economy this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not kept up with our major competitors; we've let
manufacturing erode; we've allowed our schools to fail; we've
focused too much on short-term financial rewards; we haven't saved
enough; our deficits, at home and abroad, are shameless.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is something of a surprise to pick up Thurow's latest book
and read lines like ``America is back'' and ``all of Europe is an
also-ran.'' The new Thurow reminds you a bit of the movie character
Austin Powers, who after waking up from a 30-year sleep and
learning that the West has won the Cold War, shouts ``Groovy,
smashing, yeah capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurow concedes he got some things wrong in the past, but he has
a defense. ``It's not because I was dumb,'' he says. ``No one saw
the technological revolution coming.'' At 61, Thurow still looks
terrific and speaks incredibly fast.
</P>
<P>
   Technology changed the rules of the game, says Thurow. If the
1980s was about making old things a little better _ cars,
semiconductors _ the 1990s is about making brand new things. It is
a game that plays to the United States' strengths. We have the
right ``genetic material,'' is the way Thurow puts it.
</P>
<P>
   When Thurow's son studied engineering at Stanford University, he
took a course in creative thinking. ``That wouldn't happen in
Tokyo,'' he says. Thurow himself serves on the board of E-Trade,
one of the hottest of the Internet finance companies, so he has
seen the new economy up close.
</P>
<P>
   This ``third industrial revolution'' has created the opportunity
to make large fortunes, much the way earlier industrial revolutions
did. So why aren't the Europeans making these fortunes, too?
</P>
<P>
   They lack the entrepreneurs to take advantage of the new
opportunities. ``They've created a no-risk society in Europe,''
says Thurow. ``They're too conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Europeans shrink from the new and cling too tightly to the old.
Europe's refusal to accept food that has been biologically altered
``sounds an awful lot like the fears and restrictions imposed on
China five hundred years ago when it closed its doors to outside
influences,'' Thurow writes.
</P>
<P>
   He says that Europeans have to be willing to blow up their old
companies, arguing that the ``destructive'' side of ``creative
destruction'' is critical for success. The United States could not
have done as well, says Thurow, if big companies like AT&AMP;T and IBM
had not jettisoned thousands of workers in unprofitable lines of
business. Europe must do the same or be content to fall farther
behind in the race to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, another Thurow favorite in the past, has all the same
problems as Europe plus a terrible financial crisis. The latter
must be tackled before the country can get on the right track,
Thurow says.
</P>
<P>
   In his earlier books, Thurow was a big advocate of government
intervention in the economy. He favored governments that picked
winners and losers, and governments that managed trade. He doesn't
say that any more.
</P>
<P>
   The only government policies he credits with boosting the US
economy are very old ones _ government-supported research for
medicine and defense, which helped create the modern biotechnology
and computer businesses. Thurow says President Clinton and Federal
Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan may have helped a little at
the margin, but both their efforts pale compared to the impact of
the technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
   How long can the revolution last? Thurow doesn't know. But he
points out that the revolutionary eventually becomes the
commonplace and that the huge profits earned by leading-edge firms
will eventually give way to more commonplace profits. Are you
listening, Mr. Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Thurow doesn't offer any specific advice for investors, but he
suggests that the United States will remain the world economic
leader for the forseeable future and that it will take some time
for Europe and Japan to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, given Thurow's track record on predictions, you might
want to buy some European and Japanese stocks just to be on the
safe side.

STILL A HARLEY HAVE-NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hot spring nights remind me that for years it seemed inevitable
I would one day have my Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Like thinner hair and liver spots (``barnacles of age,'' my
dermatologist calls them), the time would arrive when, like any
natural progression, life's path would have crossed some
demarcation line and there it would be suddenly in my garage: a
1,200cc gleaming Harley-Davidson motorcycle with a custom burnished
leather saddle and just enough chrome to accent the subtle depth of
its British racing green paint job _ all to carry me back to my
youth.
</P>
<P>
   My concession to maturity would be to keep the factory baffles
in the pipes that create that strangely mellow Harley rumble, as
understated and sweet as a French horn. I'm older. None of that
ear-tearing gnash of straight pipes for me.
</P>
<P>
   I would nod to baffles and a conventional helmet (``brain
bucket,'' as my medical sister darkly calls them) rather than one
of those black plastic beanies riders wear to show they are rebels.
They would be wearing no helmet at all if only the bureaucratic
fuddy-duddies bent on taking our freedoms and Camels away let them
ride the range as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll look like an old fool,'' said a person in my life who
readily shares such opinions. ``Don't think you're getting me on a
motorcycle. I've paid those dues.''
</P>
<P>
   She meant that, as a young bride some 32 years ago, her mother
holding a Kleenex to her nose and her father looking on in grim,
helpless alarm, this woman climbed onto the back of a motorcycle
behind her new husband to ride eight hours to their newlywed bower
up in the north woods of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I'm not too old for it,'' she added, ``I've gotten too
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   I should have, too. In fact, I did own several motorcycles in
days past, spent most of a decade riding, off in the woods and on
long trips on highways and back roads. It should be out of my
system, right?
</P>
<P>
   But still every spring, skis put away, grass fertilized,
forsythia bursting, I hear that first sweet rumble on a spring
night and my ears tune in to the exact pitch, not duplicated by any
brand of motorcycle. The truth is, in all my riding days I never
had a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I'm into some retro Hell's Angels thing. As an
attendee of the last 20 or so Allman Brothers concerts at Great
Woods, I always go check out the Harleys and the guys riding them.
They roll in like those gangs of old, the Angels laying seige to
some little country town, Brando in the lead _ all a reenactment of
cowboy movies.
</P>
<P>
   These days their Harleys may still gleam and roar, but the
Senior Angels are a sad-looking lot: old, toothless lions who've
lost their roar. Biceps sagging out of sleeveless leather vests,
gray beards and guts hanging on the gas tanks, dated tatoos awash
in hoary fur, the old Angels have become almost pure comedy.
</P>
<P>
   I know this and, as an adult, I also know now that motorcycles
are dangerous, tiring, inconvenient, limited by weather, and not
sociable. I know that listening to Mozart in an air-conditioned car
is a hundred times more comfortable. And I also know that there are
probably a lot better motorcycles out there than Harleys, from BMWs
to Hondas to Ninjas.
</P>
<P>
   But for years I had been making a secret promise to myself that
after the domestic obligations of child raising and college tuition
were finally discharged, my middle-aged angst would be expressed in
the mellow rumbling of a Harley.
</P>
<P>
   Why a Harley I can't exactly say. Years back life couldn't offer
up much better than a Triumph or BSA. But somewhere along the line
Americans fell in love with Harley-Davidson, perhaps after the
Japanese taught them how to make a superior bike, and I fell, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a Springsteen ``Born in the USA'' kind of thing.
Whatever, the question is not technical but one of the heart.
Harley is summer. That insouciant rumble rings with the chords of
ancient rock 'n' roll _ Elvis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry . . .
</P>
<P>
   That rattling purr brings back hot nights and the arcade aroma
of dime store perfume mingling with fried clams and salt air.
</P>
<P>
   It is the promise of the open road, the next town and the next
state, the Rockies, the desert, the West Coast . . . that
peculiarly American optimism that if you want a better life just
get in the saddle and ride for it. Hail the road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' she asked a couple of years after my first raving,
``where's your Harley?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' I told her. ``I'm afraid if I bought one
I'd ride it to the beach a couple of times and put it away in the
garage to collect dust.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't exactly that, though I suspect some truth there.
Nor is it the fear of being taken for a lapsed, paunchy,
white-bearded fallen Angel myself.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I still get misty about Harleys, and I stop to watch one go
by when I hear that unmistakable throaty rumble, but now I know I
won't get one and here's the real point:
</P>
<P>
   A sentimentalist mourns his innocence while a true romantic
misses the fun of losing it, knowing it can be lost only once.
After all, it is a rare summer indeed that delivers on the promise
of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Vroom. Vroom.

PUTTING OUT THAT CIGAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Satcher is going one-on-one with Michael Jordan, one of
the greatest basketball players ever. He is defending against Wayne
Gretzky, the greatest hockey player ever. He is batting against
Yankee pitching star Orlando Hernandez. He is swinging clubs
against golfing great Tom Watson.
</P>
<P>
   He is matching wits against World Series champion manager Toe
Torre, six-time NBA champion coach Phil Jackson and 1986 Super Bowl
champion coach Mike Ditka. He is trying to outgab four-time Super
Bowl champion quarterback and broadcaster Terry Bradshaw and former
football star and broadcaster Ahmad Rashad. He is trying to stop
Hall of Fame lineman Mean Joe Greene. In fact, he is trying to
score against the entire National Football League Players
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher is taking them on, all at once. He has no choice. He is
the surgeon general. All of these stars are cigar smokers and will
fumigate you if you don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first choice is that we will be able to cooperate,''
Satcher chuckled over the phone Thursday when reminded of the stars
who smoke. ``But I have been a fighter all my life. Wherever we
find barriers to health, we try and get through.''
</P>
<P>
   A study in the current New England Journal of Medicine confirmed
common sense assumptions about cigar smoking, the fad of the
prosperous 1990s. The study found that cigar smokers had twice the
risk of mouth, throat, and lung cancer as nonsmokers. The risks go
even higher with three or more drinks a day.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the rise in cigar smoking in California, from 1-in-20 men
to 1-in-11, Satcher wrote in an accompanying editorial in the
journal, ``We must do a better job of educating the public,
especially children and adolescents, about the risks to health
associated with cigar smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   The job will be hard. Since celebrity easily trumps common
sense, Satcher is trying to chase Jordan, Gretzky, and the rest
with a heavy limp in the arena of public influence. Most of the
above stars have given long interviews to smoking magazines that
reinforce the idea that cigars signify being on top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true with athletes, who already have a
well-developed sense of superiority and invulnerability. The best
example was Jordan and the Bulls. Nearly the whole team smoked last
year on their way to their sixth and last title. Dennis Rodman gave
teammates humidors for Christmas. Jordan opened a cigar bar near
the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   They smoked so much that even Jackson, who loves cigars as ``a
way to celebrate the good feeling of what life can bring us,'' had
to crack down on his players during the playoffs. ``I would tell
them they should only be smoking one cigar per day because of the
detrimental effects so much smoke can have on their physical
conditioning and the efficient working of their lungs,'' Jackson
told Cigar Aficionado last fall. ``Unfortunately, I've still seen
some of the guys smoking as they drive up to the arena right before
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   They lit up big time on TV after winning the title, so much so
that delegates to the American Medical Association voted 474-1 to
urge sports leagues and television networks not to show tobacco
smoking by athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA's action is a start. Since Satcher would find it
laughably futile to point fingers at athletes who can wave
championship rings while they blow smoke in his face, he would be
better off appealing to sports commissioners and players
associations. The marketing arm of the NFL Players Association this
year endorsed a cigar line, using the name of Hall of Famer Tony
Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   He should urge the commissioners to tell players and coaches
that given the risks of cigars and their influence in society, they
should be discouraged from smoking when they represent the team (he
should also include chewing tobacco). He should ask players'
associations to refrain from endorsing tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher should ask the networks to ask their broadcasters to
stop parading cigars. Active players and coaches should be fined
for giving interviews that essentially serve as free advertising
for cigar companies, a sophisticated, upscale way of circumventing
the advertising bans of the new national tobacco settlement. A part
of every interview of a sports figure in Cigar Aficionado focuses
on the figure's favorite cigars.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lot for Satcher to catch up with the world's most
incredible athletes and successful coaches. But this week's news
should take some of the limp out of Satcher's legs. He is one study
closer to exposing this symbol for being on top of the world as a
faster way of being lowered to the bottom. ``I believe that they
care about children and do not want to advocate something that can
cause death and disability in children,'' Satcher said. ``I believe
that if we can get that message across about cigars, we will see a
change.''

PAGING DR. GREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the difference between a shyster and an entrepreneur? In
the case of former surgeon general C. Everett Koop, about $41
million.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who has been hanging his hat up at Dartmouth Medical
School, is the centerpiece of www.drkoop.com, the latest in a
series of medical Web sites that dole out information to a vast new
public of HMO-traumatized ``cyberchondriacs.'' Koop and his
business partners are betting that his hard-won reputation for
integrity as surgeon general during the Reagan years will lure
clients to the site to seek medical advice and to buy ``drkoop''
products.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, the venture has already made its investors rich.
Koop himself sewed up $41 million in Monday's initial public
offering. His fellow director, ``Good Morning America'' teledoc
Nancy Snyderman, took home about $6 million in the IPO. In addition
to his stock windfall, Koop has been pulling down lecture fees,
director's fees, and a six-figure annual consulting payment from
the company, according to its stock filing.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. In return for use of ``his image, name and
likeness in connection with healthcare-related services and
products,'' the company reports, ``we are obligated to pay Dr. C.
Everett Koop a royalty equal to 2 percent of our revenues derived
from sales of our current products and up to 4 percent of our
revenues derived from sales of new products during the term of the
(five-year) agreement.'' Why Koop is so anxious to attach his name
to a Web site that hosts support groups like Angel Power and Beyond
the Locker Room (whatever that means) is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   As surgeon general from 1981 until 1989, Koop made a huge splash
for supporting AIDS research and AIDS patients at a time when many
worried that the Republican administration might turn its back on
them. At the same time, he never backed off from his principled
stand against abortion, alienating the same liberal constituencies
who liked his activist AIDS and antismoking stands.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past decade, Koop seems to have lost his once-perfect
pitch for public politics. His name surfaced in the Clinton
administration's Arlington National Cemetery scandal. Apparently
confusing himself with a real general _ he never served in the
military _ Koop had obtained Clinton's permission in 1994 to be
buried at Arlington. The waiver of Arlington requirements was
especially unusual and was opposed by the Army, because Koop was
still living. After the scandal broke, Koop relinquished his claim
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Koop has tried once before to capitalize on his good name.
Working with television personality Linda Ellerbee, he accepted a
reported $750,000 fee from Time-Warner to roll out a series of $20
videos on consumer health issues. The videos were a bust. According
to The Wall Street Journal, the ill-fated venture burned through
$65 million before declaring bankruptcy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who was traveling and could not be reached for comment,
has a list of professional honors longer than this column. So why
come between the good doctor and what many would regard as his
well-deserved payday? Perhaps just to warn that a reputation is
purchased dear and sold cheaply _ no matter what the price.

AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME 
Directed by: Jay Roach 
Screenplay by: Mike Myers, Michael McCullers 
Starring: Myers, Heather Graham, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Seth
Green, Mindy Sterling, Rob Lowe, Gia Carides, Verne Troyer,
Elizabeth Hurley, Kristen Johnston, Will Ferrell 
Playing at: Copley Place, suburbs 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual innuendo and crude humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in time for the silly season, here comes ``Austin Powers:
The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' It's bigger and slicker than the first
go-round. It's more confident, has more of a sense of what it wants
to be, but remembers never to take itself seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's pretty dumb and vacuous, but it wins you over
anyway. It's still able to seem a big joke, a screenful of bits and
poses sunnily trying to will itself into a movie, and knocking it
is like kicking styrofoam. Mike Myers's toothy airhead is back in
his velvet suit as the Carnaby Street James Bond wannabe, keeping
the world safe for psychedelia and other pop culture artifacts,
including, this time around, a few live artifacts quick to see that
rubbing shoulders with Austin Powers would nudge their coolness
quotients up a few notches.
</P>
<P>
   We're not just talking cameos from the likes of Woody Harrelson
and Willie Nelson. We're talking a duet of Burt Bacharach and Elvis
Costello singing Bacharach's ``I'll Never Fall in Love Again.''
We're talking Tim Robbins, ol' Bob Roberts himself, showing up as a
US president. We're talking about Myers and his colleagues using
the Jerry Springer Show's soul-baring mayhem as much as it uses
them. We're talking about places where casting and sight gags meet,
such as Rob Lowe materializing as the young Robert Wagner character
after Myers's Austin inevitably steps into a psychedelic VW Beetle
time machine and transports himself back to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The '90s sight gags aren't bad, either _ Starbucks's green
letters festooned like mold across Seattle's Space Needle, for
instance. But the '60s rule here, whether in the Playskool-colored
dazzle of Austin's swinging bachelor pad or the way Austin and his
nubile CIA counterpart, Heather Graham's Felicity Shagwell, go
after Myers's alter ego, Dr. Evil, in a yellow submarine. There's a
little too much Dr. Evil, and more than you probably will want from
a third character Myers plays, an obese Scottish hitman and prime
source of crude humor, sporting a name that can't be printed in
this newspaper. The joke is that Dr. Evil is a pussycat who may
talk about world domination, but has all he can do to maintain a
shaky hold on his own dysfunctional family, whose conflicts are
kept bubbling by Mindy Sterling, Seth Green, and the doc's little
clone, Verne Troyer.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and his colleagues know enough to avoid burdening the film
with plot. Nobody will ever accuse this one of being convoluted.
Dr. Evil steals Austin's mojo and Austin needs to get it back to
take advantage of Felicity's willingness to meet him on, so to
speak, equal terms. That's about it.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a big plus, delivers a sly, on-the-money,
tongue-in-cheek take on the deadly macrame-clad CIA beach bunny who
drives a Corvette with a Stars &AMP; Stripes paint job to counterpoint
Austin's Shaguar, with its custom-painted Union Jack. But then the
whole film is as customized as the two sports cars are. It's
Day-Glo bright and kicky, it aims low, and it'll never make you
feel intellectually drained. For once, here's a sequel that hasn't
been buried underneath its increased budget, but has some fun with
it. Give your brain the night off, and Myers will make you smile,
too.

A ROMANTIC EXCURSION IN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maria Ripoll's ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' is a spicy, beguiling
Anglo-Hispanic romantic fantasy that charmingly unfolds in London.
But not in the usual London. It's London transformed from a
battleground into a place of gentle enchantment. It begins on a
mundane level, as two lovers betray one another, part in order to
be with other partners, then experience the urge to reunite, but at
different times. Do they go back and try to regenerate old love? Or
push on to try for new love?
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that sets Ripoli's film apart from most other
romantic comedies, aside from its light touch, is its forgiving
nature. The couple we meet at the outset _ Douglas Henshall's Vic
and Lina Headey's Sylvia _ is mutually unhappy and mutually
unfaithful. Each is seeing somebody else on the side. But the film
isn't out to condemn either. It simply views them as people who
make mistakes. And when Vic gets lucky, it isn't because he's
deserving, but because the law of averages breaks in his favor in a
world that isn't out to get him, and includes a pub whose bartender
(Elizabeth McGovern) may be dispensing magic along with pints of
bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The film also includes a pair of seraphic garbagemen right out
of the pages of Cervantes. When Vic staggers into them one night,
they send him on his way with a gentle nudge and a page out of
``Romeo and Juliet.'' Soon he meets a Spanish muse named Louise
played by a softly radiant Penelope Cruz, who, in her words, helps
him get the rain out of his shoes. By the time the film has
finished making its way through a few alternative realities, which
involve Vic and Sylvia soon leaving the people they originally left
each other for, each must make a choice based on their new mutual
availability.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the film's way of blurring the harsh contours of
romantic breakup and believably offering a vision of emotional
fulfillment that sets it apart from most other couples-in-turmoil
movies. It unflinchingly follows its own romantic impulse toward a
generously humane overview, and while it could easily have landed
on its head, it lands instead on its feet, lightly and with a smile
through its tears. So simpatico and filled with finesse is ``Twice
Upon a Yesterday'' that it's hard to believe that it's a debut
film. But it is, and it casts a spell as Ripoll, with a big assist
from Cruz, brings off her warm and sparklingly inventive romantic
excursion.

J. GEILS BAND IS BACK, AND ROCKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fittingly, the J. Geils Band is jamming in an
unpretentious hideaway rehearsal space in a warehouse. The dead-end
road is potholed. The neighborhood is non-Yuppie. And as you
approach the door, you hear cars thundering overhead on a busy
bridge. It feels like the perfect setting for a ``Bladerunner''
sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, you're embraced by the grind-it-out Geils sound
booming through the walls _ a mixture of R&AMP;B roots, sassy attitude,
and true grit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a blue-collar band,'' says singer Peter Wolf, who
finishes the Geils classic ``Give It to Me'' and joins his
bandmates to discuss the upcoming reunion tour that starts in
Boston June 23. It's the first tour in a staggering 16 years since
the band fell apart due to internal differences that have never
been fully explained and won't be this day, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking forward and not looking back,'' says keyboardist
Seth Justman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even think about whether we should have done this
sooner,'' adds bassist Danny Klein. ``We're doing it now and that's
what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we call him DK the philosopher!'' says Wolf, as the
rest of the group laughs playfully. There are no signs of tension,
no signs of discord, as the group sits down and banters like
long-lost friends in this windowless rehearsal space with no air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last year of the millennium and we're a 20th- century
American band, so here we are,'' says guitarist J. Geils, whose
former apartment in working-class Mission Hill was where the group
first rehearsed in the late '60s, back when Justman brought in a
Hammond B3 organ and Wolf said, ``What's that? It looks like
something from my grandmother's house.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1983, band members toured like madmen. They also
released 15 albums, including such party favorites as ``Full
House,'' ``Bloodshot,'' ``Nightmares (And Other Tales from the
Vinyl Jungle),'' ``Blow Your Face Out,'' ``Sanctuary,'' ``Love
Stinks,'' and ``Freeze-Frame,'' which went to No. 1 in 1981 and
yielded the hits ``Centerfold,'' ``Freeze-Frame,'' and ``Angel in
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   The group peaked with a European stadium tour opening for the
Rolling Stones. Then, bang, they were gone, lost in a muddled sea
of infighting that was described as simply a ``divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a divorce that was costly for fans. At Geils shows, the
sweat would come early _ and it wouldn't stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that marks us as different from many other
bands is the amount of energy we put into a Geils show,'' Wolf
says, peering through his trademark sunglasses. ``There's a
physical commitment to our music which is a lot more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, new Geils drummer Sim Cain is the first to agree. He has
replaced the only original Geils member not to join this tour
(Stephen Jo Bladd, who has elected to stay home with his family).
Cain is used to touring with the hardcore Rollins Band (and played
Woodstock '94 with Rollins), but he admits, ``The first thing that
struck me was how much stamina would be involved in playing with
Geils.''
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed since the Geils clan last strode the boards.
On the band's last official headlining tour, its opening act was
none other than future superstars U2. (For the new tour, Geils has
chosen reggae/ska act Toots &AMP; the Maytals to open.) In the
intervening years, Wolf has made several solo albums, guitarist J.
Geils and harpist Magic Dick have played Chicago blues in clubs
together, Klein has played with Stone Crazy (featuring Babe Pino),
and Justman has worked with Blondie's Deborah Harry and writing
songs for his own project he hopes to unleash one day.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reunite the band have been tried through the years,
but all failed until now. ``There have been various people who
tried,'' says J. Geils. ``But in my opinion, they were trying to
produce too much at once.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they tried to get the group to commit to an
album, a new single, a new video, the works. Then along came John
Baruck, a West Coast manager who has worked with R.E.O. Speedwagon,
and he simply asked them to do a short tour with no strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to this for six weeks,'' says Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right after the tour, we'll be committed to Bridgewater,''
Klein says, referring to a state mental hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The band members took their first baby steps back in January at
a secretive jam session near Boston _ not far from where J. Geils
lives. ``We just took it over for a Saturday afternoon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played `Give It to Me,' `Looking for a Love,' and a couple
of blues,'' Justman says. ``By and large, the sound of the band and
the chemistry of the band re-emerged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like riding a bike. You never forget how to fall off,''
says jokester Klein.
</P>
<P>
   By February they had agreed to a tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Danny says, one drink at a time,'' says Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``But make it a double,'' Klein adds.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the famed Geils Band professionalism has taken over.
Band members may joke on the surface, but underneath they're deadly
serious about reviving the Geils legacy. For the tour, they've
enlisted the backing of the Uptown Horns and two singers, Catherine
Russell and Andrika Hall. Fans can expect songs from all the
albums. No promises are made about writing new material, but that
may come later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're not doing anything different than what Bruce
Springsteen is doing,'' Wolf says of Springsteen's summer reunion
with the E Street Band. ``Like him, we're gathering a fan base that
pre-dates MTV and the pre-changing of a lot of rock radio, back
when each disc jockey was his own programmer and when radio was far
more creative, when disc jockeys played album cuts and weren't
concerned about singles. There's still an audience that can relate
to those bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be it Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, be it Bob Dylan, be it
Paul Simon _ you don't hear Paul Simon on the radio these days, but
a lot of people still find him valid. You don't hear a lot of James
Taylor on the radio, but people still find him a valid artist. The
same with Springsteen,'' says Wolf, adding that the Geils Band once
recorded in the studio next to Springsteen at the Record Plant in
New York when Springsteen cut ``Born to Run.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go see these acts because of the body of work they
created,'' says Wolf. ``It's the same reason we went to see Muddy
Waters when we were starting out. We wanted to hear him do `Hoochie
Coochie Man' and `I Just Want to Make Love to You.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For the past month, the J. Geils Band has rehearsed six to seven
hours a day in this dark rehearsal space. Clearly, this is not a
half-baked reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing a lot of older songs, but we've really improved
all of them, in a way,'' says Magic Dick. ``There's been a
maturation in everyone and the way we rhythmically attack our
instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were going to do it, we wanted to do it right. We're
determined to have a good time out there,'' says Justman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wolf, he has played Geils songs in the last few years
with various touring bands, but now realizes the understandable
limitations of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do these songs with other musicians, it can be good,
but it ain't the real deal,'' Wolf says. ``It's like a mistress on
the side. I've played with a lot of different musicians and some of
them are highly qualified cats from all different styles, but now
I'm back with the people who really created this. This is the real
deal.''

CLUBS AGAIN BECKON DEL FUEGOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Del Fuegos had a decade-plus run as the beloved crazies of
Boston's garage-rock scene. They eventually broke up in the early
'90s, not long after being nominated along with Aerosmith, New Kids
on the Block, Bonnie Raitt, and Bobby Brown for outstanding
pop-rock album at the Boston Music Awards. It was for an album
called ``Smoking in the Fields.'' And the band was not talking
about smoking tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Del Fuegos went far in their day. They rose to
playing arena shows with Tom Petty, ZZ Top, and INXS, but the
Fuegos never felt totally comfortable there, preferring clubs
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those big shows were exciting on paper, but there's an
intimacy that takes place in a club that you can't capture on the
big stage,'' says Del Fuegos guitarist Warren Zanes.
</P>
<P>
   That club intimacy is beckoning again. The Fuegos play a reunion
show at the Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge on Friday night to
benefit a Concord, N.H., soup kitchen operated by the mother of
Warren and his brother, Dan, the lead singer of the Fuegos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is for a good cause and we're eager to see some old
faces,'' says Zanes, whose other bandmates include bassist Tom
Lloyd and drummer Woody Giessmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also eager to get back because our final years were kind
of sloppy,'' says Zanes. ``But everyone gets along well and we're
leaving the ego baggage at the door. For all the moments of
turbulence we had, we still hold dear the moments that it went
right musically.''
</P>
<P>
   Those moments were many. The Fuegos, sporting a bristlingly raw,
garage-rock sound that dipped liberally into rhythm and blues, used
to record for Slash Records _ the label that had such bands as X,
the Blasters, Los Lobos, and the Gun Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``All were bands that we looked up to,'' says Zanes. ``When we
signed to Slash, suddenly we could go where we wanted to. But it's
pretty tricky to be under 25 and have things go your way too much.
That's a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fuegos upheld Boston's honor by naming one of their albums
``Boston, Ma.'' They also enjoyed a national hit with the song

to Hollywood to seek out new opportunities. In those days, it was a
move not appreciated by many ardent Boston rock fans.

   The last Del Fuegos reunion was five years ago at the wedding of
Lloyd's brother, Seth. But group members have generally pursued
separate lives. Now Lloyd has a PhD related to rocket science
(seriously). Dan has a solo career in New York. Giessmann continues
to drum around Boston. And Warren has been living in Los Angeles,
finishing up a PhD in Visual and Culture Studies begun at the
University of Rochester, in New York. He's also signed a record
deal with the Dust Brothers to make a CD that will come out on
Ideal Records, a division of Mammoth Records.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he and the Fuegos are focused strictly on the
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to come back and say, `Hey, we're still just a
four-piece garage band.' That's what we do best,'' says Zanes.

   BOSTON MARRIAGE
</P>
<P>
   Play in three acts written and directed by David Mamet. &QL; 
Set, Sharon Kaitz and J. Michael Griggs. &QL; 
Lighting, John Ambrosone. Costumes, Harriet Voyt. &QL; 
Presented by the American Repertory Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   At: Hasty Pudding Theatre, through June 27.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you assigned students in a playwriting course to create a
drawing-room comedy connecting Oscar Wilde to Harold Pinter and you
got back ``Boston Marriage,'' you'd give it an A and tell all your
friends about the witty new writer you'd discovered in your class.
If, for extra credit, you asked the class to throw in some
playwriting tics from one of today's major American playwrights
you'd go up to an A+.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that the writer of ``Boston Marriage'' is David
Mamet, the expectation is more for a brilliant play than a
brilliant exercise and that expectation is not fully met. The play
is fun, it's smart, and it even adds some insights into Mamet's
work, and for all those reasons it's worth seeing. At Mamet's level
of playwriting, though, the grading curve is steeper and the play,
in its world premiere at the American Repertory Theatre, is closer
to a B-.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious from the start that Mamet is having a ball writing
his version of ``An Ideal Husband,'' or in this case, ``An Ideal
Lesbian Lover.'' A Boston marriage was in fact a term at the turn
of the century, when the play takes place, but the two women,
played by Rebecca Pidgeon and Felicity Huffman, are at each other's
throats with a wit akin to characters out of Wilde and a vengeance
not unlike those from Pinter, Edward Albee, or Mamet himself.
</P>
<P>
   The difference for Mamet is that these characters are females of
the species, whom Mamet has supposedly served poorly through his
career in favor of the machismo-laden. One of the more interesting
aspects of the play is Mamet's ability to dispel that annoying buzz
without writing a condescending play about how women are so much
more sensitive and soulful than his men.
</P>
<P>
   Quite the contrary. These women would give Teach in ``American
Buffalo'' a run for his macho money, considering the epithets they
hurl at each other and at the maid, played by Mary McCann. This
being the turn of the century and every bone of their body
stiffened and corseted, they do it with incredibly proper diction
and comportment, but there's still not that much psychological
distance between Mamet's louts and Mamet's lesbians. Nor should
their amusing man-hating asides be taken as what the playwright
thinks anymore than Teach's tirades at Ruthie be taken as what he
thinks about women. Mamet's characters are equal-opportunity
gratifiers.
</P>
<P>
   In each case it's what's said between the lines and around the
pauses that carry weight. Anna (Huffman) is the mistress of a
wealthy man who has set her up in very tasteful digs (nice, simple
set by Sharon Kaitz and J. Michael Griggs). It's for Claire
(Pidgeon), however, that Anna's knees go weak, so when Claire
declares her love for a younger woman, and asks that Anna provide
housing for them that the two go at it hammer and verbal tong, at
least within the parameters set by their class and gender and the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's interest used to be in what his characters were left
with after they stopped swearing and screaming at each other. Here,
as with his film of ``The Winslow Boy,'' he's more interested in
what is going on underneath that British, or in ``Boston Marriage''
a faux British, reserve: ``I am sorry I was moved to speak with
enthusiasm.'' Their Wilde-isms betray an intellectual shallowness:
``I never could abide learning,'' says one. ``It's a mark of the
social climber,'' agrees the other. And their theater-of-cruelty
accusations and attitudes betray a moral torpor (``Where's the
slavey?'').
</P>
<P>
   One knows, though, where Wilde or Pinter is behind his
characters' bad behavior. Mamet is a bit too elusive here, despite
some well-placed anachronisms from time to time, such as ``Tell it
to the Marines'' or other phrases from his four-letter phrase book.
He also throws in some delicious, Wilde-like plot twists regarding
a necklace. But the play is still lacking a strong authorial point
of view, which is what makes it feel more like an exercise than the
typical Mamet play.
</P>
<P>
   There is a nice balance that Mamet strikes between the women's
prim and proper reserve and the anger and sexuality simmering
beneath it, but these characters are so beyond any redemption that,
unlike ``The Winslow Boy,'' who cares what that reserve is hiding?
Pidgeon and Huffman engage in a bizarre form of Mamet-speak, one
that allows for almost no facial expression. That's obviously what
he wanted, given that he's also the director. They're quite good at
the Thelma-and-Louise-with-parasols poses, and the earthiness and
emotionality of McCann's maid is a welcome counterpoint. I wonder,
though, if ``Boston Marriage'' wouldn't play better with a Wilde-r,
Maggie Smith-like approach to the parts.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, ``Boston Marriage'' continues the strong
relationship between Mamet and ART, although the first,
``Oleanna,'' is still the best. ``Boston Marriage'' is a curiously
entertaining addition to that collaboration, one we hope will
produce the next ``Glengarry Glen Ross.''

A MONSTER IS BORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his fist crashed through the window of our aesthetic
sensibilities, the French writer-director Gaspar Noe splits the
Earth to unleash the hounds of hell foaming at the mouth in one
man's mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he reframes, if not redefines the psychosis of
movie violence in timely apocalyptic fashion. ``I Stand Alone'' has
the ghastly stink of a rotting corpse.
</P>
<P>
   Said devil is actually a butcher (brave Philippe Nahon in an
unnerving double-fisted fit of internal combustion) _ unnamed but
not remotely anonymous and turned inward when the outside world
kisses him off. His misery festers into fuming depression explained
in a series of hard-knock events _ recapitulated in the film's
opening minutes with stills from the film's predecessor, ``Carne.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a comprehensive failure and unwitting societal victim whose
loser status has followed him into middle age. His depression
builds into a molten rage belied by his granite composure, but
elucidated in a bilious Uzi-speed voice-over narration.
</P>
<P>
   What elevates ``I Stand Alone'' from psycho-on-a-rampage
conventionality is the way it refuses to cut its umbilical tie with
the butcher. It doesn't grant him a subjectivity, it is his
subjectivity, hard-wired and jacked-in to the ugly erosion of his
perception, finally becoming a mind-blowing horror film. The
butcher's mental state has the caprice of a land mine: Check out
the gunshots that explode sporadically on the soundtrack when he
zeros in on an unwitting catalyst of his fury. The camera then
sprint-pans in for a jarring close-up on the victim.
</P>
<P>
   In a deft display of ideological craftsmanship, Noe never
reduces his butcher's contempt to the generic proportions of, say,
serial killing. When he pummels his pregnant girlfriend (Frankye
Pain) or uncorks his homophobia on some kid in a bar, something has
provoked him. But the important clarification Noe offers is that
insanity doesn't drive the butcher so much as his wallowing in his
pissed-off state.
</P>
<P>
   He's also middle-aged without having tasted so much as a leaf of
lettuce of his so-called salad days. French films grant much more
credence and respect to the nuance of aging than do American films.
The butcher's lost youth deglamorizes the film's violence,
depriving this man's behavior of the sexy nobility that an
18-year-old thug elicits.
</P>
<P>
   Every year the conversation on cruelty and violence seems to
swell around ``the year's most violent film.'' Last year, the
dogfight between the graphic and the simply gross yielded Todd
Solondz's misunderstood kitsch sitcom ``Happiness'' as the winner.
But year after year, the bar gets raised until violence is the
story, not the force that drives it. ``I Stand Alone'' plays like
Jean-Paul Sartre's ``Taxi Driver'' with the butcher as its Travis
Bickle _ a deranged loner on a self-redemptive quest to rescue a
girl.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the girl is not a hooker but his mentally ill
daughter (Blandine Lenoir, subdued, suggestive), whom he uses like
a holy, incestuous luffa to cleanse his scuzzy guilt. Their reunion
provides the film with its final trenchant sequence _ and Noe's
roiling assertion that monsters aren't born, they're made.

DEFORD CALLS IT AS HE SEES IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's about time someone took a long, hard look at major league
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's Frank Deford talks with Richie Phillips, the umpires'
union leader, and Sandy Alderson, MLB senior vice president of
operations, and basically concludes that upcoming negotiations
between the sides will be nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips tells Deford the commissioner's office has not shown
the umpires ``any respect'' since the last contract. ``Let's see if
they can do without the unimportant people,'' Phillips threatens.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten that bad.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires have become a powerful force. Their incomes and benefits
have increased dramatically since Phillips became union boss in
1978. Back then, an umpire couldn't make more than $40,000 a year.
Now, senior umpires can earn $250,000 a year with an astounding
five weeks of vacation during the 162-game season. More important,
Deford reports, it's virtually impossible to fire an umpire _
regardless of his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks that each umpire has their own strike zone,''
Alderson said. ``People have to believe there is accountability.
You know it's bad when hitters were telling me that they were more
concerned with which umpire was calling their game than the
opposing pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips doesn't want to hear any of it, blasting away at
broadcasters for pointing out badly called pitches and the
commissioner's office for trying to ``shove things down the
umpires' throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is not afraid to blast commissioner Bud Selig for
protecting the interests of the owners at the expense of the game's
overseers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selig walks like an owner,'' Phillips said. ``He talks like an
owner. He acts like an owner. He's slippery like an owner. In fact,
he is an owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's lead baseball analyst, Tim McCarver, was interviewed for
the piece. McCarver, a former catcher, told Deford the strike zone
has definitely changed, that umpires are not calling the high
strikes (the ones below the lettering and at the bellybutton) while
expanding the zone 2 inches off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is accountable,'' McCarver said. ``But whenever
anyone mentions accountability to the umpires, somehow it is
considered to be a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece airs Monday as a segment on ``Real Sports with Bryant
Gumbel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCarver likes what he sees &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of McCarver, he works the Red Sox-Mets game Friday
afternoon. It's still early, but McCarver likes what Jimy Williams
and pitching coach Joe Kerrigan have done with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was saying that trading away Mo Vaughn was a
mistake,'' McCarver said. ``People were saying that Jose Offerman
would never be able to replace Mo's offensive output. Well, they
have.'' He also praised Red Sox management for paying Pedro
Martinez the money. ``He is basically holding up the whole team,''
McCarver said. ``Dan Duquette and John Harrington are looking like
geniuses for hiring Pedro.''
</P>

   NY's Childs has rebounded
</P>
<P>
   NBC has made a name for itself by producing interesting features
on athletes. One of the best aired during halftime of Game 5
Wednesday between the Knicks and Pacers, on Chris Childs. The
report detailed Childs's alcoholism and rehabilitation under John
Lucas. The former Boise State standout said he drank before and
after practices and games during his days in the Continental
Basketball Association. He was out of control until Lucas finally
convinced him that he was not only lying to his friends, but also
to himself. Childs has been sober for six years, and regardless of
his play, hats off to him.

</P>
<P>
   Keith Olbermann hasn't exactly been red-hot since joining Fox
Sports Network. But he did have a funny bit on the possible
reinstatement of Pete Rose during his weekly commentary last week.
``So much Rose `stuff' had made its way into the hands of dealers:
game-used bats, baseballs, gloves, jerseys _ that by 1984 there was
a well-known joke at the card and autograph shows,'' Olbermann
said. ``Collector goes up to a dealer and says, `I want a Pete Rose
game-worn uniform.' Dealer answers, `Phillies, Reds, or Expos?'
Collector says, `Reds.' Dealer says, `Home or away?' Collector
says, `Home.' Dealer looks him in the eye and says, `What size
would you like?' We collectors knew Pete Rose needed money. For
what we did not know.''

   ABC will use the computer-generated first-down marker during

``Monday Night Football'' games this season with Howard David and
Matt Millen working the booth. The deal includes the playoffs, the
Super Bowl, and Sunday night games, starting with the Sept. 12 game
between Cleveland and Pittsburgh at the new Cleveland Stadium. The
Racing Network, the first multichannel, satellite-delivered network
devoted to racing, launches a channel dedicated to greyhound
racing. The programming starts in July and features races from 12
tracks around the country . . . ABC airs the US men's soccer game
against Argentina Sunday, with Bob Ley and Ty Keough. Former
Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Joe Carter joins Sean McDonough to
call first-round action of the College World Series. Florida State
plays Texas A&AMP;M on Saturday at 1:30 p.m. CBS airs the championship
game June 19 at 12:30 p.m.

HAVE BAT, WILL TRAVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brian Daubach's father, Dale, has been walking a
dozen miles a day for years as a letter carrier, delivering mail on
a route so close to home, he can stop in for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least that's how far he says he walks,'' Daubach said with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's driver's ed teacher, Jim Brueggeman, and his wife,
Gail, also a teacher, have organized family vacations around seeing
Daubach play baseball. That's how they've wound up spending time in
such exotic climes as Kingsport, Tenn., Pittsfield, Mass., and Port
St. Lucie, Fla., which is a beach town but not a place you'd want
to go in the dead of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' Brueggeman said, ``you all have been calling him
DAW-back. It's DOW-bock. There are a lot of Germans around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? Call him whatever you want. Just put him in
the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something about going the extra mile that fits for Red
Sox rookie Brian Daubach. After a nine-year odyssey in the minors
that appeared to have run aground last winter, when he was about to
abandon his hopes of playing in the big leagues for a gig in Japan,
Daubach ranks as perhaps the most improbable story line in what
until recently has been a sweet spring for the Red Sox, who will be
trying to end a five-game losing streak when they meet the Mets
Friday night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach comes into the weekend with a .324 batting
average--three percentage points behind team leader Nomar
Garciaparra--six home runs and 20 RBIs in just 102 at-bats--and a
team-best slugging percentage of .637. Judge a hitter on a handful
of games at your own risk -- the game is littered with guys who've
carried a club for a month then faded from memory.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the Belleville Basher, who was the team's 25th man
coming out of camp and was demoted to the minors two weeks later
before being summoned back, has been a Dan Duquette blue-plate
special, a big bang for a cheap buck.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach is no stranger to the Mets, though their fans may be
only vaguely aware of the name. The Mets drafted Daubach nine years
ago, choosing him on the 19th round after being one of the only
teams that showed any interest in him coming out of high school.
Perhaps their scout was there the day Chuck Hasenstab, the baseball
coach at Belleville West High School for the last 33 years, saw
Daubach hit the longest home run he's ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one they still talk about,'' Hasenstab said.
``It's 325 feet down the right-field line here, 365 to the power
alley. Behind that is a huge stand of trees. They've been there for
ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Brian hit one over the trees. Nobody ever saw it come
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention it to Daubach, and he smiles. ``That's still probably
the longest home run I've ever hit,'' he said. ``I got it good. But
remember, I was using an aluminum bat.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in high school, Hasenstab encountered the same problem
that would dog Daubach later in his pro career. ``I really didn't
know where to play him,'' Hasenstab said. ``As a junior, I played
him in right field, but he's not very fast and he didn't have a
particularly strong arm. Then I thought maybe he could play first
base, and he wasn't bad there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Brian wound up choosing his own position. He
wanted to catch. He'd done a lot of catching when he was younger.
But there was never any doubt about his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about his future as a ballplayer, however, came as
quickly as the first winter after he received a $25,000 signing
bonus from the Mets, when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
his knee while playing a game of pickup basketball at home. There
would be three knee operations in the next five years, and after
all of that, Daubach was still in Class A ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to stay around the organization,'' said Daubach,
who was so desperate to retain his fragile hold on a job that he
agreed to be a replacement player in the spring of '95 during the
big-league work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, despite hitting 22 home runs for Double-A
Binghamton and earning a promotion to Triple-A for a cameo
appearance, the Mets let Daubach go. It was Steve Phillips, now the
team's general manager but then in charge of the farm system, who
informed Daubach the club was not putting him on the 40-man
major-league roster, and thus were making him a minor-league free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to give me a major-league invite and I would
sign,'' said Daubach, who had never made it to the Mets' big-league
camp during spring training. ``But they wouldn't give me a
major-league invite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weirdest thing is, the Mets always thought I was a better
player defensively. The Marlins thought I could hit, but they
didn't think I could play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   All Daubach did, in two seasons at Triple-A Charlotte after
signing a minor-league contract with the Marlins, was hit. He
learned how to pull the ball and hit 21 home runs with 93 RBIs his
first season, then trumped that with numbers a Statman would love:
.316 average, 39 home runs, 124 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it took me by surprise when they released me,''
Daubach said. ``They'd seen a lot of me the last couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, in the eyes of one Marlins' official, was a 4-A
player--too good for Triple-A, not quite good enough for the big
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disillusioned when the Marlins released him,''
Brueggeman said. ``He was crushed. I think he was ready to go to
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's other options appeared limited. He'd taken a few
semesters of math classes at St. Louis University. And those
winters where he didn't go to Venezuela or the Dominican Republic
to play ball, he'd come back to Belleville, where he worked in the
Champs sporting goods store.
</P>
<P>
   But then I talked to Brian's dad,'' Brueggeman said, ``and he
told me the Red Sox had signed him. He was pretty excited about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, who had a booster in Sox coach Dave Jauss, his manager
in the Dominican Republic, had a good spring for the Sox in
Florida, hitting .313 with four home runs. That might not have made
any difference if Reggie Jefferson had been healthy, but Jefferson
had a bad back, and Daubach stuck as a left-handed hitter off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   It was with red eyes that Daubach came out of Jimy Williams'
office soon thereafter, told he was being demoted to the minors.
But when Williams moved Jose Offerman from first base to second and
benched Jeff Frye, Daubach was back, and in the lineup, either as
DH or alternating at first with Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   He's played so well, the Brueggemans are already planning their
next summer trip. Baltimore, perhaps, Atlanta or maybe even Tampa.
Big-league destinations, all.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other people would have given up sooner?'' Brueggeman
asked. ``Brian just believed he could do it.''

the 100 best stocks, the 100 best songs, the 100 best Internet Web
sites, the 100 best companies, the 100 best recipes for Spam. ...
It appears that any and every special-interest group and trade
association feels compelled to concoct a 100 best list. No harm in
it; they make for interesting, if often trivial, reading.
</P>
<P>
   One person's best list, of course, is going to contain another
person's losers. Everyone has his or her own standard for
determining what's ``the best.'' After the Modern Library, a
division of Random House, came out with the century's best
English-language novels, it was a sucker's bet that another group
of literati would counter with a different list because the first
wasn't inclusive/discriminating/wide-reaching/focused enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library's selections may be just dandy for people
devoted to the writings of dead white guys, but it didn't appeal to
readers whose tastes in literature run farther afield. No surprise,
then, when the Publishing Triangle this week released its 100
greatest gay and lesbian novels of all time. Publishing Triangle is
an organization of 250 gay and lesbian writers, editors, agents and
publishers, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So why should they be denied their nanosecond in the
end-of-the-century spotlight?
</P>
<P>
   I've never heard of, much less read, about 80 percent of the
books cataloged by Publishing Triangle. But I have read Nos. 13,
43, 64 and 67, and their inclusion on the list made me wonder if
I'd missed an important discussion period in my high school English
Lit class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Budd,'' ``Little Women,'' ``Moby Dick'' and ``To Kill A
Mockingbird'' rated among the best homosexual novels. Had my
school's library contained doctored copies of these literary
classics? Did I miss something in the relationship between Marmee
and Hannah in Louisa May Alcott's tale of a family's triumphs and
tragedies? Was there more to the mysterious Arthur ``Boo'' Radley
in Harper Lee's masterpiece on racism in the South than his
propensity to hide from public view?
</P>
<P>
   Moby Dick ``is'' a gay bar in Dallas, but who knew the
homosexual connection went beyond a wicked double entendre?
</P>
<P>
   ```Moby Dick' is very much about the survival of the
different,'' novelist Dorothy Allison, one of the judges compiling
the Publishing Triangle list, told The Associated Press. ``And
that's pretty much the situation for gay and lesbian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so books could make the list without the story actually
being about homosexuality?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria for what constitutes a `gay novel' were hazy,''
the story said. ``Titles apparently could make the list if the
author was gay, if the book had gay subject matter, or the text was
simply open to gay interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what an interesting way to classify books.
</P>
<P>
   Louisa May Alcott, Herman Melville and Harper Lee _ possibly
homosexual? I had no idea _ probably because the sexuality of these
important American authors didn't matter one iota to the
generations of teachers who placed their works on the must-read
list.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just hope that their inclusion on the Publishing Triangle
list won't lead some narrow-minded homophobe to decide that it's
grounds enough to sweep these classics from the shelves of some
school library in the Bible Belt. Should that occur, one hopes that
the school board will give such a request as much consideration as
it deserves: absolutely none.

 CHICK COREA and ORIGIN: `CHANGE'  
(pr) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no question that Chick Corea's recently formed band,
Origin, has invigorated him; there's so much and so many different
kinds of jazz writing on ``Change,'' his new album, that it sounds
like a competitive young band leader angling for his first precious
shot of attention, rather than a figure who has been well known for
30 years and weathered one conceptual overhaul after another.
</P>
<P>
   His band, Origin _ a New York crew including the saxophonists
Steve Wilson and Bob Sheppard, the bassist Avishai Cohen, the
trombonist Steve Davis and the drummer Jeff Ballard _ is precise,
relentlessly playful with melody and rhythmically alert as it
negotiates the tango, flamenco, blues and splintered-melody mazes.
(One of them, ``L.A. Scenes,'' sounds like a cross between Eric
Dolphy and particularly evocative crime-film soundtrack music.)
</P>
<P>
   The structure of many of the arrangements is staggered: a quiet
pedaled solo piano passage segues into a saxophone-trombone duet
that leads to a line for double-bass and bass clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that the tunes create their own forward motion,
never stalling in the round-robin soloing that bedevils so much
mainstream jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Corea gets his say, though, especially in the trio ballad
``Compassion,'' and in uptempo pieces his fluid, skating lines skid
to a shuddering stop on dark chords. It is smart, exacting music.

ARE REPLACEMENT WINDOWS REALLY BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You have written in the past that regular single-glazed (one
layer of glass) windows with quality storm windows are as good as
double-glazed (two layers of glass) replacement. My son-in-law
feels replacements are better, and wants to replace the windows in
my three-decker at $275 each. I am not convinced. Are replacements
really better?
</P>
<P>
   H. M., Cambridge, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, no, replacements are not (necessarily) better, do not
insulate better than tight, single-glazed inner windows and quality
storms. That has been the handyman's position for some time: If
your doube-hung windows (those that slide up and down) are in good
shape, not rotted or broken, they don't need replacing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two caveats: Old windows must be well
weather-stripped to make them weatherproof and tight in their
frames. The second caveat is that storms should be virtually
airtight, and if storms are old and rickety, they should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   There is more. You said your windows have weights and pulleys
and ropes. That is good, but there is one drawback: You get a
certain loss of heat through the weight pockets because they are
uninsulated and it is not practical to insulate them. The handyman
feels that this heat loss is minor, and is worth tolerating because
such windows never get out of adjustment and are easily fixed if a
rope breaks. They are nothing like a spring-loaded window
(contemporary and replacement double-hung windows are
spring-loaded) which is miserable, sometimes impossible to adjust
or repair if the springs lose tension or break.
</P>
<P>
   So the key is quality. Cheap never works.
</P>
<P>
   The only windows the handyman feels should be replaced are metal
casements because they are impossible to insulate.
</P>
<P>
   Incidently, while replacement windows may save you some heat,
don't expect that savings to pay back the cost of the windows.
Suppose you have 36 windows; at $275 each that comes to $9,900. If
each unit costs $1,000 per season to heat, and the windows save you
10 percent, that is $100 per year per unit, or $300. At that rate,
it would take 33 years to pay for the windows. T'aint worth it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The air coming out of one of the hot air grates is smudging
the ceiling. I tried washing it with Spic and Span and water, but
it smeared. Am I doing something wrong, or is there another product
I can use to clean it?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE OLENIK, North Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are doing nothing wrong, but your technique in cleaning
with the Spic and Span may need improving. Apply the solution to
the stain, and wait one or two minutes, without allowing the
solution to evaporte. This will give the solution time to do its
work in dissolving the dirt. Wipe with a clean, damp sponge.
</P>
<P>
   Then again this might not work anyway. Washing latex ceiling and
wall paint is iffy because the paint is naturally soft. In the good
old days, oil paints, even the flat oil, was hard and easily
washed. My father washed the oil-finished walls and ceilings with
something called Crystal cleaner, and everything came out
beautifully clean; no streaks, smudges.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is another product you can try: a dry sponge called
Wonder Sponge, made by Gonzo, and sold in hardware and building
stores and maybe supermarkets. It is used dry, and should work,
especially against soot and other oily dirt. Another dry sponge is
Professional Soot &AMP; Dirt Remover, made by Bloch/New England,
Worcester, MA 01603. Sold in hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce further staining, have your air ducts cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put outdoor window caps over my windows, pediments
of some kind to dress up the house. Where can I find them, or a
catalog showing ones I could order?
</P>
<P>
   DOTTY HOGAN, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try Fypon of Stewartstown, Pa., makers of plastic foam
components, which look good, stand up to the weather and can be
painted. The choice of caps and pediments is very large. For a
catalog, call Fypon at 717-993-2593.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In my son's new house, the previous owner coated the driveway
to ``Make it look nice.'' It may look OK, but the sealer stuff gets
sticky when it gets warm outdoors. Can he cover it again, or must
he get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   CAROL MASALSKY, Stoughton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I hear it more and more: the ``improvements'' people put slap
dash on their houses before selling, which don't work for long. The
stuff the man used may be motor oil or similar product, not
ncessariy designed as a driveway sealer, which promises to stay
sticky forever. He did you no favors.
</P>
<P>
   I think your son has two choices, other than getting after the
previous owner like ugly on an ape. This first is chancy: Apply a
proper sealer (tar emulsion, Jennite is one brand) over the old and
hope this works. If it doesn't, the driveway is in worse shape than
before. The second choice, more likely to succeed but more work, is
to scrape off that sticky sealer and remove residue, then reseal
with a tar emulsion.

THE FIXED-INCOME EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I understand that the value of fixed-income securities moves
inversely to interest rate changes. As a result, the value of
fixed-income securities has increased sharply over the past few
years, due to the effect of declining interest rates. The trend in
interest rates could very well reverse itself and begin increasing,
causing the value of fixed-income securities to decline. Under
these circumstances, can you explain the rationale to justify
investing in bonds or bond funds at this time to balance an
investment portfolio. Wouldn't it be better to leave the portfolio
unbalanced and take advantage of the rising stock price trend,
rather than move some of the portfolio into fixed-income
investments.
</P>
<P>
   C.A., Needham, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It would be silly to invest in fixed-income instruments and
funds if you KNEW that interest rates will advance and fixed-income
holdings will lose value. But the fact that nobody does know for
certain what will happen in the markets is the reason that people
seek a balanced portfolio, one designed to make the best of any
likely sequence of markets.
</P>
<P>
   The same lack of assurance applies on the stock side. Bear in
mind that when the stock markets take a slide, it can be very deep
and very painful for investors, but when bond markets go sour, it's
usually a matter of 12 to 24 months at most, and the slide is
frequently followed by a substantial recovery. In the last decade,
1994 was the worst year for the fixed-income markets. That year,
the average intermediate-term bond fund showed a 3.78 percent loss
(and it recovered with a 17.37 percent recovery in 1995). Compare
this with what many observers sometimes discuss as a healthy
stock-market correction -- bringing losses in excess of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, I think it's problematic to project that the
fixed-income markets will go into a long slide. Consider the fact
that most economists say we are nearing the end of one of the
longest economic booms in recent history. Once this expansion comes
to an end, it will bring the normal side effects -- lower
employment, a sour stock market, etc. And when the economy is
fading, what do the politicians do in efforts to revive it, or at
least to slow the slide? Why, they cut interest rates, effectively
pumping money into the economy in efforts to create more jobs. For
the owner of bonds, this means rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, consider why most people buy bonds and bond funds. They
buy them first for the yield, which is typically considerably
better than they can do with banks and other absolutely secure
investments. They do it, secondly, because bonds are likely to
supply a steady stream of income, regardless of what the markets
are doing. And, thirdly, they buy bonds because they are convinced
that over the long haul they will be less volatile than stocks,
opting for the relatively steady principal value and the handsome
income stream rather than the prospect for higher but riskier
returns of the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a single man, 41, with all of my money _ approximately
$25,000 _ in a regular savings account. I make $35,000 a year and I
would like to retire at age 62. My friends give their advice
freely, such as buying income property, mutual funds and so forth.
What is your advice as to how to make my money grow to its best
potential?
</P>
<P>
   A.D., Watertown &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A key question is what you view as the purpose of this money.
It appears to be for general savings, kept in the bank to provide a
financial buffer against emergencies, and later to help you to
finance your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   What I suggest you do is determine how much of the money
represents emergency savings, and how much might have been put
aside for a short-term goal, such as buying a car in the next
couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the purposes are, I suggest that you put the emergency
money and savings that you expect to draw upon during the course of
the next five years in a mutual fund company's money market fund.
While these funds are not insured, they invest in extremely safe
assets, such as government notes, loans to banks, and commercial
paper, which is short-term loans to corporations. A typical money
market fund has an average portfolio duration of about 50 days.
With these funds, the value of your investment normally doesn't
change -- shares are always valued at $1 each. But the interest
rate being earned changes daily, very closely tracking interest
rates in general.
</P>
<P>
   While in theory, bad investments might make a money market fund
break the buck, in historical experience none offering shares to
the public ever has, and I view the likelihood of it happening as
minuscule. Almost every major mutual fund family offers one or more
money market funds, and you can expect to get between 4.5 percent
and 5 percent on average in the current markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's suppose you put $5,000 in a money fund. What about
the rest? The big question here is how much risk you can stand.
Most people save for retirement using mutual funds invested in
common stocks, and over a long haul such as the 21 years you have
until your anticipated retirement, it's reasonable to expect that a
diversified stock portfolio will deliver about 10 percent average
annual returns. If that happened in your case, that $20,000 would
grow to $148,023 over the course of the next 21 years, even if you
made no additional contributions. But as it grew, it would also
bring you tax bills based on that growth. For that reason, I
suggest that this year you move $2,000 of that money to a Roth IRA
account, where its will have a tax-free status. Each year, move
another $2,000 to the Roth, and by the time you retire, almost all
of the funds will have tax-free status.
</P>
<P>
   The final big question is how much risk you want to assume. For
people with a normal appetite for risk, I'd suggest all-stock index
funds. If you follow this reasoning, you might put $14,000 into
Vanguard Index 500, a fund which tracks the Standard and Poor's
Index of the nation's 500 leading companies, another $3,000 in
Vanguard Mid-Cap Index fund, which tracks an index of medium-sized
funds, and a similar amount in Vanguard Small-Cap Index fund, which
seeks to track an index of the country's smaller stocks. But before
you make such moves, telephone the company (1-800-662-6273) and ask
for prospectuses for the funds. These will spell out the risks, and
hive you charts showing historical performances; here you can study
what happened in the sour years as well as the sweet ones.
</P>
<P>
   If those sour years make you nervous, you might consider looking
at some more tame fodder -- mutual funds which divide their
investments between stocks and bonds and cash. Solid entries among
the major fund families in these categories are Fidelity Asset
Manager and Fidelity Puritan (my favorite among the four funds
mentioned here), Vanguard Asset Allocation and Vanguard Balanced
Index. A careful study of the prospectuses of these funds should
show you that the risks are lower, but the potential rewards are
lower as well. You'll have to decide what level of risk suits you
and act accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unless you have a strong pension program that you can
rely on in retirement, you should step up your savings level as
much as you can. Remember, the first dollars that go into
retirement savings are the ones which are going to produce the
highest long-term growth.
</P>

   MIAMI _ Despite a U.S. trade embargo, ``Coke Is It!'' in
communist Cuba, which imports the popular soft drink from third
countries. But, in the future, will Coke be the real thing?
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has threatened to manufacture fake
Coca-Cola in retaliation for a recent New York court ruling against
Havana in a fight over the trademark for Havana Club rum, Cuba's
most-prized liquor.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should complain if we start using any North American
brand to produce and commercialize products. Maybe there are some
who say, 'Caramba! Let's taste Cuban Coca-Cola','' Castro pondered
in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   The tug-of-war pits Cuba and its French partner, Pernod Ricard,
against the Bermuda-based liquor giant, Bacardi, both of whom hope
to sell Havana Club rum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, Bacardi's hanging on to the most rope.
</P>
<P>
   Pernod Ricard, which markets the Havana Club brand outside the
United States, sued Bacardi in 1996 after it introduced its own
Havana Club rum here.
</P>
<P>
   But the April court ruling agreed that Bacardi _ and not the
Cuban-French partnership _ should be allowed to market rum under
the Havana Club name because Bacardi had purchased it from the
original owners, a Cuban rum-making family whose properties were
confiscated by Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   And that has Castro seething with anger, and threatening to
limit protection of U.S. trademarks such as Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Baskin, a spokesman for the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co.,
said only that he ``hopes Cuba will abide by trademark rules as we
have always abided by trademark rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. embargo prevents Cuban-made Havana Club rum
from being sold in the United States, it's clear the Cuban-French
partnership is jockeying for a position in a post-embargo era.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and Pernod Ricard, which formed their partnership in 1993,
already hold trademark rights to the Havana Club name in 170 other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Bacardi officials say they formally bought the rights to the
Havana Club name from the Arechabala family in 1997, although ``an
agreement in principle'' was reached as early as 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban-French partnership claims the name was abandoned
by the family, which fled the country after Castro nationalized the
rum industry in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government did legally register the name at the United
States Patent and Trademark Office in 1976 after the family failed
to renew the trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family clearly relinquished its rights to the trademark,''
said Pierre-Marie Chateauneuf, Pernod Ricard's attorney in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He said the judge might have agreed if not for a controversial
law pushed through Congress last year banning U.S. courts from
upholding trademarks that were confiscated, unless the original
holders, or their successors, agree to the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was sponsored by Sen. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and
Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican, both from Florida, at the behest of
Bacardi, which enjoys a major presence in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the measure because it is important to prevent the
illegal confiscation of trademarks,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pernod Ricard, which plans to appeal the New York court
ruling, argues that the law is illegal and prejudiced, and has
urged the European Union to file a complaint with the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Such a complaint would fan the flames of an even bigger showdown
between Europe and the United States, already embroiled in a trade
war over bananas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this law was a piece of self-interest legislation
conceived by Bacardi's attorneys,'' Chateauneuf said.
</P>
<P>
   But Doug Gibson, vice president and general counsel for Bacardi,
said the law simply codifies the principles of international law
that say foreign confiscations can't be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, many U.S. companies are worried that Havana may
stop honoring their trademarks, meaning a Cuban or any foreign
company could take the names of U.S. products and make them their
own in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 U.S. companies have registered trademarks in Cuba,
which include Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Calvin Klein, and the Hard Rock
Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically Cuba has been protective of intellectual
property, but now I believe that companies, especially those that
have yet to register their trademarks, may have reason to be
concerned,'' said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade
and Economic Council, a New York-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Castro chastised the United States for its
``bald-faced violation of international law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope no one complains if one day we begin to produce
Coca-Cola,'' he said. ``We might be able to make it better, and on
the can we'll put: Cuban Coca-Cola.''

 &HT;    Chickenpox vaccine message gets through
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It used to be that Dr. Karen Dewling had to persuade
parents to give the chickenpox vaccine a try. But in the past six
months she has seen a dramatic turnaround, with mothers and fathers
asking for the shots for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have really caught on to the fact that this is a good
disease to prevent,'' said Dewling, a pediatrician at the Emory
Clinic North in Duluth, Ga.. ``A lot more parents are getting the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   To make sure the trend continues, a Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention advisory committee has just issued new
recommendations about the chickenpox vaccine. The Committee on
Immunization Practices wants all children entering day care centers
or elementary school to receive immunization against chickenpox,
officially known as varicella, along with polio and measles
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, only about one in every four children is vaccinated
against the disease, a figure that puts the state just below the
national average for chickenpox shots, according to the CDC. But
that number could increase dramatically by the 2000-2001 school
year. That's because several groups, including the state's
pediatricians, are pushing the Georgia Department of Human
Resources to change the state's guidelines and be in compliance
with the federal recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   It would take several steps, however, to make the chickenpox
vaccine mandatory in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Department of Human Resources board would have to
propose new regulations and air them at a public hearing, according
to Barbara Joy, a spokeswoman for the agency. If no revisions were
suggested, the board would have to take a vote. If the measure
passed, the guidelines could become a reality. But the process of
getting doctors' offices, public health departments and schools
ready for the new guidelines could take at least four months.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 10 states and the cities of Washington and San
Antonio require that children receive chickenpox vaccinations. Five
other states are considering similar regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The new interest in making the vaccine mandatory arises because
scientists are more comfortable with the safety of chickenpox
immunization. Since 1995, more than 16 million doses have been
administered, according to Merck &AMP; Co., which manufactures the
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   ``School and child care requirements are an effective strategy
in increasing vaccine coverage,'' said Jane Seward, chief of
varicella activity at the CDC's national immunization program.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations could also help the government meet its
Healthy People 2010 chickenpox goals of vaccinating more than 90
percent of children by age 2 and more than 95 percent of children
entering school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Implementing (such) requirements will be the most effective
way to achieve these goals _ as it has been for other childhood
vaccines,'' Seward said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, between 50 and 100 children die of chickenpox every
year, and more than 5,000 hospital admissions are attributed to the
illness. One in every 49 people who contracts it experiences
serious complications, such as skin infections, pneumonia or
central nervous system infections.
</P>
<P>
   But Dewling said that when the vaccine was first released in
1995, many people were suspicious of its benefits and concerned
about possible side effects. Some parents worried that the immunity
will decrease over time, making adults more vulnerable to
chickenpox than they would have been as children. Adults have a
much higher risk of complications if they contract chickenpox,
although Japanese studies have indicated that the vaccine is
protective for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dewling said many of those fears have been allayed by more solid
data about the shots' safety. ``I think you'll find gradual
acceptance as many of these issues are put to rest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, doctors say, the vaccine should be administered to
children between 12 and 18 months old and again when they are 13
years old. The immunization has been shown to prevent 95 percent of
serious chickenpox cases, although some children will still get the
disease _ in a much milder form.
</P>
<P>
   Chickenpox is a virus spread through the air and by direct
contact with skin lesions. The incubation time is 11 to 21 days,
and the disease is contagious from one to two days before a rash
appears until four days after a rash occurs. The majority of cases
happen in the winter and spring, with 90 percent of those affected
being younger than 10.

HOW GENDER MAY INFLUENCE OUR RELATIONS WITH ANIMALS

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Does your dog keep better track of your hormonal
cycles than you do? Why do women outnumber men at animal rights
gatherings by a ratio of 3 or 4 to 1? Why is it usually men who are
responsible for violent animal cruelty? Is the woman in a household
closer emotionally to the family pet than the man is? Do the health
benefits of owning a pet apply equally to men and women? And do
canine characters hold the key to understanding ``Wuthering
Heights''?
</P>
<P>
   These were a few of the eclectic questions asked and discussed
at a conference last week at the Veterinary Hospital of the
University of Pennsylvania, a gathering run by James Serpell,
director of the Center for the Interactions for Animals and
Society, and author of ``In the Company of Animals'' (Cambridge
University Press).

<P>
   ``Men, Women, and Animals: The Influence of Gender on Our
Relations with Animals and Nature'' may not have answered all the
questions posed, but it pointed out how much we have to learn about
how gender affects our relationships with wildlife and pets.
</P>
<P>
   Academics, scholars, animal welfare experts, social workers, and
veterinarians gathered to hash out notions of how men and women see
the natural world in different ways, and further how animals
perceive us differently according to gender.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing talks came from Dr. Myrna Milani of
Charlestown, N.H. A veterinarian specializing in behavioral issues,
she says 98 percent of her practice is dedicated to problems of
aggression. She has been sniffing out the influence of biochemical
signals and body language, and has paid attention to phenomena that
other behaviorists have observed: Some dogs grow protective of
female owners at the onset of pregnancy; and certain dogs will
become aggressive toward boys who are going through puberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Female owners of aggressive male dogs,'' Milani says, ``report
that their pets appear more aggressive toward them during the
period preceding their menses and during the menses itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Milani believes that humans often unintentionally give off
biochemical cues (such as through natural pheromones) and
behavioral signals (for instance, sitting on the floor while your
dog is on the couch cedes status to the animal) that may make an
aggressive dog moreso.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of scientific inquiry is required to puzzle and
plot this all out, but Milani believes that leadership qualities
can be conveyed in the wild _ and at home _ through chemical
signals. ``Certainly, observations of leader dogs and studies of
successful men strongly suggest that testosterone or, more likely,
some pheromonal component of it, communicates leadership,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict and harmony between man or woman and beast dominated
other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Lockwood of the Humane Society of the United States
discussed animal cruelty. He pointed out that 90 percent of
homicides in this country are committed by men, so it was no
surprise that men are responsible for the vast majority of animal
cruelty cases. In his study of newspaper clippings over two years,
males accounted for all cases of mutilations, draggings, and
poisonings.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockwood doesn't think that harming animals is an
exclusively male occupation. He points to the strange phenomenon of
``animal collecting,'' in which a person hoards animals in filthy
and unhealthy conditions. Women accounted for slightly more than
half of these kinds of abuse cases in his study. And furthermore,
Lockwood discussed a rare but odd disorder that is the pet owner's
version of Munchausen by Proxy, in which an owner will
intentionally make a pet sick in order to nurture it back to
health.
</P>
<P>
   Well, how about looking for a little harmony between owners and
pets? Susan Phillips Cohen conducted a survey to sort out how men
and women differ in their intimacy with pets. She found from
working at the huge Animal Medical Center in New York City that
just about all clients coming in described their pets as ``a member
of the family.'' But what do they mean by that? Cohen randomly
selected 201 clients to fill out questionnaires, which measured
intimacy, psychological kinship, and bond with pets.
</P>
<P>
   She found big differences between men and women. Women felt
``significantly'' more intimacy with the closest pet than the
closest person in their lives. And they had fewer problems with
pets than men did. Responding to questions about how animals are
different from us, men tended to point out things pets cannot do,
like talk. Women tended to concentrate on how pets are better than
people, as in ``my dog never needs his space.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Herzog, a professor at Western Carolina University in
North Carolina, studied why women dominate the scenes at animal
rights demonstrations. Looking over various studies, Herzog pointed
out that women are more likely than men to attribute mental states
to other species, to feel that animal research is morally wrong,
and to believe that animals should have rights. ``Indeed,'' he
says, ``gender has consistently been found to be the single most
important factor in predicting attitudes toward animal welfare
issues.'' Just why is open to debate: Is it socialization?
Differing approaches to relationships? A feeling of shared
oppression? Is Darwinian psychology at work?
</P>
<P>
   Another big mystery is whether men and women differ in the
health benefits of pet ownership. Though there have been studies
over the years tracking how pet ownership can help decrease blood
pressure and anxiety and increase longevity in certain patients,
none indicates gender differences. Erika Friedmann, a professor at
Brooklyn College of City University of New York, discovered that
many of the long-term studies focused on men, and many of the
short-term studies involved premenopausal women. Many studies do
not even identify the sex of the subjects. All people do not
benefit equally from pets, Friedmann concludes, and future studies
should take care to identify gender, race, and ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Emily Bronte and dogs? Many of us in the audience had
forgotten just how central dogs are to the action in ``Wuthering
Heights.'' From nursing curs to pampered spaniels, dogs illuminate
Bronte's thoughts about human nature and wild impulses versus the
comfort of the hearth. Dogs are a ``threshold species,'' according
to Maureen Adams of the University of San Francisco, standing
between two worlds in a book that crosses many boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seems right that there were more questions than
answers at the conference. We are ourselves at the threshold of
exploring our own nature in relation to animals. For now, maybe all
we can say is that men are from Mars, women are from Venus _ and
dogs are from Pluto.

ARMADILLOS NOT SEEN AS FOOD THREAT 
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ People who eat armadillos are unlikely to
contract leprosy as long as the meat had been either frozen or
cooked, the San Francisco Health Department officials told members
of the Animal Control and Welfare Commission in response to
concerns about the animals and the disfiguring disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless somebody's scarfing up road kill, they shouldn't come
upon that problem,'' said Ben Gale, the department's director of
Environmental Health.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, armadillos could be removed from the list of
animals that are legally sold in the city as food, commission
chairman Richard Schulke said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale told commissioners that his health inspectors were able to
identify one Oklahoma company that supplies armadillos to Chinatown
merchants and discovered that the company did not have permits to
sell them. The Health Department has asked the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to look into sanctions against the company, Sooner
Aquatics, Gale said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale said health inspectors recently found four armadillos in
two stores in Chinatown, but employees at the stores were unable to
identify from whom they received the shipment. The frozen
armadillos were impounded and will be disposed of unless the
dealers are properly licensed, Gale said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale emphasized that it is legal to sell armadillos for
consumption, but they must be supplied by businesses with permits.
</P>
<P>
   Gale said that even though as many as 15 percent of armadillos
found in the South have leprosy, humans do not run the risk of
contracting the disease if the animal has been frozen or cooked
properly.

AN IRREVERENT `AUSTIN POWERS' STRIKES AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' insults fat people. It
insults little people. It insults Scots, Arabs, Germans, lesbians
and the LPGA tour. It is sophomoric, scatological, brazenly
derivative, anatomically obsessed and contributes no major insights
into the human condition.
</P>
<P>
   But it's funny. Extremely funny. Funny in a relentless, cheesy,
bonks you-over-the-head with-stupid-jokes sort of way, like
spending an afternoon with a geeky cousin who won't stop cracking
puns.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jay Roach with the same cartoon splashiness that
marked the first film, ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is both puerile
and charming, a terrifically amusing follow-up to what has become a
cult hit.
</P>
<P>
   The original, for those of you who don't have a teen-age boy
lurking somewhere, starred Mike Myers as a vintage-1960s,
cryogenically preserved British agent with cruddy teeth, groovy
velvet suits and a taste for shagging. The sequel marks the
reappearance of both Austin Powers and his world-dominating
archnemesis, the nefarious Dr. Evil (also Myers), last seen
floating through space in a Big Boy statue.
</P>
<P>
   The new film begins with Dr. Evil's return to Earth, where he
reconvenes with his yes-men the loyal Number Two (Robert Wagner),
the stern Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), the cat Mr.
Bigglesworth and meets his new clone, Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer),
who is one-eighth the size of the original. He also reunites with
his slacker son, Scott (Seth Green) popping up for a surprise visit
on ``Jerry Springer'' (an episode titled ``My Father Is Evil and
Wants to Take Over the World!'').
</P>
<P>
   So fortified, Dr. Evil hatches a plan to go back to the late
1960s via a time machine and steal Austin Powers' mojo (i.e., ``the
libido, the life force, the essence'') from his cryogenic chamber
the idea being, of course, that if Austin is minus his mojo, he
won't be able to defeat Dr. Evil's latest plan for world
domination.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is robbed of his mojo, which turns out to be red Jell-O
streaked with small squiggly objects. Doing the ugly deed is Fat
Bastard, with Myers again, in prosthetic flab _ an obese Scottish
operative who weighs a metric ton and provides 99.9 percent of the
movie's bathroom humor. Austin immediately senses his mojo is
missing. So he hops into his own time machine (actually a New
Beetle with a snazzy paint job) and zooms back to the era of lava
lamps, where the plot goes off in ever more convoluted directions.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Austin's escapades bring him into contact
with a variety of femmes, among them a looming Russian named Ivana
Humpalot (Kristen Johnston) and a CIA agent in hot pants named
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham). If the cast has a weak point,
it's Graham: Someone forgot to tell her to ham it up. The wide-eyed
fawn routine is no substitute for campy overacting, which everyone
else in the film seems to grasp. Otherwise, ``The Spy Who Shagged
Me'' is good, dopey fun.
</P>
<P>
   The first ``Austin Powers'' spoofed James Bond flicks, but this
one spoofs everything _ Will Smith videos, prog rock,
``Independence Day.'' ``Star Wars'' gets hit repeatedly, from its
pre-credits opening scroll to the Death Star. Even Robert Wagner
himself gets tweaked, in a freakishly accurate imitation by Rob
Lowe as a young Number Two. The film is stuffed with cameos,
including Burt Bacharach, Elvis Costello and Tim Robbins, a few of
them strung together in a marvelous pastiche of bad-taste genitalia
humor that cannot be described here.
</P>
<P>
   What can be described is the movie's opening credits, in which
Austin cavorts nude through a chi-chi hotel, his unmentionables
hidden by props. If nothing else, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' features some of the giddiest product placements ever
committed to film.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we get shots of Dr. Evil wiping cappuccino foam from
his nose at his HQ in Seattle. It seems to be the Space Needle.
And, like everything else in Western civilization, it has been
converted to a Starbucks.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In a moral universe full of shadows and grief, I have been an
American correspondent working in a country at war with America.
 &HT;    Of course, it is the NATO alliance that has been formally
attacking Yugoslavia, but no one, Serb or Albanian, believed that
this was anything but Washington's war.
 &HT;    My most searing memory is not of physical horror _ of the
charred corpses from a bombed passenger train, or the severed head
near a rocketed column of Albanian refugees. All that comes with
war in the Balkans, when history and high explosives collide.
 &HT;    What will stay with me longest is the memory of two large
bearded Serbian men, hours apart, weeping uncontrollably in my
arms, the arms of the aggressor, over the deaths of their friends
from an American missile. Their friends, a technician and a makeup
artist, died in the April 23 attack on Radio Television Serbia
headquarters in Belgrade. They were not even the people who made
the programs, which NATO had decided, in its infinite capacity for
misunderstanding this country, were the propaganda that fed Serbian
resistance and which remained on the air in any case.
 &HT;    Neither man expected me to apologize for the attack, which I
would not and could not do. In a sense, I think, they were weeping
not only for their friends, but also for the death of their own
misconceptions of America. What began as a campaign against the
Yugoslav military, to get Slobodan Milosevic to capitulate quickly
over Kosovo, veered, perhaps out of frustration, into a psy-ops war
aimed also at civilians, at their electricity and their water and
their heating plants. A month into the war, no Serb believed that
the bombs were not aimed at them, or that NATO hit anything _ even
hospitals or the Chinese Embassy _ by error.
 &HT;    So I have been slapped by an old lady and hit by a man, both
offended at hearing English, and I have simply walked away. I have
heard Serbian policemen, at a scene of bombing devastation in
Aleksinac, when Western reporters joked to inure themselves to the
bloody human remains on which they were unavoidably stepping, say,
``Listen to the bastards, speaking English and laughing.''
 &HT;    I have been yelled at by drunks and waylaid at parties, with
normally polite people lecturing me about the tortured history of
Kosovo and demanding that I defend the half-truths uttered by the
NATO spokesman, Jamie P. Shea.
 &HT;    Sometimes, full of resentment, I did defend Shea, even when I
knew from my reporting that some of what he said was wrong. Because
not to do so was to accept the grotesque moral equivalency _ both
sides lie, we're victims just as much as the Albanians _ in which
too many Serbs want to wallow. And sometimes, also full of
resentment, I've taken pleasure at telling particularly smug Serbs
just what their forces have done, in their name, to the ethnic
Albanians of Kosovo.
 &HT;    We journalists think we are all so charming and self-evidently
objective. But even the waitresses who have brought me coffee for
weeks, when there was electricity to make it, could barely disguise
their disgust with us, the vultures of war, whom they have served
in a hotel that got priority for electricity as if it were a
hospital. I could tell the mornings when NATO's bombs have kept
their kids up all night, with only a flashlight to keep away the
dark, and the mornings when there was no running water. They would
tell me that they were angry with me as an American, another odd
form of trust, and yet they wanted to know what I'd discovered,
whether it reflected well on their country or not.
 &HT;    As for what I think, well, that's a different matter. I do not
tell them or anyone, not completely. My job is to find out what
they think, and how they live and manage, and to try to present
them as real, and not as caricatures from some movie about American
good and Nazi evil.
 &HT;    Of course from Washington's point of view, and in sharp contrast
to its rhetoric about the Balkan Hitler, this has scarcely been a
war at all; it has been more like a police action from the sky.
Here I feel some shame. Looked at from beneath the bombs, NATO's
conduct can seem cowardly. The Serbs knew they were powerless to
prevent NATO from doing what it pleased, but they have been
insulted by the invisibility of the enemy. They sense that it is a
way of pretending that their lives are expendable, the ``collateral
damage'' of NATO's desperate effort to retain credibility in a
mismanaged war. But many Serbs also know that what their forces
have done to the Albanians of Kosovo is horrible, and few have much
love for Milosevic. Many would be happy to see him gone, or on
trial, or hanged.
 &HT;    Perhaps soon, some will try again to depose him.
 &HT;    But I think the Serbs, however misled, have a right to their
patriotism, and to their own national myths, and to their grief.
All this must be reported; their grief, at least, I have shared.

peace. Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and the other leaders of the West
thought it could be otherwise. They launched the first war in
history said to be in pursuit of principle, not interest.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was that they had never intended to do more than
drop a few bombs. Then, when a few bombs proved inadequate, they
found they had stumbled into a war they did not mean to fight, had
not prepared to fight and were not willing to fight, at least with
men who might get killed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the stuff of nobility. The Kosovo war turned out, as
wars generally do, a mess. The peace, if that is what the deal
finally signed on June 9 brings, looks little better.
</P>
<P>
   The first shortcoming is that the West, whatever its
protestations, has not won a clear-cut victory. It resorted to
force, remember, to make Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
accept the terms he had rejected at the French chateau of
Rambouillet in February.
</P>
<P>
   He had balked in particular at two conditions: that NATO should
have the free run not just of Kosovo, but of all of Serbia, and
that within three years the Kosovars should have the chance of
voting for independence.
</P>
<P>
   These may have been foolish conditions to try to impose on
Serbia; had the West never set them, it might not have mattered
much that they have now been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   However, they were set, and their abandonment means Milosevic
may legitimately claim at least a partial vindication of his
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO's victory lacks shine, however, it is because of the
cost at which it has come and, above all, the distribution of that
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The death figures tell their own tale: allied servicemen, nil;
Serb soldiers, perhaps 6,000; Serb civilians, perhaps 2,000;
Kosovars, perhaps 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   To these must be added the wounded and the refugees: 600,000
displaced within Kosovo, 800,000 driven out. Many of those will
never return home, if only because they now have no home to return
to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the blame for most of these deaths and displacements
lies with Milosevic, not NATO. But not for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the genuine mistakes, any dispassionate accounting of
the conflict is almost certain to find the allies guilty of some
terrible crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Even the elegant trituration of targets in Serbia, the
destruction of bridges, the incapacitation of power stations,
however necessary in war, when carried out night after night from
the safety of the skies seemed to turn the bombing into a horrible
high-tech coconut shy.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest reason for questioning the nature of the allies'
triumph, however, was its central failure: this was a war to stop
ethnic cleansing, but the main effect was to intensify it.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign accelerated the killing _ to more than
2,000-3,000 people had died in the province before the bombing
began, quite a few at the hands of Kosovar guerrillas _ and it
accelerated the emptying of the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   In humanitarian terms, the Kosovo campaign turned into a
disaster. Whether that disaster can now be mitigated may depend on
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his claims of victory, for the Serb people as a whole
the war has been a catastrophe. If they can get rid of him,
establish a democracy and settle down to live in peace with their
neighbors, then the prospects not just in Kosovo but in the region
as a whole look much brighter.
</P>
<P>
   None of that, though, is certain. For the moment, at least,
Milosevic is still in charge, still in a position to frustrate
progress towards peace and, because he is now officially wanted for
war crimes, still with a motive to defy the West.
</P>
<P>
   How nice if someone could nab him and have him put on trial.
Unfortunately, the allies' apparently opportunistic release of
evidence about him that made his indictment possible has also made
the war-crimes tribunal seem less than independent. That could be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting peace will be even harder to establish in the Balkans
without an unambiguously impartial court that can bring the
region's many war criminals to book.
</P>
<P>
   A compromised court, however, is not the only difficulty ahead
for the allies. To the costs of reconstruction and resettlement
must be added the cost of garrisoning this new corner of
ex-Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is already a protectorate in all but name, and likely to
remain so for many years. Kosovo will be in NATO's hands for just
as long. Serbia itself is likely to stay turbulent, its hard-liners
truculent.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the dropping of more explosives than in any other 11
weeks in history, the Serb army remains potent: relatively few of
its men have been killed, a formidable proportion of its armor,
artillery and mobile air-defense systems is still intact.
</P>
<P>
   Though this may be consistent with Clinton's avowed aim of
reducing Serbia's ability to attack Kosovo's civilians, it is not
impressive. The main job will lie with the incoming peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, as some are claiming, has the bombing opened a new chapter
in the history of warfare by showing that air power alone can
produce victory.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last two weeks of the fighting, when the kamikaze
tactics of the Kosovar guerrillas flushed the Serbs' armor into the
open and rendered it vulnerable to NATO's strikes, the infamous
Serb army had escaped serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kosovo is now inviolate, Serb troops could still be
used, say, to suppress Montenegro, the last Yugoslav republic still
yoked to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   One day, several years off, a grand conference of interested
parties may be able to redraw the map of the Balkans with the
consent of its people.
</P>
<P>
   The hope will be that by then the West will have tied the
now-volatile countries of the region to its clubs _ the European
Union, NATO and so on _ and made them at least see the merits of
good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   With generosity, luck and a fair wind, that might reduce the
volatility, but it would be foolish to imagine that ancient
animosities will by then be entirely dead, or that recent upheavals
will be forgotten. Many of the refugees of the 1990s will still be
displaced. More transfers of population will probably have to
follow, peacefully, it must be hoped.
</P>
<P>
   And has the Kosovo war made even a distant settlement more
likely? Yes, despite the awful cost, if only because such a
settlement would have been less likely had Milosevic been allowed
to expel the Kosovars without any resistance from the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   That he would have tried to do so seems almost certain: fully
35,000 people, maybe more, had already fled the province in the
months before the bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   The West could surely not have just turned its back on such an
outrage. But it could have shown itself ready to drive the Serbs
back by fighting on the ground as well as from the air.
</P>
<P>
   If it now confronts a messy war and a messy peace, it is largely
because it resorted to force with such inadequate preparation. &QL;

<P>
   Most workers today have had a pay raise every year of their
working life _ and most assume they always will.
</P>
<P>
   But contrast this with a century ago. In 1900 the average weekly
wage of an American worker was $9.30 a week, exactly what it had
been 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The result of ruthless capitalists exploiting defenseless
workers? No, for this happened at a time of falling prices: real
wages actually rose by almost 40 percent over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Before the First World War, prices and wages seldom rose
continuously; instead they were broadly stable over long periods.
The annual pay raise is an invention of the late 1950s, when
inflation first became persistent.
</P>
<P>
   With prices stable or falling in many industries in many
countries, that invention is looking stale.
</P>
<P>
   In macroeconomic terms, many rich industrial economies are
within sight of price stability. The average rate of consumer-price
inflation in the G7 economies is running at 1 percent, its lowest
for half a century. And central banks seem determined to keep it
there.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's inflation is higher than most, and America may also be
an exception: there are hints that inflation there may be reviving.
But the Federal Reserve will almost certainly raise rates soon to
put the lid back on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most important changes are those affecting individual
industries and companies. Even if general inflation revives or
remains positive, prices are falling in some industries.
</P>
<P>
   This is forcing managers who have been reared on decades of
inflation to rethink some of their old ways of doing business. In
particular, the case for a general annual pay raise, tied to
consumer-price inflation, is vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   A periodic pay review is welcomed by many managers: it is easier
than an ad hoc approach, and is less liable to cause conflict and
jealousy. But there is no reason why it should be annual,
especially in industries where prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees feel differently. Trade unions in particular
might feel undermined. Moreover, people like an annual pay raise
even if it provides no real gain. In other words, they suffer from
money illusion.
</P>
<P>
   When inflation was 10 percent, people felt good about getting a
10 percent pay raise; in hard times they might even have accepted a
7 percent raise _ a 3 percent cut in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   But when inflation is close to zero, a pay freeze is regarded as
an insult, even if it leaves living standards unchanged. And since
it is hard to cut nominal wage rates, price stability could put a
floor beneath real wages.
</P>
<P>
   There is thus a risk that price stability may make relative
wages even more rigid. This is why some economists argue that a
little bit of inflation, say 3 percent, is a useful lubricant for
relative wage adjustment, because it makes it easier to disguise
real wage cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is a dangerous argument: the past three decades have
shown that a little bit of inflation, just like a little drink, can
easily get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution is to make wages more flexible _ down as well
as up. This requires not only reconsidering the negotiation of
annual pay raises; it also suggests linking a bigger share of pay
to profits or individual performance.
</P>
<P>
   The wage bill would then fall automatically in hard times. That
would mean lower take-home pay _ but most people would surely
prefer that to losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More variable pay might also increase the incentive for
employees to raise their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, a pay raise was a special event _ the result of
promotion or a reward for individual merit _ and not an automatic
annual expectation. Since then, annual pay negotiations have not
only served to keep inflation going; they have also sometimes
obscured the signals that link effort to reward.
</P>
<P>
   Central bankers may argue, entirely correctly, that inflation is
bad for the economy and for growth. Yet employees (and often their
employers, too) are rather fond of it.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, as J. K. Galbraith once said, rescues firms from the
errors of optimism and stupidity. It is time that bosses and
workers learned the advantages of living without it. &QL;

there.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's inflation is higher than most, and America may also be
an exception: there are hints that inflation there may be reviving.
But the Federal Reserve will almost certainly raise rates soon to
put the lid back on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most important changes are those affecting individual
industries and companies. Even if general inflation revives or
remains positive, prices are falling in some industries.
</P>
<P>
   This is forcing managers who have been reared on decades of
inflation to rethink some of their old ways of doing business. In
particular, the case for a general annual pay raise, tied to
consumer-price inflation, is vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   A periodic pay review is welcomed by many managers: it is easier
than an ad hoc approach, and is less liable to cause conflict and
jealousy. But there is no reason why it should be annual,
especially in industries where prices are falling.
</P>
<P>
   Many employees feel differently. Trade unions in particular
might feel undermined. Moreover, people like an annual pay raise
even if it provides no real gain. In other words, they suffer from
money illusion.
</P>
<P>
   When inflation was 10 percent, people felt good about getting a
10 percent pay raise; in hard times they might even have accepted a
7 percent raise _ a 3 percent cut in real terms.
</P>
<P>
   But when inflation is close to zero, a pay freeze is regarded as
an insult, even if it leaves living standards unchanged. And since
it is hard to cut nominal wage rates, price stability could put a
floor beneath real wages.
</P>
<P>
   There is thus a risk that price stability may make relative
wages even more rigid. This is why some economists argue that a
little bit of inflation, say 3 percent, is a useful lubricant for
relative wage adjustment, because it makes it easier to disguise
real wage cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is a dangerous argument: the past three decades have
shown that a little bit of inflation, just like a little drink, can
easily get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   A better solution is to make wages more flexible _ down as well
as up. This requires not only reconsidering the negotiation of
annual pay raises; it also suggests linking a bigger share of pay
to profits or individual performance.
</P>
<P>
   The wage bill would then fall automatically in hard times. That
would mean lower take-home pay _ but most people would surely
prefer that to losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More variable pay might also increase the incentive for
employees to raise their productivity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, a pay raise was a special event _ the result of
promotion or a reward for individual merit _ and not an automatic
annual expectation. Since then, annual pay negotiations have not
only served to keep inflation going; they have also sometimes
obscured the signals that link effort to reward.
</P>
<P>
   Central bankers may argue, entirely correctly, that inflation is
bad for the economy and for growth. Yet employees (and often their
employers, too) are rather fond of it.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, as J. K. Galbraith once said, rescues firms from the
errors of optimism and stupidity. It is time that bosses and
workers learned the advantages of living without it. &QL;

   The more paranoid Arab commentators insist that NATO's war with
Yugoslavia is designed to distract attention from America's war
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo may have pushed Iraq out of the headlines but, for
policymakers in Washington, diplomats at the United Nations and
American and British pilots patrolling the skies over northern and
southern Iraq, the battle continues, as fiercely and inconclusively
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   And the plight of ordinary Iraqis worsens by the day.
</P>
<P>
   Since a four-day bombing blitz last December, the U.N. Security
Council has been split over Iraq. Inspectors from UNSCOM, the U.N.
body charged with disarming Iraq, decamped to Bahrain to sit out
the bombardment, and have not been allowed back.
</P>
<P>
   All the veto-wielding members of the council agree that some
sort of arms-control regime must resume to winkle out Iraq's
remaining biological and chemical weapons. But they disagree over
what concessions to make to Iraq in return.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and France argue that the oil embargo should be
suspended when Iraq allows inspectors to return. A British and
Dutch proposal, backed by America, stipulates a four-month waiting
period to ensure compliance with a new inspection regime.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis say they have no more banned weapons, and demand an
unconditional end to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   A special U.N. panel was convened in March to find a way out of
this deadlock, but it failed. A recent French proposal supposedly
blended the Anglo-Dutch and Russian schemes, but ended up pleasing
no one _ least of all the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Even the relatively simple matter of sending a team to dismantle
UNSCOM's abandoned laboratory in Baghdad caused a kerfuffle in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   With Kosovo taking center-stage, there is little diplomatic
capital to expend on Iraq. Even if there were, the American view
(no letup in the pressure on Saddam Hussein) and the Russian,
Chinese and French line (that the crippling nine-year embargo must
be eased) seem irreconcilable.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, America wants to tighten the screws. Its planes have
bombed Iraq on average every three days since January, ostensibly
because of Iraqi infractions of the two ``no-fly zones'' that
America and Britain have declared in the north and south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Americans welcome any chance to weaken
Hussein's army. They still hope, Iraqi opposition groups say, that
eight years and five bombing campaigns after the Gulf war, the
Iraqi armed forces will turn on their master.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans insist that internal dissent _ as evidenced by the
bomb attack that killed several members of a Baghdad-based Iranian
militia on June 9 _ shows that Hussein's police state is weaker
than outsiders imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has long wanted to arm and train Iraqi opposition
groups to help them topple Hussein, and last year authorized the
administration to do that.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has dragged its feet, arguing that the
opposition is weak and divided, and none of Iraq's neighbors is
willing to support it. In late May it agreed to hand out some fax
machines and photocopiers for the war effort _ but no guns.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition group, the Iraqi National Congress (INC),
has smartened itself up, dropped its unpopular president, Ahmad
Chalabi, and recruited representatives from the most powerful
Kurdish, Shia and Sunni factions.
</P>
<P>
   This revamped INC plans to hold a much-hyped meeting next month,
hoping to turn decision-makers' heads.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an exceptionally hot, dry summer has withered
nearly three-quarters of this year's crops. The Tigris in Baghdad
is reduced to a third of its normal level, disease-ridden livestock
are dying of hunger, and worse is still to come.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program, whereby Iraq is allowed to sell some
oil to pay for humanitarian imports, has been hit by low oil prices
and run-down Iraqi infrastructure; in the past six months, it
raised $3 billion, $2.2 billion less than projected.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years that the scheme has run, Iraq's rates of
malnutrition and disease have stabilized, but education,
agriculture and electricity-generation have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has allowed Iraq to pump more oil but
America and Britain veto many contracts for new oil equipment. And
appeals for extra aid for Iraq's 20 million people have fallen on
deaf ears. &QL;

<P>
   For generals who are said by NATO to have lost around 6,000
troops, Serbia's commanders were remarkably defiant, before signing
up, on June 9, to a detailed plan for a complete and rapid
withdrawal of their troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The peace terms, calling for the swift deployment in the Serbian
province of a robust, western-dominated force, had become embroiled
in the murky intrigues of Belgrade and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But a flurry of telephone calls between the Kremlin and western
capitals, and hard diplomatic bargaining in Cologne between the
foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven rich countries,
eventually cleared the way for the generals on both sides to settle
the procedures for an orderly Serb retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military minds were concentrated by American bombers
continuing to pound their troops, killing ever-increasing numbers
until the last moment. Even the hard-won withdrawal plan, providing
for the Serbs to take away what remains of their armor and air
defenses, did not quite mark the end of NATO's 11-week-old
conflict, nor the onset of a new, peacekeeping phase.
</P>
<P>
   China said it would try to water down, though not block
completely, a U.N. Security Council resolution providing for a
well-armed force in Kosovo; the exact peacekeeping arrangements
were still subject to bargaining between America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But for General Mike Jackson, the Briton who commands NATO's
forces in Macedonia, reaching an agreement with the Serb commanders
was a welcome end to five days of Slav brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   A steady hardening of the Serbs' position had been encouraged by
the arrival at their side of General Yevgeny Barmyantsev, the
Russian military attache in Belgrade, who has never hidden his
longing to help Serbia fight NATO more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the man from Moscow, the Serbs' General Svetozar
Marjanovic presented his NATO counterparts with a string of new
objections.
</P>
<P>
   He needed more than a week to withdraw; NATO eventually agreed
on 11 days. He balked at NATO's demand for a demilitarized zone
outside Kosovo; the zone was finally cut from 25 km (15 miles) to 5
km.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he suggested that the pullout could not begin at
all until after NATO had stopped bombing and the U.N. Security
Council had passed a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Serbia's generals appear to agree that only a few
hundred of their troops should remain in Kosovo in the longer run.
</P>
<P>
   Something had clearly gone wrong with the deal that Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, and Finland's President Martti
Ahtisaari (speaking for the European Union) had seemingly forced on
Milosevic, with the explicit assent of Serbia's parliament, on June
3.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Chernomyrdin had been subjected to a chorus of
denunciation from the foreign and defense ministries, both hinting
that the ex-prime minister had imposed on Serbia an even greater
humiliation than was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, Milosevic conferred with Vojislav
Seselj, his deputy prime minister and leader of the
ultra-nationalist Radical Party, who bitterly opposed the peace
terms. He was later allowed on Serbian state television to voice
his objections.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj may have made a bargain with Milosevic under which the
Radicals will hold back from street demonstrations and from trying
to bring the government down. At what price?
</P>
<P>
   One grim possibility is Seselj and his cutthroats have been
allowed to settle scores with the more enlightened figures in
Serbia's narrow political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   A side-effect of all these maneuvers was the toughening of the
terms on which the Serbian and Russian governments would cooperate
with western plans for an international force to bring Kosovo's
800,000 or so refugees safely back home. But fears that the
generals in both Serbia (and Russia) had slipped their political
bosses' control seemed exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Serb soldiers will be angry over the war's outcome,
there seemed little reason to doubt that Milosevic, backed by the
secret service and interior ministry, could still deliver a deal
once deprived of any more wiggle-room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issues on which he and his commanders stood ground
until the last moment were more than technicalities. The most
delicate had to do with the exact timing of the military and
diplomatic steps needed to set Kosovo on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
   NATO insisted it would not stop bombing until the Serbs were
seen to be seriously withdrawing; Russia and China said they would
not sign up to a U.N. resolution to license a peacekeeping force so
long as NATO kept bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's initial response to the stiffening of Serbia's
terms was to harden its own position. Its commanders said on June 7
that it was up to the Serbs whether to seize their last chance for
an orderly withdrawal _ or be chased out by western firepower.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, an American B-52 bomber made the
biggest single attack of the bombing campaign, unleashing a load of
cluster bombs on a group of 1,000 or so soldiers on a hillside near
Kosovo's border with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Cologne, meanwhile, the bargaining picked up speed when Igor
Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, grudgingly agreed with his
counterparts from the G7 on the text of a U.N. resolution which,
without mentioning NATO explicitly, called for a robust
international presence in Kosovo. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The text says the Kosovo Liberation Army should ``comply with
the requirements'' of the peacekeepers' commander for
``demilitarization''; this leaves open the question of how much, if
at all, they will be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some aspects of the peacekeeping regime were left
for further bargaining, essentially between Russia, which is keen
to send 10,000 troops, and America, which seems happier about
humoring the Russians now that the broad outcome _ a Serb
withdrawal _ seems beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton assured Russia that its troops would
not be formally subordinated to NATO, which is preparing to put in
up to 50,000 of its own. But Strobe Talbott, America's envoy,
insisted on arrival in Moscow on June 10 that there would be no
Russian zone. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It appeared that responsibility for different parts of Kosovo
would be divided between five NATO countries: America, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The French, it first seemed, might police northern Kosovo (which
Russia coveted), Germany a southern strip. This would dash Serb
hopes that some areas would be set aside for troops from Russia or
other Serb-friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, critics of Chernomyrdin complained that the
peacekeeping structure still favored NATO far too much.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a bleak week for Serbia and its Slav friends.
But the 50-year-old alliance now faces its hardest peacekeeping
task in a landscape of mines, charred bodies and burned villages.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions is how, if at all, it is to protect
Kosovo's 150,000 Serbs from ethnic-Albanian revenge. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For generals who are said by NATO to have lost around 6,000
troops, Serbia's commanders were remarkably defiant, before signing
up, on June 9, to a detailed plan for a complete and rapid
withdrawal of their troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The peace terms, calling for the swift deployment in the Serbian
province of a robust, western-dominated force, had become embroiled
in the murky intrigues of Belgrade and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But a flurry of telephone calls between the Kremlin and western
capitals, and hard diplomatic bargaining in Cologne between the
foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven rich countries,
eventually cleared the way for the generals on both sides to settle
the procedures for an orderly Serb retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military minds were concentrated by American bombers
continuing to pound their troops, killing ever-increasing numbers
until the last moment. Even the hard-won withdrawal plan, providing
for the Serbs to take away what remains of their armor and air
defenses, did not quite mark the end of NATO's 11-week-old
conflict, nor the onset of a new, peacekeeping phase.
</P>
<P>
   China said it would try to water down, though not block
completely, a U.N. Security Council resolution providing for a
well-armed force in Kosovo; the exact peacekeeping arrangements
were still subject to bargaining between America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But for General Mike Jackson, the Briton who commands NATO's
forces in Macedonia, reaching an agreement with the Serb commanders
was a welcome end to five days of Slav brinkmanship.
</P>
<P>
   A steady hardening of the Serbs' position had been encouraged by
the arrival at their side of General Yevgeny Barmyantsev, the
Russian military attache in Belgrade, who has never hidden his
longing to help Serbia fight NATO more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the man from Moscow, the Serbs' General Svetozar
Marjanovic presented his NATO counterparts with a string of new
objections.
</P>
<P>
   He needed more than a week to withdraw; NATO eventually agreed
on 11 days. He balked at NATO's demand for a demilitarized zone
outside Kosovo; the zone was finally cut from 25 km (15 miles) to 5
km.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he suggested that the pullout could not begin at
all until after NATO had stopped bombing and the U.N. Security
Council had passed a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Serbia's generals appear to agree that only a few
hundred of their troops should remain in Kosovo in the longer run.
</P>
<P>
   Something had clearly gone wrong with the deal that Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, and Finland's President Martti
Ahtisaari (speaking for the European Union) had seemingly forced on
Milosevic, with the explicit assent of Serbia's parliament, on June
3.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Chernomyrdin had been subjected to a chorus of
denunciation from the foreign and defense ministries, both hinting
that the ex-prime minister had imposed on Serbia an even greater
humiliation than was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, meanwhile, Milosevic conferred with Vojislav
Seselj, his deputy prime minister and leader of the
ultra-nationalist Radical Party, who bitterly opposed the peace
terms. He was later allowed on Serbian state television to voice
his objections.
</P>
<P>
   Seselj may have made a bargain with Milosevic under which the
Radicals will hold back from street demonstrations and from trying
to bring the government down. At what price?
</P>
<P>
   One grim possibility is Seselj and his cutthroats have been
allowed to settle scores with the more enlightened figures in
Serbia's narrow political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   A side-effect of all these maneuvers was the toughening of the
terms on which the Serbian and Russian governments would cooperate
with western plans for an international force to bring Kosovo's
800,000 or so refugees safely back home. But fears that the
generals in both Serbia (and Russia) had slipped their political
bosses' control seemed exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Though many Serb soldiers will be angry over the war's outcome,
there seemed little reason to doubt that Milosevic, backed by the
secret service and interior ministry, could still deliver a deal
once deprived of any more wiggle-room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issues on which he and his commanders stood ground
until the last moment were more than technicalities. The most
delicate had to do with the exact timing of the military and
diplomatic steps needed to set Kosovo on the road to peace.
</P>
<P>
   NATO insisted it would not stop bombing until the Serbs were
seen to be seriously withdrawing; Russia and China said they would
not sign up to a U.N. resolution to license a peacekeeping force so
long as NATO kept bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's initial response to the stiffening of Serbia's
terms was to harden its own position. Its commanders said on June 7
that it was up to the Serbs whether to seize their last chance for
an orderly withdrawal _ or be chased out by western firepower.
</P>
<P>
   To drive home the point, an American B-52 bomber made the
biggest single attack of the bombing campaign, unleashing a load of
cluster bombs on a group of 1,000 or so soldiers on a hillside near
Kosovo's border with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In Cologne, meanwhile, the bargaining picked up speed when Igor
Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, grudgingly agreed with his
counterparts from the G7 on the text of a U.N. resolution which,
without mentioning NATO explicitly, called for a robust
international presence in Kosovo. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (150-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The text says the Kosovo Liberation Army should ``comply with
the requirements'' of the peacekeepers' commander for
``demilitarization''; this leaves open the question of how much, if
at all, they will be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some aspects of the peacekeeping regime were left
for further bargaining, essentially between Russia, which is keen
to send 10,000 troops, and America, which seems happier about
humoring the Russians now that the broad outcome _ a Serb
withdrawal _ seems beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton assured Russia that its troops would
not be formally subordinated to NATO, which is preparing to put in
up to 50,000 of its own. But Strobe Talbott, America's envoy,
insisted on arrival in Moscow on June 10 that there would be no
Russian zone. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that responsibility for different parts of Kosovo
would be divided between five NATO countries: America, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The French, it first seemed, might police northern Kosovo (which
Russia coveted), Germany a southern strip. This would dash Serb
hopes that some areas would be set aside for troops from Russia or
other Serb-friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, critics of Chernomyrdin complained that the
peacekeeping structure still favored NATO far too much.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a bleak week for Serbia and its Slav friends.
But the 50-year-old alliance now faces its hardest peacekeeping
task in a landscape of mines, charred bodies and burned villages.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions is how, if at all, it is to protect
Kosovo's 150,000 Serbs from ethnic-Albanian revenge. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   So who will be the West's proconsul for Kosovo, presuming that
such a job is on offer?
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bildt, a former international ``high representative'' to
Bosnia, tapped last month to be the U.N.'s special envoy to the
Balkans, is a front-runner, though he fiercely denies wanting the
post.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Americans, whom he has occasionally annoyed, let him
have it? Would his fellow Europeans want him to do it? Would he be
better suited to an even smarter-sounding job as the West's
coordinator of a grand strategy for boosting the entire Balkans?
And would he be up to taking on any such task?
</P>
<P>
   Bildt's credentials are impressive. For a start, he is a most
unusual _ indeed, a most unSwedish _ sort of Swede who, at 49, has
outgrown Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   This week he was nowhere to be seen in Stockholm, though he was
supposed to be leading his country's main opposition party, the
Moderates (who are on the free-market right), into elections to
Europe's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was in Geneva, trying to get international
do-gooding agencies, led by the U.N., into planning a rescue
package for Kosovo, before flying to New York to take matters
further.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, he has led the Moderates for 14 years, briefly _ as
prime minister from 1991 to 1994 _ loosening the Social Democrats'
corporatist grip, before tacitly conceding that most of his
compatriots are still loath to lose their high-tax,
welfare-cosseted, unadversarial way of life.
</P>
<P>
   And Bildt is ahead of the Swedish game (too much so,
electorally) in other respects.
</P>
<P>
   Most Swedes (and their parties in parliament) are against
joining NATO; cherish Sweden's longstanding neutrality; are muddled
or ambivalent about the European Union; and deeply wary of joining
Europe's single currency.
</P>
<P>
   Bildt, a passionate European who wants to see Sweden inside
NATO, disagrees on all counts _ and in doing so he flouts Sweden's
unspoken code of dignified consensus by speaking his mind candidly,
often with a waspish wit.
</P>
<P>
   He tends to treat people he considers fools (of whom there are
quite a few) ungladly, and chastises fellow Swedes for what he sees
as their limp-wristedness.
</P>
<P>
   He derides the Social Democrats' old boast that Sweden is (or at
least was) a ``moral superpower,'' pooh-poohs the idea of a Nordic
block, and cheekily queries whether, these days, Sweden has any
foreign policy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from Bosnia in 1997, and losing a general
election (not too badly) in 1998, his heart has not really been in
domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign fields are what beckon. Recently he married, as his
third wife, a clever and beautiful Italian he met in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   That was where his appetite for international troubleshooting
was whetted. His two-year term as ``high rep'' in Bosnia was, he
says, ``hell _ but I don't regret a second of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After co-chairing the peace talks in Dayton, he oversaw the
West's stuttering efforts to recreate a civil and political order.
</P>
<P>
   He did well just to keep the show on the road, but was hampered
by hideously unclear lines of command, by American-European
rivalries, and by the reluctance of the three antagonistic
communities to seek a genuine accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Refashioning Kosovo, he says, will be ``militarily easier,''
though the degradation, after the fighting, ethnic cleansing and
bombing, is much greater.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas in Bosnia the high representative was technically
answerable to no one in particular, in Kosovo, he hopes, there will
be a plainer ``de facto U.N. protectorate, protected by NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The lines of command, despite the anomaly of Russian troops
being somehow under but not answerable to NATO, should _ must _ be
clearer. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 625) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One reason why Bildt might not get the Kosovo job _ supposing
that he did want it _ is that quite a few Americans, including
probably Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state, are queasy
about him.
</P>
<P>
   He has an incorrigibly independent mind. What's more, he was
outspokenly hostile to NATO's bombing, particularly when combined,
at the start, with U.S. President Bill Clinton's intimation, which
Bildt openly deplored, that NATO would not fight its way in on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   He even wrote an article attacking NATO as ``baby bombers,'' and
rightly predicted that the bombing would produce ``1 million
refugees within two weeks,'' though he is unclear what the
alternative should have been. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has a good line to the Russians, but also keeps closely in
touch with Richard Holbrooke, the Americans' star Balkan fixer and
ambassador-designate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What Bildt argues most strongly (and has for several years) is
that the West must hurl itself far more heartily into
reconstruction _ not just in Kosovo or Bosnia, but across the
entire Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, he has often said, is ``not an exit strategy
from Bosnia but an entry strategy for the Balkans as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants a ``truly common foreign and security policy of the
European Union, a new and more radical integration across the
continent as a whole (including the Balkans), and a strengthened
and rebalanced relationship between the EU and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In tune with his zest for European unity, he bemoans the
consequences of trying to build latter-day Balkan nation-states out
of the ethnic mosaic that makes up ``that bloody mess called the
Balkans'' _ because ethnic cleansing, for which he castigates
Croats as much as Serbs, is the invariable means of that
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkanization of the Balkans has already gone too far,''
he says. Changing borders, let alone endorsing partition, is ``a
very long way down the list'' of options.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans should, he recently wrote, be treated as one big
region: ``The EU should provide the Balkan states with a clear
blueprint for reforms that would pave the way for close
integration, if not full membership of the EU. This would entail a
transfer of sovereignty to EU institutions in matters of economics
and structural issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Current Balkan barriers and borders, he says, must eventually
come down.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary, idealistic stuff, of course; Bildt is indeed an
idealist. But he is also tough, pragmatic and brave. ``He
understands power very well,'' says an ex-adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is asked to handle Kosovo or the whole region, he
could be the man for the job. &QL;

   One reason why Bildt might not get the Kosovo job _ supposing
that he did want it _ is that quite a few Americans, including
probably Madeleine Albright, the secretary of state, are queasy
about him.
</P>
<P>
   He has an incorrigibly independent mind. What's more, he was
outspokenly hostile to NATO's bombing, particularly when combined,
at the start, with U.S. President Bill Clinton's intimation, which
Bildt openly deplored, that NATO would not fight its way in on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   He even wrote an article attacking NATO as ``baby bombers,'' and
rightly predicted that the bombing would produce ``1 million
refugees within two weeks,'' though he is unclear what the
alternative should have been. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He has a good line to the Russians, but also keeps closely in
touch with Richard Holbrooke, the Americans' star Balkan fixer and
ambassador-designate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What Bildt argues most strongly (and has for several years) is
that the West must hurl itself far more heartily into
reconstruction _ not just in Kosovo or Bosnia, but across the
entire Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed, he has often said, is ``not an exit strategy
from Bosnia but an entry strategy for the Balkans as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   He wants a ``truly common foreign and security policy of the
European Union, a new and more radical integration across the
continent as a whole (including the Balkans), and a strengthened
and rebalanced relationship between the EU and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In tune with his zest for European unity, he bemoans the
consequences of trying to build latter-day Balkan nation-states out
of the ethnic mosaic that makes up ``that bloody mess called the
Balkans'' _ because ethnic cleansing, for which he castigates
Croats as much as Serbs, is the invariable means of that
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkanization of the Balkans has already gone too far,''
he says. Changing borders, let alone endorsing partition, is ``a
very long way down the list'' of options.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans should, he recently wrote, be treated as one big
region: ``The EU should provide the Balkan states with a clear
blueprint for reforms that would pave the way for close
integration, if not full membership of the EU. This would entail a
transfer of sovereignty to EU institutions in matters of economics
and structural issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Current Balkan barriers and borders, he says, must eventually
come down.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary, idealistic stuff, of course; Bildt is indeed an
idealist. But he is also tough, pragmatic and brave. ``He
understands power very well,'' says an ex-adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is asked to handle Kosovo or the whole region, he
could be the man for the job. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: Feeling dirty in Hollywood
 &HT;    1ST LEDE
 &HT;    (Eds: Removes references to Gettysburg in 7th graf.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Mrazek has a problem. He has produced a prize
pig, and now it's time to sell it to the slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Mrazek thinks so much of his pig that he's trying to make a
special deal, that once it becomes the property of the
slaughterhouse, it'll continue to receive kindly treatment, same as
if it had remained with him.
</P>
<P>
   Never gonna happen.
</P>
<P>
   In way of explanation ...
</P>
<P>
   What Mrazek is selling goes by the name of ``Stonewall's Gold.''
It's not really a pig, it's a novel that he's published. The
slaughterhouse is called Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Mrazek (pronounced ``muh-RAZ-ik'') is a former Congressman from
New York state, now living the life of a successful writer in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stonewall's Gold'' is all about the Civil War, which Mrazek
knows all about. He can even tell you who General Grant was
sleeping with on the night before his battles.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year I wrote a complimentary review of
``Stonewall's Gold,'' which, in truth, is about the only kind of
reviews I ever write. If I don't like a book, I won't take up your
time telling you about it.
</P>
<P>
   I liked ``Stonewall's Gold'' ($22.95, St. Martin's Press) as
much as anything I've read lately. Set in the final winter of the
Civil War, the story is told through the voice of a 15-year-old
Southerner, Jamie Lockhart, as he makes his way across the wilds of
Virginia in search of a secret cache of Yankee bullion.
</P>
<P>
   I had talked with Mrazek on the phone but never met him. While I
was in Washington, we made it a point to visit.
</P>
<P>
   What with the success of his first published novel _ picked by
Literary Guild for an alternative selection and included in the May
edition of Reader's Digest condensed books _ I thought he'd be as
happy as ... well, a pig in mud.
</P>
<P>
   Not so. Dealing with Hollywood for the film rights, he is
beginning to feel a bit soiled.
</P>
<P>
   He told several stories of his misadventures. This one was my
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   A producer was going on and on about how wonderful, how
marvelous, how truly touched by greatness his book was. But as a
film, what it really needed was ``contemporizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The author said he wasn't sure what the producer meant by
contemporizing. After all, it's a Civil War story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw 'Titanic,''' the producer said. ``You know the old
lady, the survivor, who remembers back on the sinking. That's what
we need for your story _ something today's kids can identify
with.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always Katharine Danridge, the beautiful young woman who
joins Jamie in the quest for gold. She was 18 at the time. That
would make her just a little past 150 years old now, Mrazek noted.
</P>
<P>
   A minor detail for Hollywood. Maybe she'd been frozen in time,
kidnapped by space aliens. There are all sorts of ways to get
around it _ as long as it's something today's kids can identify
with.
</P>
<P>
   Mrazek, as of this writing, hasn't made a decision on selling
the film rights. What he'd like is to have script approval, or even
better to write the movie version himself _ whatever is required to
preserve the integrity of the book.
</P>
<P>
   That well could happen.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hollywood may come around to his point of view.
</P>
<P>
   When pigs fly.

<P>
   The comes straight from a Clint Eastwood script. Victimized for
years by oppressive bandits, beleaguered villagers seek help from a
mysterious cowboy who rides into town from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows much about his background, and he reveals even
less. Yet he is the villagers' only hope, and, though greatly
outnumbered, he manages to drive off the men in black hats with a
single revolver that never runs out of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   So, gun in holster, George W. Bush sets out to end the
Democratic occupation of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As he makes his first trip to Iowa and New Hampshire, the
governor of Texas has tucked in his saddle bag an estimated $20
million in campaign contributions and hundreds of political
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   He also carries with him the expectations that he will broaden
his party's appeal to minorities, forge a rational foreign policy,
prolong the economic boom, and, if time permits, strengthen the
American family.
</P>
<P>
   While the tight-lipped Hollywood cowboy never had to define his
stance on gun control, Bush _ already criticized for failing to
back such controls in Texas after the Littleton, Colo. high-school
shootings _ is now going to have to do that, and a great deal more.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a ravenous press corps eager to grill him on a range of
subjects, and a pack of Republican presidential opponents who can
finally take shots at him.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates have the luxury of easing into a campaign
by honing their message in front of small groups, Bush, as the
leader of the pack, is beginning his run under the glare of an
international spotlight. His peaceful life in Austin will soon seem
a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may be impossible for the governor to live up to his
billing, he could start by putting substance behind his vague
campaign motto of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As he travels the country, he can brag about a strong Texas
record of tax cuts, education reform and broad minority support,
yet he will have to suggest that his program can be successful
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he must sell his ideas to social conservatives,
who never trusted his ``kinder, gentler'' father and seem equally
skeptical about Bush the Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Although the religious wing of the Republican Party is likely to
fall in line if Bush wins his party's nomination _ they have
nowhere else to go _ socially conservative candidates such as Gary
Bauer and Dan Quayle could give him great headaches during the
primaries over issues such as abortion, on which Bush performs that
well-known Republican straddle of disliking it personally, but
backing the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   He is already in some trouble over taxes, as his father famously
was before him. Bush-la-pere lost the 1992 election, in large part,
because he promised ``No new taxes'' and then broke his word.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-le-fils, in a telephone interview with a group of New
Hampshire journalists on June 8, also vowed he would not raise
taxes if elected president, a pretty foolish corner to back himself
into.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in a typical wriggle, he declined actually to sign a
pledge to oppose any tax increase that might be put before him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush must also silence the skeptics who question his knowledge
of foreign affairs. He has given them fuel in recent weeks both
with his reluctance to take a stand on Kosovo, and with his public
statement that America should take care ``to keep good relations
with the Grecians.'' (Presumably, not at the expense of the
country's relations with Sparta.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the governor himself lacks international experience, he
makes up for it with a seasoned foreign-policy team that briefs him
regularly: a group dominated by cold-warriors, such as Richard
Perle, who have not thawed out much a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's recent public statements have been hawkish (especially
over China), and Republican leaders are hopeful that a coherent
``Bush Doctrine'' will be the antidote to two terms of Clinton
muddle.
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of governors, congressmen and businessmen in his
camp, Bush is undoubtedly the candidate of the Republican
establishment. Rival Republican candidates have been left to
scramble for the scraps. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So desperate are party leaders (especially those in Congress) to
reclaim the White House and retain their majority on Capitol Hill
that, even before their favorite has committed himself, they have
already met Bush and forged a unified agenda for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   This has produced rumblings among conservatives that in their
desperation for a winner, Republican leaders are sacrificing
ideology for strategy, selling the party's soul for the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   They quietly disparage Bush's vapid public statements as
Clintonesque, and one staffer for Lamar Alexander (a rival whose
campaign seems on the brink of shutting up shop already) goes so
far as to call the governor a ``force of evil'' within the
Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Others grumble that the real star of the Bush family is George's
younger brother Jeb, the governor of Florida. Jeb has just won
approval for a statewide school-voucher plan, while George failed
to persuade the Texas legislature that it wanted any such thing. &QL;

<P>
   Bush's opponents, both in Texas and outside it, have
characterized him as a political neophyte, a wayward businessman
trying to ride the coattails of a famous name.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, however, politics is the first arena where Bush has
had real professional success. As an oil man, his companies struck
far more dry holes than gushers.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he often jokes about his time as part-owner of the
Texas Rangers baseball team, which failed to shine during his
tenure.
</P>
<P>
   After an uneasy time in Washington advising his father, Bush has
finally found a comfortable home in Texas politics, enjoying
statewide approval ratings approaching 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems to want to return to Washington. To get there, he
is going to have to fill in the blanks both in his vision of the
road ahead, and in his hazy recollection of what came before.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has given up booze, married a librarian, and found
God, Bush may finally have to answer media questions about his
``reckless youth.'' Perhaps most important, he must be so set on
the prize that he is able to recover quickly from the inevitable
setbacks along the trail.
</P>
<P>
   For the shoot-outs and saloon brawls that await him, Bush must
show he has the two things most indispensable to any cowboy: a
quick draw and an iron jaw. &QL;

PANAMA EXPECTS TO REAP BONANZA FROM CANAL OPERATION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALBOA, Panama _ To Americans, the Panama Canal is an icon of
progress and engineering savvy. But to Panamanians, who are about
to start running it, the canal represents a spillway of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Since the canal opened in 1914, more than 700,000 ships have
passed through its locks, shelling out billions of dollars in user
fees. The Konkar Star, for example, paid $79,000 for its recent
transit through the 50-mile route.
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials, who begin operating the canal Dec. 31,
believe that it will be an even bigger moneymaker. They plan to
streamline operations and push for higher earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit is not a nasty word,'' says Mercedes Morris Garcia, a
spokeswoman for the Panama Canal Commission, the U.S.-Panamanian
agency that has run the canal since 1979. In its first year of
ownership, Panama expects to earn $30 million off the canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make it a competitive organization that's much more
in line with basic business principles in a global economy,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warn, however, that Panama must not treat the waterway
like a money machine. If too many corners are cut, they say, the
canal will lose its hard-earned reputation for safety and service.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people watch this place and think they can make it
into a real cash cow,'' says George Markham, the canal's transit
operations director, who will retire in June.
</P>
<P>
   But, the American adds, ``the Panama Canal is a plant coming up
on 100 years old, and it needs a lot of maintenance. You can't
screw around with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States set up the Panama Canal Co. at the turn of the
century as a nonprofit federal utility with an army of employees.
</P>
<P>
   One early canal worker quoted by historian David McCullough in
his book ``The Path Between the Seas'' described the company as ``a
bureaucracy that's got Russia backed off the map.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hulking as it was, the system worked. Canal company
employees religiously followed a costly schedule of repairs and
maintenance. The number of ship-transits through the canal
multiplied. The locks functioned smoothly. Accidents were rare.
Maritime traffic ran on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary function wasn't efficiency, but to keep it
operating in a safe manner,'' said a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   From 1914 until 1974, tolls were frozen at 90 cents per ton for
laden ships. Such charges were calculated to cover salaries,
maintenance, capital improvements and an annual stipend to the
Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that the canal's U.S. administrators could have
charged much more in tolls, because for decades the waterway was a
trade-artery monopoly. Ship captains much preferred the canal to
the expensive, monthlong voyage around the tip of South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, there were no alternatives. Under those
conditions, it could have generated huge profits,'' says Juan
Jovane, an economist at the University of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   But Panamanians have long complained that the low tolls
subsidized the canal's main clients, U.S. shippers, and
short-changed their own government. Of the $10 billion in revenue
collected since the canal opened, Panama has received $1.69
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy that benefited the most from the canal was the
U.S. economy,'' says Charles Langman, director of Associated
Steamship Agents, a Panama firm that represents canal users.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Fernando Manfredo, a former canal executive: ``Panama was
just getting crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Such resentments as well as growing nationalism drove Panama's
leader in the mid-1970s, Gen. Omar Torrijos, to seek a new deal
with Washington. In 1977, Torrijos and President Carter signed the
Panama Canal treaties, which mandated the gradual transfer of the
waterway to Panamanian control by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, more than 95 percent of the canal's workforce has
been Panamanian, including the top administrator of the Panama
Canal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At noon Dec. 31, the newly formed Panama Canal Authority, an
autonomous Panamanian board made up of business executives and
canal veterans, will begin operating the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal has an incredible future,'' says Marco Gandasegui, a
Panamanian political analyst. ``Sea commerce is growing. We're in
the middle of a great bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, annual revenues have jumped from $329 million in 1989 to
a record $545 million last year. Panama's share of 1998 earnings
was $118 million, and that figure is likely to rise in the future.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 ship transits per day, the canal is running at full
capacity. But a project to widen the Gaillard Cut, the waterway's
narrowest section, will allow for two-way traffic through the cut
and increase transits to 43 ships per day by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Panama has told clients that no new toll hikes are in store in
the immediate future. But Langman says canal officials are
considering a new toll structure under which cargo with a higher
value would pay more.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the canal's operators are trimming expenses.
In the past year, hundreds of the waterway's 9,700 employees have
accepted buyouts and retired early. According to Morris Garcia, the
spokeswoman for the canal commission, the number of workers will
probably stabilize somewhere between 7,500 and 8,500.
</P>
<P>
   Others savings, she says, could come from privatizing what she
calls ``nonessential'' canal operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's unclear just how much more money Panama can realize.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat says he has heard some Panamanian politicians talk
of nearly doubling profits to $200 million annually _ a figure that
many analysts call unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panama is getting a handsome profit from the canal right
now,'' says Jurgen Dorfmeier, president of the Panamanian Maritime
Chamber. ``I doubt very much that there is anyone who feels that
they can get much more out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors may work against an immediate surge in profits.
For one thing, the canal treaties stipulate that toll rates must
remain reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the canal is no longer the only transoceanic route.
If the current toll of $2.57 per ton is sharply increased, shippers
may opt for ship-to-rail land bridges across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be realistic,'' says Juan Jovane, an economist at
the University of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, when canal workers switch from being U.S. to
Panamanian government employees, any effort to cut more jobs or to
reduce salaries and benefits is likely to face stiff opposition
from labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we will have more work, not better service,'' says
Carmen Santamaria, a canal traffic controller, when asked about the
effect of possible staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, any increase in earnings could be partially offset by
the closing of 10 U.S. military bases and the withdrawal of 10,000
U.S. troops under the terms of the canal treaties. Panama is
expected to lose up to $300 million in annual economic activity as
well as 4,000 well-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the former U.S. bases and about 500 square miles of prime
real estate along the canal present a potential windfall for
Panama. Already, Albrook Air Base has been turned into a commuter
airport, and vacated U.S. troop barracks and other properties now
house factories and container ports. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``With the canal becoming an integrated part of the economy, I
think it will be a pole for development,'' says Langman of
Associated Steamship Agents.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics are concerned that Panamanian officials will
turn to the canal when tax revenues run short or that they will
favor their political allies with lucrative contracts in the canal
area, according to Gandasegui, the political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for abuse was made clear last year. In an
embarrassing political scandal, two government ministers were
accused of receiving special treatment in the purchase of
canal-area homes left behind by departing U.S. military officers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, President Ernesto Perez Balladares has been
criticized for naming several relatives to the nine-member board of
the Panama Canal Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But an official with Denmark-based Maersk Line, the canal's
second-largest client, says that the autonomous nature of the
authority should shield it from government pressures. He described
its members as well-respected executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys know what they are doing,'' says Hans Moller,
managing director for Maersk Lines in Panama. ``We are watching the
developments very closely, and we have a lot of faith that the new
administration will continue to offer safe and reliable service.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, Dorfmeier says, clients will simply go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shipping is not going to stop if the canal closes tomorrow,''
he says ``I think that Panama has learned that if they don't handle
this correctly, the only one that will lose out is Panama.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ A year ago, Arnold Levine agreed to help clean up
Sunnyside Park, a half-acre stretch of grass and trees in a
middle-class San Francisco neighborhood. Along with other
volunteers, Levine, a Londoner by origin, wiped out graffiti,
chased out drug dealers and in general spruced up the little park.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful youngsters and their families swarmed all over it. But
now, says Levine, he fears that Sunnyside Park will lose out to an
unexpected adversary: dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 19 parks due to become ``off-leash'' areas as San
Francisco tries to accommodate the growing number of dogs living
within the city.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has pleaded with officials to maintain the park primarily
for local people and their children _ and for dogs on a leash. He
has been cursed by dog owners, chaired meetings that dissolved into
shouting matches, and recently opened his car door to find a pile
of dog-poop on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog owners have obviously tried to send me a message,''
Levine explains.
</P>
<P>
   Few issues are hotter just now in urban America than whether
dogs should be given free run of public parks in these off-leash
areas (OLAs, in bureaucratese).
</P>
<P>
   Battles over dogs have erupted in Florida, Oregon, New York,
Connecticut, Wyoming and Washington, to name but a few. ``I would
equate it to abortion,'' Nick Licata says with a gulp; he is a city
councillor here in Seattle who has tried to mediate between dog
owners and the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the woofing? Canine demographics, for one thing. It is
reckoned that 58 million dogs live in the United States. Although
the number has held steady (and is now exceeded by the 66 million
or so cats kept as pets), several new developments have complicated
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For one, more and more dogs are living in cities or thickly
populated suburbs where they have no back gardens in which to romp
(or dump). It also seems that many dog owners are opting for larger
breeds; the boisterous, bulky Labrador retriever is now the most
popular breed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, many people have come to regard dogs as
something more than a furry household accessory. They have become
family members, showered with Christmas gifts and birthday presents
and treated to a romp on the park as readily as a five-year-old
child would be.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities have long looked the other way as dogs ran loose in
the parks and the streets. But, as American cities have grown more
attractive and property values have risen, humans have sought to
reassert their control over the parks.
</P>
<P>
   A culture clash almost worthy of the Balkans has resulted. Dog
owners cannot see why everyone doesn't find Shiloh or Molly or
Sheba adorable. Non-owners feel harassed by rambunctious dogs, and
see parks becoming dog-poop minefields.
</P>
<P>
   Most dog owners manage their dogs responsibly, says Nicholas
Dodman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Tufts University and
the author of several books on dogs. But, as is so often the case,
the bad behavior of the few tars the many.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman is particularly disturbed by the dog owner who pretends
to be surprised when his animal attacks someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people who come to me with aggressive dogs know that
their dogs are aggressive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, two unleashed Rottweilers in Seattle attacked and
nearly killed a two-year-old. Officials destroyed one dog; the
owner then claimed the other dog was trying to ``save'' the child.
</P>
<P>
   Often the dog problem is not really a dog problem at all; it is
a people problem.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, the quality-of-life crackdown on
squeegee men and jaywalkers by the city's mayor, Rudolf Giuliani,
has recently been imitated in a campaign against unruly dogs led by
Henry Stern, the parks commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has proposed tighter enforcement of leash laws and bigger
fines for off-leash scofflaws. To support his case, he has amassed
a stack of letters from irate New Yorkers. Most of them complain
more about abusive dog owners than aggressive dogs.
</P>
<P>
   One recalled being harassed by a large off-the-leash mutt.
``Quit moving, and the dog won't bother you,'' explained the owner.
</P>
<P>
   It can be worse than that. One owner gave the name of ``Eva
Braun'' when stopped for having an illegally off-leash dog, and
another hung a sign marked ``Treblinka'' on a newly installed
anti-dog fence.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a moral. So far in America dog owners have had the
upper hand. As Licata observes, most of the people who turn up at
meetings to discuss the issue are those with dogs, not with
grouches about dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This may be changing. In Avon, Conn., leash-law supporters
handily outvoted supporters of more liberal off-leash rules in a
referendum last year. If enough dogs behave badly enough, a lot
more victims are liable to turn on the people who own the dogs. &QL;

   ABOARD THE KONKAR STAR, Panama _ ``Dead slow ahead!'' barks
Robert Holden, a pilot on the Panama Canal, as he guides a Greek
freighter through the world's most famous shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead slow ahead!'' echoes Nanidis Spiridon, the fidgety,
chain-smoking Greek captain whose ship, the Konkar Star, is packed
with 57,000 metric tons of yellow corn on a voyage from New Orleans
to Nagoya, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dead slow ahead!'' confirms the coxswain, as he follows
Holden's order to cut the ship's engines to minimum speed.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the Panama Canal, Holden, a Massachusetts native who has
worked on the waterway since 1969, is part autocrat, part artist.
</P>
<P>
   His curt instructions set off a chain reaction of bustle and
fuss by the Konkar Star's captain and crew that will allow the ship
to fool nature by floating up and over the isthmus separating the
Atlantic and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   But Holden and the rest of the Zonians, the thousands of
Americans who have lived and worked along the canal for nearly a
century, are a disappearing breed.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties, the United States must
turn over full control of the waterway to Panama at noon Dec. 31
and close the last of its 10 military bases in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The actions will complete the handover of the U.S.-administered
territory once known as the Canal Zone and will mark the end of the
American Era in Panama, an epoch that began in 1904 when President
Theodore Roosevelt vowed to ``make dirt fly'' by digging a great
trench across the Panamanian isthmus.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Path Between the Seas,'' historian David
McCullough writes that Roosevelt viewed the project as ``a mighty
battle in which the national honor was at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm of the former Rough Rider, who led a charge
during the Battle of San Juan Hill in Cuba during the
Spanish-American war of 1898, caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Although thousands of workers, mostly laborers from Caribbean
islands, were killed during the construction process, the Panama
Canal was an unparalleled engineering feat that became a symbol of
the pell-mell rush for progress.
</P>
<P>
   Jungles were tamed, mountains were moved, malaria and yellow
fever were conquered. Nearly as amazing, the mammoth public works
project came in $23 million under budget. The United States spent
$352 million to build it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Panama Canal opened in 1914, the planet seemed to
become smaller. Sea travel from New York to San Francisco was
shortened by 8,000 miles and several months' time, since ships no
longer were forced to sail around Cape Horn in South America.
</P>
<P>
   The canal also helped make the United States a naval power. The
triumph was celebrated on the official Canal Zone seal: ``The Land
Divided _ The World United.''
</P>
<P>
   Panamanian officials predict that the handover of the canal will
be routine. But Holden calls the Panama Canal treaties ``a big
mistake'' and worries that the waterway's new owners will seek
higher profits by cutting back on maintenance, personnel and
training. Until now, the canal has functioned as a break-even
utility, with most of its earnings plowed back into operations and
upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Since Holden moved to what was then the U.S.-run Panama Canal
Zone 30 years ago, he has married, reared two children and coaxed
more than 2,400 ships safely through the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with it,'' says Holden, moments after the
Konkar Star had been lifted 85 feet by the first set of locks on
the Atlantic side and released into the artificial Gatun Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The length of three football fields, the Konkar Star can stow
the equivalent in weight of 250 Boeing 747s. This floating
leviathan must be shoehorned into the canal's snug-fitting locks
and squeezed through its bottleneck channels. At times, Holden's
margin for error is a matter of inches.
</P>
<P>
   The task is so tricky that the Panama Canal is the only body of
water in the world where, by law, the ship's captain must
temporarily turn over command of his vessel to the pilot _ a leap
of faith that skippers are normally loath to take. Canal pilots
earn up to $160,000 a year, more than the top executive on the
Panama Canal Commission, the joint U.S.-Panamanian agency that runs
the waterway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very demanding pilot's job. In my mind it was the
optimum career for a seagoing person,'' says Holden, a graduate of
the Federal Maritime Academy on Long Island and a Navy veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Because of shifting world trade patterns and competition from
rail lines that haul giant freight containers from seaports to
customers, the canal is no longer the vital strategic link or the
shipping monopoly it once was.
</P>
<P>
   Yet business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 14,244 ships passed through the waterway, shelling
out a record $545 million in tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the world's ships can go through here.
That's amazing for something this old,'' Holden says.
</P>
<P>
   The waterway was so well-designed that it functions almost
exactly the way it did 85 years ago, with many of the original
parts. The canal is built like a Brink's truck but runs like a
Swiss watch, said transit operations director George Markham.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A BIT OF HISTORY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1800s, French engineers who were inspired and
cajoled by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the mastermind of Egypt's Suez
Canal, spent 20 years in Panama trying to excavate a sea-level
waterway.
</P>
<P>
   One member of a pickax crew was Paul Gauguin, the French
painter, who described the job in a letter to his wife: ``I have to
dig from 5:30 in the morning to six in the evening, under tropical
sun and rain. At night, I am devoured by mosquitoes.'' Gauguin
lasted a few months, then sailed for Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   De Lesseps' crusade was eventually undone by disease, landslides
and flooding from the mighty Chagres River, which cuts through the
middle of Panama. Then the U.S. government stepped in, paying the
French $40 million for the canal rights and properties and
fomenting Panama's revolt from Colombia. After the Panamanians
gained independence, the Americans took over the canal's
construction in 1904.
</P>
<P>
   Following much debate, they settled on a lock-and-dam system to
lift vessels, step by step, up and over the isthmus, then lower
them back to sea level. One of their models was the Soo Locks, the
gateway between Lake Superior and Lake Huron that was, at the time,
the world's most heavily traveled lock canal.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, U.S. planners were determined to harness the
power of the Chagres River, which was considered ``the lion in the
path'' of the waterway. By damming the Chagres and flooding the
jungle, they formed a massive reservoir to serve as a kind of water
bridge for nearly half of the canal's route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, the river would become the lifeblood of the system,
rather than its mortal enemy,'' writes historian McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   The result is Gatun Lake, which covers 163 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   To Holden, the lake is the easiest and safest part of the canal
transit, and he keeps the Konkar Star churning through its
whitecaps and toward the Pacific Ocean at a steady 10 knots per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilot must stick to a tight schedule. It takes about
nine hours to cross the 50-milelong canal, and flotillas of
tankers, container ships and cruise liners wait at both entrances
for the green light to begin their journeys. A 15-minute delay by
Holden could translate into a four-hour wait for a crew three ships
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   With its pilots, traffic controllers, radar, cargo handlers,
fueling stations and 24-hour operations, the Panama Canal can seem
like a sprawling, congested international airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A year ago, Arnold Levine agreed to help clean up
Sunnyside Park, a half-acre stretch of grass and trees in a
middle-class San Francisco neighborhood. Along with other
volunteers, Levine, a Londoner by origin, wiped out graffiti,
chased out drug dealers and in general spruced up the little park.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful youngsters and their families swarmed all over it. But
now, says Levine, he fears that Sunnyside Park will lose out to an
unexpected adversary: dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of 19 parks due to become ``off-leash'' areas as San
Francisco tries to accommodate the growing number of dogs living
within the city.
</P>
<P>
   Levine has pleaded with officials to maintain the park primarily
for local people and their children _ and for dogs on a leash. He
has been cursed by dog owners, chaired meetings that dissolved into
shouting matches, and recently opened his car door to find a pile
of dog-poop on the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dog owners have obviously tried to send me a message,''
Levine explains.
</P>
<P>
   Few issues are hotter just now in urban America than whether
dogs should be given free run of public parks in these off-leash
areas (OLAs, in bureaucratese).
</P>
<P>
   Battles over dogs have erupted in Florida, Oregon, New York,
Connecticut, Wyoming and Washington, to name but a few. ``I would
equate it to abortion,'' Nick Licata says with a gulp; he is a city
councillor here in Seattle who has tried to mediate between dog
owners and the rest of humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the woofing? Canine demographics, for one thing. It is
reckoned that 58 million dogs live in the United States. Although
the number has held steady (and is now exceeded by the 66 million
or so cats kept as pets), several new developments have complicated
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For one, more and more dogs are living in cities or thickly
populated suburbs where they have no back gardens in which to romp
(or dump). It also seems that many dog owners are opting for larger
breeds; the boisterous, bulky Labrador retriever is now the most
popular breed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse, many people have come to regard dogs as
something more than a furry household accessory. They have become
family members, showered with Christmas gifts and birthday presents
and treated to a romp on the park as readily as a five-year-old
child would be.
</P>
<P>
   Most cities have long looked the other way as dogs ran loose in
the parks and the streets. But, as American cities have grown more
attractive and property values have risen, humans have sought to
reassert their control over the parks.
</P>
<P>
   A culture clash almost worthy of the Balkans has resulted. Dog
owners cannot see why everyone doesn't find Shiloh or Molly or
Sheba adorable. Non-owners feel harassed by rambunctious dogs, and
see parks becoming dog-poop minefields.
</P>
<P>
   Most dog owners manage their dogs responsibly, says Nicholas
Dodman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Tufts University and
the author of several books on dogs. But, as is so often the case,
the bad behavior of the few tars the many.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman is particularly disturbed by the dog owner who pretends
to be surprised when his animal attacks someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people who come to me with aggressive dogs know that
their dogs are aggressive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, two unleashed Rottweilers in Seattle attacked and
nearly killed a two-year-old. Officials destroyed one dog; the
owner then claimed the other dog was trying to ``save'' the child.
</P>
<P>
   Often the dog problem is not really a dog problem at all; it is
a people problem.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, the quality-of-life crackdown on
squeegee men and jaywalkers by the city's mayor, Rudolf Giuliani,
has recently been imitated in a campaign against unruly dogs led by
Henry Stern, the parks commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has proposed tighter enforcement of leash laws and bigger
fines for off-leash scofflaws. To support his case, he has amassed
a stack of letters from irate New Yorkers. Most of them complain
more about abusive dog owners than aggressive dogs.
</P>
<P>
   One recalled being harassed by a large off-the-leash mutt.
``Quit moving, and the dog won't bother you,'' explained the owner.
</P>
<P>
   It can be worse than that. One owner gave the name of ``Eva
Braun'' when stopped for having an illegally off-leash dog, and
another hung a sign marked ``Treblinka'' on a newly installed
anti-dog fence.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies a moral. So far in America dog owners have had the
upper hand. As Licata observes, most of the people who turn up at
meetings to discuss the issue are those with dogs, not with
grouches about dogs.
</P>
<P>
   This may be changing. In Avon, Conn., leash-law supporters
handily outvoted supporters of more liberal off-leash rules in a
referendum last year. If enough dogs behave badly enough, a lot
more victims are liable to turn on the people who own the dogs. &QL;

ABOARD THE KONKAR STAR, Panama: congested international airport.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The threat of accidents is constant. The morning Holden boards
the Konkar Star, a Panama City newspaper carries a front-page story
about a ship that had collided with a canal dredge.
</P>
<P>
   Some vessels carry nuclear waste in their holds. Others are what
shippers call ``drugstore tankers,'' vessels packed with liquid
propane, ammonia and other chemicals. A fully loaded petroleum
tanker contains more potential energy than the atomic bomb that
detonated over Hiroshima in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, ships don't have brakes and may require 10 minutes
to stop by reversing the engines, calling in tugboats or, as a last
resort, dragging their anchors. On the high seas, captains like to
stay miles away from other vessels. On the Panama Canal, the leeway
can be a few hundred feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four or five hours of boredom followed by five minutes of
sheer terror,'' says Holden, who is perched on a red vinyl stool in
the Konkar Star's wheelhouse and wearing sunglasses and a black
baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Holden always gives passing ships the widest possible berth. He
learned that lesson a decade ago when an oncoming vessel carrying
automobiles lost power and slammed into Holden's vessel, ripping a
200-foot hole in the hull.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of a passing ship, he says, ``You have to bend to her,
because she's not going to bend to you.''
</P>
<P>
   From day one, Panama Canal pilots are indoctrinated with safety
regulations. They train and work for eight years on smaller vessels
before earning ``senior pilot'' status, which allows them to handle
so-called ``panamax'' ships, such as the Konkar Star. These are the
largest ships that can fit through the canal's locks.
</P>
<P>
   Training includes tests in a multimillion-dollar pilot
simulator, which re-creates the conditions inside a ship's
wheelhouse during a transit. By twisting a few knobs, technicians
can add rainstorms, oncoming tankers and a shifting floor. It's so
realistic that students in the simulator, which is located near the
canal, have become seasick and vomited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all the dynamics of real life,'' says David Constable,
a pilot-training coordinator. ``Over here is the place to make a
mistake, not in the canal.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays may be frowned upon, but, in the name of safe passage,
they are unavoidable. At the Panama Canal pilots union hall,
someone has posted a sign reminding members: ``Your schedule is
more flexible than your ship.''
</P>
<P>
   In his training manual, Markham, the transit operations
director, warns rookies against getting self-righteous about their
ship's course with this verse by an anonymous scribe:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the grave of Mike O'Day,
</P>
<P>
   Who died maintaining his right of way.
</P>
<P>
   His right was clear, his will was strong,
</P>
<P>
   But he's just as dead as if he'd been wrong.``
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A DANGEROUS JOURNEY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Gatun Lake, the Konkar Star enters a narrow ribbon of
water.
</P>
<P>
   This 8-mile passageway is known as the Gaillard Cut, but those
who built it called it Hell's Gorge. Their job amounted to removing
a tropical mountain of rock, shale and mud. It took seven years and
millions of pounds of dynamite to complete the task. Avalanches and
accidental explosions killed hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flesh of men flew in the air like birds many days,''
according to a West Indian laborer quoted by McCullough in ``The
Path Between the Seas.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the sensation of the equatorial wilderness being
rolled back is the strongest, where the canal resembles an immense,
man-made culvert.
</P>
<P>
   Dirt hills rise sharply out of the water and tower over the
ship. Due to landslides and erosion, bulldozers, dredges and
sappers work continuously to keep the cut more than 50 feet deep,
which allows the passage of the panamax ships. The nearly nonstop
excavations have stained the canal's sparkling blue-green water a
chalky gray.
</P>
<P>
   The trip through the cut is a squeeze for the Konkar Star, but
finessing the vessel into the canal's three sets of locks seems
almost impossible. The ship is 106 feet wide; lock chambers are
just 110 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to force an olive into a full wine bottle
without spilling,'' Holden says.
</P>
<P>
   On this transit, the chore of entering the canal's second set of
locks will be left to another pilot, because Holden is ready for a
breather. It's 1 p.m., and he's been up since 3 a.m., sipping
coffee all the while to stay alert. He drinks 12 to 14 cups a day.
</P>
<P>
   Panamax vessels require two pilots on board during a voyage
through the canal, and Holden is relieved by Jose Lin Young, a
30-something Panamanian outfitted in pressed Tommy Hilfiger khaki.
Holden trots down the metal staircase to the officers' mess, which
is decorated with Greek tourism posters, and digs into a plate of
spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   As Young guides the Konkar Star into the Pedro Miguel locks,
where the ship will begin its descent to sea level, Spiridon, the
Greek captain, inhales deeply on a Dunhill cigarette and studies
the new pilot's every move.
</P>
<P>
   After a ship moves into a lock, the water beneath the vessel is
forced out, creating pressures and currents that can push the ship
off course. Stability is provided by tugboats, which nudge the
stern of the Konkar Star, and by land-based locomotives with cables
that are attached to the port and starboard sides of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how close the ship is to the lock wall, Holden, who has
returned to the wheelhouse to watch the ship's progress, looks down
and replies: ``Right now? About 9 inches.``
</P>
<P>
   But Young makes it in, and the lock gates close behind the ship.
As water drains from the chamber, the Konkar Star slowly sinks 31
feet. By the time the ship reaches the Pacific, 52 million gallons
of fresh water will have been flushed from the canal out to sea _
the equivalent of a two-day water supply for a large city.
</P>
<P>
   When the front gate opens, the Konkar Star struggles forward. As
the locomotives strain, the port side of the ship touches the lock
wall, making a low-pitched grinding sound. Gray debris scraped off
the lock flies into the air and lands on the ship's deck.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting instructions to his mostly Filipino crew, Spiridon
races down five flights of stairs to inspect the damage. It's
impossible to see the scrape from the deck, so he climbs down a
rope ladder on the side of the ship to a tugboat waiting below.
</P>
<P>
   With both vessels moving through the canal, the portly Spiridon
balances on the deck of the tug and rubs his hands over the
20-foot-long scratch above the ship's waterline. The paint is gone,
but there appears to be no structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   After the inspection, Spiridon demands to be returned to his
ship immediately, even though the tug captain had planned to stop
briefly at a nearby wharf first. ``I don't want to leave this pilot
alone!'' Spiridon shouts.

ABOARD THE KONKAR STAR, Panama: Spiridon shouts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later, after the emotion of the moment ebbs, Spiridon explains
that maritime veterans are uneasy about the exodus of the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the canal's remaining U.S. pilots will retire this
year, including Holden, who plans to move to Palm Harbor, Fla., at
year's end. The pilots union says that, to make up for the loss,
the incoming canal officials may cut back on training requirements
for senior pilots and reduce the number of pilots required aboard
panamax ships from two to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the captains? They are having a heart attack,''
Spiridon says in heavily accented English. ``They don't prepare the
new pilots very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Young shares some of these concerns. But he points out that more
than 200 of the current 275 canal pilots are Panamanians. That is
the highest number since the canal opened. Yet last year, just 30
serious accidents occurred, the lowest number since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes Morris Garcia, a spokeswoman for the Panama Canal
Commission, insists that the transition will be smooth. But she
admits that Panama bears the burden of proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can say it until we're blue in the face,'' she said. ``But
people won't believe it until they see it.''
</P>
<P>
   After clearing the final set of locks, the Konkar Star steams
into the Port of Balboa on the Pacific at dusk. Because of Panama's
slender, twisting shape, the area around Balboa is the only spot on
the globe where the sun rises over the Pacific and sets on the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   As he bids farewell to the Konkar Star and hops aboard a tugboat
for the wharf, Holden is feeling a bit turned-around himself. He
will try to adapt to retirement in Florida, but his heart is
anchored in the former Canal Zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very comfortable life. People thought of it as a
Utopia,'' says Holden, who plays tennis and bridge with other
Zonians in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their way of life is ending. Panamanians are taking over
the jobs once held by the Zonians, and the Panamanian government is
taking over their housing. Just a handful of Americans will be
rehired by the incoming Canal Authority, and their jobs will be
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Americans have already left Panama. Others are
making reservations for the journey back to the United States,
though a few have decided to settle in Panama. Families must leave
by mid-August if they want the U.S. government to pay their moving
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Americans' neat, cinderblock duplexes are already
vacant. Boats with ``for sale'' signs line the streets. Every
weekend, dozens of garage sales are held. Banks, churches and
baseball leagues have all shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa High School, the main school for Zonians, graduated its
final senior class May 15 and will soon become Panama's Foreign
Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving it all behind is proving difficult. The other day, a
Zonian who was clearly drunk was so bitter that he refused to speak
with a reporter. Nearby, in the sleepy, palm-lined American
community of Cardenas, tensions are on the rise as families are
uprooted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is all stressed out,'' says Geri Foster, a former
teacher and the wife of a canal pilot who has lived in Panama since
1966. ``You're talking about a whole community being displaced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago, it never seemed like this was going to
happen,'' says Foster, shaking her head. ``But here we are. It went
by awfully fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The end of an era has many Americans waxing nostalgic.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wainio, a former canal commission official, calls the
former Canal Zone an example of Plato's idea of the benevolent
dictatorship. The zone was a government creation in which U.S.
bureaucrats managed everything from canal traffic to garbage
collection.

   Bill Duffus, 47, a dredge operator who retired a few months ago
and is preparing to pull out, says: ``It was a socialist
atmosphere. We had a government hospital. We saw government
doctors. We had a company store.''
</P>
<P>
   Markham, the canal's transit operations director, who is moving
to Florida later this month, agrees. ``When I came down here,'' he
says, ``we had our own schools, fire department, health clinics,
furniture stores and post office.''
</P>
<P>
   In the zone, many Americans maintain, there was no poverty
because everyone had a job.
</P>
<P>
   As he drank a bottle of beer by a boathouse on the edge of the
canal, a former Canal Zone police officer remembers that when he
was on patrol, there was little to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little larceny, a little burglary. Drugs were not
prevalent. Cocaine was nonexistent,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that most Panamanians wish the Americans
would stay put. They fear that the national economy will suffer
once the U.S. government and the American residents leave. But
others are delighted to see the Canal Zone disappear after more
than nine decades.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
END OF AN ERA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 1903 treaty between the United States and Panama established
the Canal Zone as a 10-mile-wide strip of land hugging the proposed
canal route that was to be controlled by the United States ``in
perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was also granted the right to expropriate other lands
required for the construction and operation of the waterway. Such
one-sided treaty terms later became a bone of contention for
nationalist Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, some claimed, the zone had become a racist enclave.
Retired West Indian canal workers remember the zone as a kind of
apartheid state in which neighborhoods were labeled ``gold'' and
``silver'' to distinguish between white and black areas.
</P>
<P>
   When civil rights leader Jesse Jackson toured the zone in the
1970s, he was appalled by the racial divisions. Few of the Zonians
learned Spanish and even today, some butcher the names of the towns
where they have lived for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would work here and never leave the zone,''
Markham says.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end came in 1964, when anti-American riots
broke out after students from Panama City tried to raise the
Panamanian flag next to the U.S. flag at Balboa High School.
Panama's former military ruler, Gen. Omar Torrijos, called the zone
a ``colonialist tumor'' and vowed that it would be abolished _ even
if that meant going to war.
</P>
<P>
   By negotiating the canal treaties with President Carter,
Torrijos became a national hero. But among Zonians, the two former
leaders are widely scorned for having signed away their
livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   Besides mandating the turnover of the canal, the treaties
returned jurisdiction of most of the Canal Zone to Panama in 1979
and set a schedule for the gradual drawdown of U.S. troops and the
closing of military bases.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen of his rented whitewashed bungalow near the banks
of the canal, Holden unwinds from his 14-hour day on the Konkar
Star with a glass of rum.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that U.S. control of the waterway is an anachronism.
But somehow, pulling out also feels wrong, he says.
</P>
<P>
   For veteran pilots like Holden, life on the Panama Canal was not
a job, but a calling.
</P>
<P>
   Holden and his wife, Judy, a native of New Zealand, have
reluctantly shipped some of their belongings to their house in Palm
Harbor, near St. Petersburg. But Holden refuses to leave until the
canal actually changes hands Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel like I'm ready to retire,'' he says. ``It's
like a horse with blinders. When you have a good life, you look
straight ahead, and you don't want to see it come to an end.''

<P>
   Silicon Valley's charms can quickly pall. Meeting one hairy
millionaire in cycling shorts can be diverting. Meeting a
succession leaves you pining for less repellent forms of
conformity.
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then, however, you come across someone who is
doing something genuinely wacky: such as the leader of the local
branch of the AFL-CIO, Amy Dean.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago one American worker in three was a member of a
trade union. Today the figure is closer to one in seven.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley start-ups, trade unionists are about as thick
on the ground as manual typewriters. Yet it is here that Dean is
planning the rebirth of the American labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   As Don Quixotes go, she has an impressive record. She is part of
the new labor movement: young (36, and already a five-year veteran
as head of the South Bay labor council); well-educated (a degree in
sociology and economics would have led to postgraduate work had she
not been seduced into the Ladies' Garment Workers Union); and
plugged into the new economy (her husband works for a software
start-up).
</P>
<P>
   When she took over the South Bay branch of the AFL-CIO, it was
little more than a blue-collar rest home. Now it is humming, housed
in what looks like a high-tech hatchery, staffed by bright young
things, many of them Hispanic women, and elaborately ``networked,''
along the best Silicon Valley lines.
</P>
<P>
   A sister group, Working Partnership USA, which she set up in
1995, does research, trains local activists and cultivates
relations with universities.
</P>
<P>
   Dean can sound like an academic with the gift of the gab. Do not
be deceived: she is a street fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, her organization not only trounced the bosses'
candidate in a brutal battle for a seat on the San Jose city
council. (``I was up against the single most powerful political
machine in the Valley,'' grumbled the loser.)
</P>
<P>
   It also won its campaign to force San Jose to adopt a ``living
wage'' for all municipal contractors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose now has the highest minimum wage in the country, almost
twice the mandatory level in the state of California.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the president of the AFL-CIO, John Sweeney,
recruited Dean to head a committee on the future of the labor
movement. She started by admitting what was obvious to everybody
but the movement itself: that it is on a hiding to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are still rooted in a world of vertically integrated
companies, glacial innovation and jobs for life, she says, in her
best academic tones.
</P>
<P>
   But these days firms are spinning into webs, innovation is
relentless and the average length of employment in California,
where the new economy is being forged, is three years.
</P>
<P>
   Given this, Dean is remarkably upbeat. Labor organizations are
not alone in failing to keep pace with economic change: the same
could be said of almost any public-sector institution.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing odd about unions failing in new industries:
the same was true of the infant car and electricity industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest reason for Dean's optimism is that she thinks
that the defining characteristic of the new economy _ its obsession
with flexibility _ will turn out to be a boon for unions.
</P>
<P>
   This seems counterintuitive. How can unions represent people who
might be changing job any day? And how can they recruit people who
fear that a reputation for bolshiness could stop them from getting
another job?
</P>
<P>
   The rise of temp agencies such as Manpower (which is now
America's largest employer) has coincided with the unions' decline.
</P>
<P>
   Against this, Dean points out, temporary workers are often
miserable workers. The worst-paid live a hand-to-mouth existence
without medical or other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the best-paid are fearful of the future and envious
of those on the permanent payroll, as Microsoft discovered last
month when some ``permatemps'' won a class-action suit against it.
Microsoft is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's bright idea for reaching these discontented but elusive
temps is to establish a temping agency of her own, Together &LR; Work.
</P>
<P>
   The month-old agency is not only paying its workers better than
its rivals pay theirs. It also plans to give them medical benefits,
pensions and training. (This is not as unrealistic as it sounds:
conventional agencies charge fat commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Dean wants her agency to become a stable point in lives
otherwise blown hither and thither by the flexible economy. This is
also her plan for the union movement as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As firms become more nimble, workers will have to look elsewhere
for things that make life secure, from training to medical
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century some craft unions proved so good at
providing these that they controlled the supply of workers: when
people wanted a carpenter they went to the union.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of the new economy, notably Hollywood, unions are
starting to play this role again; Dean would like it to become the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Her heady vision raises all sorts of questions. Is she really a
convert to the flexible economy? Her most concrete achievement so
far has been to make wages in San Jose more rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Can trade unions really provide training in the new economy? At
the moment, her power base is in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Dean will not make her mark. She has
proved remarkably successful at bullying San Jose politicians and
raising questions the cyber elite would rather forget, such as why
wages for the low-paid in the world's center of wealth creation are
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The discontent smoldering among permatemps could become a blaze
when the economy turns down. And if the history of Silicon Valley
teaches anything, it is never to write off people with crazy
ideas. &QL;

also her plan for the union movement as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As firms become more nimble, workers will have to look elsewhere
for things that make life secure, from training to medical
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century some craft unions proved so good at
providing these that they controlled the supply of workers: when
people wanted a carpenter they went to the union.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of the new economy, notably Hollywood, unions are
starting to play this role again; Dean would like it to become the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Her heady vision raises all sorts of questions. Is she really a
convert to the flexible economy? Her most concrete achievement so
far has been to make wages in San Jose more rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Can trade unions really provide training in the new economy? At
the moment, her power base is in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Dean will not make her mark. She has
proved remarkably successful at bullying San Jose politicians and
raising questions the cyber elite would rather forget, such as why
wages for the low-paid in the world's center of wealth creation are
falling.
</P>
<P>
   The discontent smoldering among permatemps could become a blaze
when the economy turns down. And if the history of Silicon Valley
teaches anything, it is never to write off people with crazy
ideas. &QL;

PARTY TO WATCH PIRATED `BUFFY' EVEN SCARIER THAN THE SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're sitting in a dimly lit guest house overlooking a hilly
street in a tree-lined neighborhood, and the fact that I can't say
which guest house along what hilly street in which tree-lined
neighborhood is a bit unnerving. This deal of silence was struck
before my trip here, and at one point my host wonders aloud if a
blindfold might have been necessary, delivering this comment in
complete and utter seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike'' is 16 years old and quite aware of the consequences
that come with standing up for your principles. Like going to jail,
which is a long shot; being hit with a stiff fine, which is a
remote possibility; or having Dad confiscate the shiny black
Toshiba laptop, which is highly likely.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of being able to go anywhere and do anything when
plugged in and fired up, and that's why this crowd has been
assembled here, circling him like believers around a messiah.
</P>
<P>
   The season finale of the teen drama ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
_ the one the WB network pulled because its violent story line
seemed insensitive to the families of slain Colorado students _ is
the spiritual connection. Here, it's being played out on Mike's
laptop. Small, grainy, jerky, and sounding like a transistor radio
in the middle of nowhere, the video shows Sarah Michelle Gellar's
Buffy leading the charge against a 60-foot demon who has vowed to
massacre the entire senior graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   Ooohs and aaaahs echo around me, but all I see are shadowy
figures and crackling voices.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, out of respect for a network that spent $1 million to
produce this one-hour episode, that's all you'll get out of me.
</P>
<P>
   I'd come here at Mike's request, partly to satisfy my curiosity
(like everyone else, I saw Part 1 and am experiencing Buffy
withdrawal) and also figuring it might at least make an interesting
column.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Mike is one of many savvy Internet wizards who downloaded
bootleg copies of the episode when the series aired in Canada. This
clearly constitutes copyright piracy, but because this is the
Internet, where policing is still in its infancy, who knows what
the rules are?
</P>
<P>
   Still, he declines to tell exactly how or where he got it. The
episode had been copied on Canadian television and plastered on Web
sites. Those who knew where to find it merely copied and
downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   In this two-level house, a dozen others scamper around us,
munching on doughnuts and sipping what looks like punch. All are
teen-agers, except for a guy lodged quietly on the floor in the
corner, furiously knocking down cups of coffee and tossing a Nerf
ball at a cat, which doesn't move. The guy is dressed in black
pants, shirt and baseball cap, and looks no younger than 30.
</P>
<P>
   Most are fans of ``Buffy,'' although one 16-year-old high school
girl in jeans and halter top merely claims to be a proponent of the
public's right to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's censorship,'' she says. ``You can't control what we see.
It's our decision to either watch something or not watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Halter-top girl leaves as soon as the show starts, saying,
``I've made my point.'' (There's a bizarre round of applause.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a marketing scheme,'' claims a boy in a Nike T-shirt.
``This wasn't done because they (the WB network) are responsible or
whatever. They play the first (of a two-part) episode, right? You
think people won't want to see it if they can't? ... Man, people
who ain't even seen Buffy will watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads again nod in unison at this information, and that's when I
began to move toward the door.
</P>
<P>
   I'd either stumbled into ``The Twilight Zone'' or was being
taped for ``Candid Camera.'' Either would be a humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   We do talk intelligently about the WB's decision to run the
episode over the summer, and how the Nike T-shirt guy is right
about how the audience will be far greater than what the show would
have gotten had it aired May 25.
</P>
<P>
   I leave with home phone numbers and cell-phone numbers and
beeper numbers so I can ``stay in touch with the truth,'' as one
boy, in shorts and holding a soccer ball, puts it. I get in my car
and head down this hilly street, getting the distinct feeling that
my car will explode.
</P>
<P>
   Back home safe and sound, I wonder if something deeper and more
meaningful came out of my meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Like teens and the Internet. Teens and their rebellion against
authority. Teens and their hatred for censorship. Teens and their
love for ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from sharing doughnuts with a bunch of, um, interesting
conspiracy theorists, the only revelation was that the guy in the
corner was indeed older than 30. And that cat was dead.

FILM EXPLORES THE UNEXPECTED FACETS OF CHIAPAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too sophisticated to be simply wide-eyed, not nosy enough to be
deeply probing, Nettie Wild's ``A Place Called Chiapas'' makes a
virtue of its filmmaker's innocence as she slyly, almost
manipulatively, ingratiates herself to the major players in the
notorious, ongoing Zapatista insurgence that broke out in 1994 in
southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wild, a Canadian documentarian, trekked south of the border to
have a look at the ensuing political chaos and carnage. Her manner
is that of a high school social studies teacher on an excursion
with her class in a troubled country that she falls in love with.
Her grasp of the politics and danger swelling around her ranges
from advanced placement to remedial, but ``Chiapas'' is largely
free of the didactic, discursive academics that relegate lots of
uprising documentaries to History Channel pomposity: It's electric,
alive and commendably, coincidentally surreal.
</P>
<P>
   What seems potentially fraught with condescension _ a white lady
lugging her cameras and crew to Mexico to capture the truth about
Mexico's showdown between its indigenous people and its government
_ is actually a humorous, awkward, imperiled cat's cradle of
history, fury and injustice made occasionally lucid.
</P>
<P>
   What Wild manages to do is check hard-boiled journalistic
chutzpah at the border and just be a terribly concerned filmmaker,
crew in tow. Without feigning empathy or deigning to be ``one of
you,'' Wild films intimate moments with the major players in a
battle for the loss of property control.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's handling of the Zapatista uprising also
happens to have the uncanny literariness of a sign-laden novella,
with Wild as its sort of Alice _ shrinking, shrinking, shrinking
into the tense, occasionally, bizarrely magic- kissed landscape of
this incensing wonderland.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas themselves are a band of ambiguous, approachable
men who quote Brecht and sport wool pull-over facemasks and whose
leader is a figure called Subcommander Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   A post-industrial, ultra-liberal political organization, the
Zapatistas exist in large part on the Web, publishing manifestoes,
essays, photos and news briefs, hoping to educate the world about
the contradictions mounting since 1994 when the Mexican government
complied with the ominous tenets of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But what the film reveals is that the Zapatistas are also a
one-size-fits-all outfit of post-modern superheroes, for whom
individual identity is irrelevant and their agenda is their power
because, beyond the Internet, they have no agency.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Marcos exudes a dangerous charisma from behind his mask
that manages to capture the world's attention, as he becomes the
faceless, generic model for his cause. In one throwaway hilarious
scene, Marie Claire sends a writer and a crew to the South Mexico
jungle for a must-have story and photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Marcos is hot and the Zapatista movement is a
cumbersome cause celebre in the international media, which are
willing to whore for Marcos if for no other reason than that Marcos
doesn't mind pimping Zapatista concerns and his anonymous image for
them.
</P>
<P>
   His media saturation rankles and worries some of his supporters,
who fear, and suffer at the hands of, an irate Mexican government.
He and Wild forge a fascinating, dare-I-say romantic rapport as she
is told stories of his legendary status and he risks credibility to
speak with her. Though she remains off-camera for most of the film,
the two have a question-and-answer relationship predicated upon her
roughing-it outsider status and his suave, elusive stardom.
</P>
<P>
   If a major studio ever chooses to fictionalize ``Chiapas,''
their love would be a concoction heaving between ``Mahogany'' and
``Doctor Zhivago.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Wild goes astray is in her eloquent, poetic narration of
people, circumstances and events. Her words have the lugubrious
richness and edifying tactility of NPR reportage _ descriptive in a
way that, were you to close your eyes, you could see, and feel, the
world she was conjuring through her airwave microphones. As the
supplementary component of ``Chiapas,'' her voice-over needlessly
reiterates what unfolds before her cameras, which are handled with
alert attention to beautiful inertia and capricious action by Wild
and Kirk Tougas.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the film, Wild finds stirring, bold ways of
showing unexpected sides of a story that sometimes has the
transcendent urgency of a luscious and troubled agitprop fable.

NEWS FLASH: ANCHORWOMAN WAS A PLAYER ON THE PAGEANT CIRCUIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first and last time Lauren Green would play piano
on national television, something was missing _ something very
close to her.
</P>
<P>
   It was during the final round of the 1985 Miss America Pageant.
Green had just zipped off the runway in her swimsuit and had
moments to dress for the talent competition. Too few moments,
unfortunately: When she took a seat at the piano bench, there was
nothing between Green and several layers of scratchy tulle.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Green, Miss Minnesota, was named third runner-up,
and her final-round performance actually came off much better than
the preliminary round, when nerves sabotaged her Chopin. That
experience shook the pianist to the core, and Green, now a New York
City television news anchor, still approaches public performances
with a bit of dread.
</P>
<P>
   So why put herself through it again by playing, as she did
Thursday night, in the Cliburn-sponsored International Piano
Competition for Outstanding Amateurs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride, I think,'' said Green, 40. ``For all of us (in the
competition), we're very hard workers, very tenacious, and you just
don't fool around at anything. You achieve a certain level of
excellence in a certain area and you transfer that to every other
endeavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Green has been with Fox News in New York since 1996, where she
anchors a dozen news updates between 9 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. weekdays.
As an arts and entertainment correspondent, she has interviewed,
among others, Placido Domingo and Denyce Graves, whose picture
hangs above her almost empty desk. (Green swears her office was far
messier before a recent major cleanup.)
</P>
<P>
   In a bright red suit and black pumps, Green is undeniably
striking and intimidatingly tall. As she talks, she pulls off the
heels and replaces them with a pair of hot pink socks and worn
sneakers. Her exercise routine consists of the 40-minute walk she
takes each weekday to her West End apartment from work. It's about
all she can fit into a day that has recently required up to four
hours in front of the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Green grew up in Minneapolis, the youngest of five
children. Her oldest sibling, a sister who is also an accomplished
pianist, is 17 years her senior. On a recent weekday, her brother
Ken, a Minneapolis-based painter, was waiting at the Fox News
studios on 46th Street to take her to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Green took her first piano lessons at age 6 and began studying
in earnest at 10. Her mother played; their upright piano had
belonged to her grandmother. ``I didn't know anything different
than having a piano in the house,'' Green said. ``I thought it was
standard furniture, like having a couch.''
</P>
<P>
   After her junior year in high school, Green was one of four
pianists invited to the High School Musicians Project at the
University of Minnesota. She eventually majored in music there, but
had set her sights on acting. She headed for Los Angeles
immediately after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I soon found out that I really just cannot act,'' she admitted
recently. But modeling was another story. Green, who had entered
pageants as a teen, began doing so again. She won Miss Bloomington
(Minn.). She won Miss Twin Cities. She won Miss Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Green's success in the Miss America Pageant led to an internship
at a news station in Minneapolis _ which led to graduate school in
journalism at Northwestern University, which led to jobs in Chicago
and then New York.
</P>
<P>
   Piano has remained a part of her life throughout, though at
times she regrets taking to heart the opinion of a college piano
teacher who told her she didn't have the talent to pursue music
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Green played a duet with Daniel Barenboim of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra for a school project. Barenboim
complimented her playing, and Green says she realized then just how
much damage one negative comment can do.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks back, Green called another competitor in New York in
a slight panic. ``I don't know if I can do this,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   But the paralyzing doubts have passed. ``It's not about
winning,'' Green told herself, and still believes. No matter what
happens in Fort Worth, ``I still have a life, a job, an apartment,
a future.''
</P>
<P>
   And time to dress completely before each round.
</P>

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Modern Farmers Mart
 &HT;    Buying flowers online may be nothing new to you, but now
Ecuadorean and Colombian flower growers, suppliers of 60 percent of
the US$15 billion U.S. fresh-cut flower market, can now sell their
flowers online, too.
 &HT;    World Commerce Online has created Floraplex, an electronic
market that allows farmers to bypass the network of more than 100
Miami brokers that control the flow of Latin American flowers.
Under the Orlando, Florida-based company's plan, growers and
retailers will meet in cyberspace to bid and fill orders just as
consumers are doing on auction sites like popular eBay. Payments
will be processed electronically. ``Even if (the grower didn't save
any money, the program is worth it just because the flowers arrive
faster and fresher,'' says World Commerce Online CEO Bob Shaw.
 &HT;    InfoFlora, a Bogota-based company that works with more than 90
growers in Colombia, is sold on the concept. ``Growers for the
first time in history will find a way to guarantee their
payments,'' says Diego Botero, president of InfoFlora and the local
Floraplex representative. They also stand to reap greater profits
because the Miami brokers charge an average 22 percent commission
on every deal they close. Floraplex will charge 3 percent to 8
percent depending on each order's volume, while buyers and sellers
will agree among themselves on price, volume and delivery date.
 &HT;    Shaw claims Floraplex is a win-win situation for both ends of
the business, though the middlemen may find themselves looking for
a new line of work. Most at risk are the smaller distributors who
do not own their own flower farms. ``We are linking producer to
consumer, just like it was done 100 years ago when any farmer
harvested his crop, loaded up his wagon and took it to town,'' says
Shaw, who hopes to expand his service to other industries and
regions. ``The Internet is the modern-day farmers cart.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cashing In On Convenience
 &HT;    Forget the traffic. Forget finding a parking space. Forget the
long lines and all the other headaches of going to a bank in Mexico
City. Banco IXE, Mexico's virtual bank, is well on its way to
fulfilling its slogan as the ``bank of convenience.''
 &HT;    Since launching services three years ago, the bank boasts 30,000
clients and assets topping US$320 million. Banco IXE relies on a
unique mix of the Internet, telephone and courier service to offer
flexibility on how, when and where clients do their banking. On
average, such convenience is attracting 40 new clients each day.
 &HT;    IXE singled out working professionals for its checking, savings
and investment accounts because Mexico's household computer
penetration is quite small. However, says Raul Triay, director of
electronic banking and product development at IXE, most
white-collar workers have access to computers and the Internet at
their desks. Only about a tenth of account holders rely solely on
Internet banking, but that segment is growing the fastest.
 &HT;    With rising popularity, competition in Internet banking services
is heating up, with both Banamex, one of the nation's largest
banks, and mid-sized Bital offering rival services. But, says
Triay, ``we have a very targeted market focus. We are not after
every bank account. At most banks in Mexico, a person can open an
account with a few hundred pesos. The minimum required deposit for
banking with us is 20,000 pesos (US$2,000).''
 &HT;    The nascent network cost over $10 million to build. Starting
from scratch had its advantages. ``Many of the larger Mexican banks
have thousands of branches, with different information technology
systems,'' says Triay. ``Creating an integrated Internet banking
service for them is far more complex and costly.'' IXE's passes the
savings derived from its electronic network to customers in the
form of reduced fees for investing in money market funds _ the
bank's main product.
 &HT;    Internet banking is not without its dark moments. IXE has no
control over how Internet users get to the bank, with connections
sometimes being routed through Hong Kong and other far away places,
slowing down transaction speed and irritating clients. Services for
small and medium-sized firms are in the works, as well as
broadening the bank's reach beyond the capital to the rest of the
country and across national borders. The web sites design is
undergoing changes to meet needs peculiar to Mexican businesses,
like multiple authorizations on checks and transfers.
 &HT;    The virtual bank has also decided that it could use some bricks
and mortar. ``While the Internet has its advantages, practically
speaking, an individual cannot receive money via the Internet,''
says Triay. ``Hence, we needed a few branches.'' IXE has opened 14
offices in Mexico City, a rep office in Monterrey and plans to open
two branches in Leon, a city northwest of the capital. But, offices
and bank tellers aside, the horizon for expansion is wholly online.

 &HT;    La Carreta Electronica
 &HT;    Comprar flores en linea quiza no sea nuevo para usted, pero
ahora los cultivadores de flores de Ecuador y Colombia, que
abastecen el 60 por ciento del mercado de flores frescas de Estados
Unidos, con un valor de US$15.000 millones, tambien pueden vender
en la Internet.
 &HT;    World Commerce Online ha creado Floraplex, un mercado
electronico que permite a los cultivadores soslayar la red de mas
de 100 intermediarios de Miami que controlan la entrada de flores
desde America Latina. Bajo el plan de la compania, radicada en
Orlando, Florida, los cultivadores y los vendedores minoristas se
reuniran en el ciberespacio para hacer licitaciones y despachar
pedidos, del mismo modo que hacen los consumidores en paginas de
subasta como la popular eBay. Los pagos se procesaran
electronicamente. ``Aunque (el cultivador no haya ahorrado nada, el
programa vale la pena porque las flores llegan con mas rapidez y
mas frescas,'' dice Bob Shaw, presidente ejecutivo de World
Commerce Online.
 &HT;    InfoFlora, una compania de Bogota que trabaja con mas de 90
cultivadores colombianos, adopto el concepto. ``Por primera vez en
la historia, los cultivadores tendran una forma de garantizar sus
pagos,'' dice Diego Botero, presidente de InfoFlora y representante
de Floraplex. Tambien tendran mayores ganancias porque los
intermediarios de Miami cobran en promedio una comision del 22 por
ciento por cada negocio. Floraplex tambien cobrara del 3 por ciento
al 8 por ciento, dependiendo del volumen de cada pedido, mientras
los compradores y los vendedores acordaran entre ellos el precio,
el volumen y la fecha de entrega.
 &HT;    Shaw afirma que en Floraplex ganan todas las partes del negocio,
aunque es posible que los intermediarios tengan que buscar otro
trabajo. Los que mas peligro corren son los distribuidores pequenos
que no tienen terrenos de cultivo de flores. ``Estamos vinculando
al productor con el consumidor, de la misma forma que hace 100
anos, cuando los campesinos recogian la cosecha, la cargaban en una
carreta y la llevaban al pueblo,'' dice Shaw, que espera ampliar su
servicio a otros sectores y regiones. ``La Internet es la carreta
del campesino moderno.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Un Banco Que Da la Cara
 &HT;    Olvidense del trafico, del estacionamiento, de las colas y otras
molestias de ir a un banco en esta capital. IXE Banco, el banco
virtual de Mexico, esta muy cerca de ser lo que proclama: ``el
banco de la conveniencia.'' Ixe es una palabra nahuatl que
significa ``el que da la cara y cumple con su palabra,'' segun la
pagina electronica de la entidad.
 &HT;    Desde que inicio el servicio hace tres anos, el banco ha ganado
30.000 clientes y sus activos superan los US$320 millones. IXE
Banco emplea una combinacion unica de Internet, telefonia y
mensajeria para ofrecer sus servicios a cualquier hora y en
cualquier lugar, lo que le gana unos 40 clientes nuevos cada dia.
 &HT;    Para aumentar sus cuentas corrientes, de ahorros e inversion,
IXE apunto al sector profesional porque en Mexico todavia no se
usan muchas computadoras en casa. Sin embargo, dice Raul Triay,
director de banca electronica y desarrollo de productos en IXE, la
mayoria de los profesionales tienen acceso a una PC y a la
Internet. Solo la decima parte de los cuentahabientes usa la banca
en la Internet, pero ese segmento es el que crece con mas rapidez.
 &HT;    Debido a su popularidad, la competencia entre los servicios
bancarios en la Internet se hace mas renida. Banamex, uno de los
mayores bancos de Mexico, y Bital, mediano, ofrecen servicios
rivales. Pero, dice Triay, ``apuntamos a un sector muy especifico
del mercado. No buscamos cualquier cuenta bancaria. En la mayoria
de los bancos mexicanos, se puede abrir una cuenta con unos cientos
de pesos. El deposito minimo que requerimos es de 20.000 pesos
[US$2.000.''
 &HT;    Construir la red costo mas de US$10 millones. Pero partir de
cero tiene sus ventajas. ``Muchos bancos mexicanos grandes tienen
miles de sucursales, con distintos sistemas informaticos,'' dice
Triay. ``Para ellos es mucho mas complejo y costoso crear un
servicio bancario integrado en la Internet.'' IXE pasa los ahorros
a sus clientes, reduciendo las cuotas que cobra por las inversiones
en el mercado monetario, su producto principal.
 &HT;    La banca en la Internet no esta exenta de contratiempos. IXE no
puede controlar como los usuarios entran al banco, con conexiones
que a veces pasan a traves de Hong Kong y otros lugares, que
retrasan las transacciones e irritan a los clientes. Pero el banco
afirma que en general los clientes estan contentos y que recibe muy
pocas quejas.
 &HT;    En proceso de preparacion estan los servicios para firmas
pequenas y medianas, asi como la ampliacion del banco hacia el
resto del pais y a nivel internacional. El diseno de la pagina de
la Web se cambia para responder a las necesidades peculiares de los
negocios mexicanos, como las autorizaciones multiples a cheques y
transferencias. El banco virtual tambien ha decidido tener una
presencia en el mundo fisico.
 &HT;    ``Aunque la Internet tiene sus ventajas, no se puede recibir
dinero a traves de la Internet,'' dice Triay. ``Por lo tanto,

COREL'S OFFICE SUITE A TOUGH COMPETITOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe the conventional wisdom, then the office suite
war _ like the operating system war and the browser war _ is over,
and Microsoft has won. But a funny thing happened while Bill Gates
&AMP; Co. were celebrating another victory.
</P>
<P>
   Corel Corp. has just released the slickest version yet of its
office suite. WordPerfect Office 2000 Professional nearly matches
Microsoft's latest entry, Office 2000, feature for feature, and
certainly beats it in one key area: the price.
</P>
<P>
   While WordPerfect may never dominate the office productivity
market like its DOS-based word processor once did, this new version
will do a lot to hold the line against the Microsoft onslaught, and
may win back some who've strayed from the fold.
</P>
<P>
   First, the obligatory caveat: My name is Dwight, and I am a
WordPerfect user. I've used it since DOS version 4.2, and I still
find it to be easier to use and more intuitive than Word. However,
I prefer the other components of Microsoft Office, particularly
PowerPoint and Excel, to the other applications in Corel's suite.
</P>
<P>
   Previous versions of the WordPerfect suite suffered from a
varied lineage. The Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database,
for example, came from Borland. As a result, the look and feel of
the programs were not always homogeneous.
</P>
<P>
   That's been dramatically fixed with the 2000 version. The
primary applications finally feel like they are part of a cohesive
package.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A SLEW OF APPLICATIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along with WordPerfect, Quattro Pro and Paradox, Office 2000
Professional comes with a slew of other applications. They include
Trellix 2.0, a program designed for creating documents to be used
online; Corel Print Office, for specialized printing and graphics
projects; NetPerfect, an HTML conversion program; and Dragon
NaturallySpeaking 3.0, for voice recognition.
</P>
<P>
   That last component is a key differentiator difference between
the Corel and Microsoft products. Corel is aggressively touting
voice recognition as a key part of its top-of-the-line office
suite. Yet, even though Microsoft has a close relationship with
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, one of the premier makers of voice-recognition
software, that feature is nowhere to be found in its Office 2000
suite.
</P>
<P>
   WordPerfect Office 2000 Professional, as with the Microsoft
product, has a handy feature that lets you install only the options
you need for each application. This is good, because the
``typical'' installation is almost 300 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   With this feature, called Install-As-You-Go, only the most-used
options are placed on your hard drive. However, all the possible
options are available via the menus. If you try to use a feature
that's not installed, you're prompted for the CD. Or, if
WordPerfect Office is installed via a network, the component can be
pulled off a server.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that the main programs in this suite are lean
and mean. WordPerfect in particular remains a hog of memory and
Windows resources _ but it's better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the program launches faster, loads documents faster,
saves files faster and converts between formats faster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CONVERSIONS IMPROVED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It also does a much better job of converting to Microsoft Office
file formats. Previous versions of WordPerfect and Quattro Pro did
a less-than-stellar job of converting to Word and Excel, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   I tried converting a variety of spreadsheet, word processing and
presentation documents. The spreadsheet and word processing files
converted flawlessly every time, and I found only minor, easily
corrected animation glitches with the presentation documents.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new features I like the best in the WordPerfect Suite
is called the Real Time Preview. As you make various changes _ font
types, margins, backgrounds, etc. _ you're shown how the document
will look before you lock in the formatting. For folks who don't
consider themselves whizzes at document design, it's a godsend. You
can see what works and what doesn't in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Corel got its start as a graphics application company, and that
strength has finally shown up in the suite. Yes, the Professional
edition comes with the aforementioned Corel Print Office, but more
importantly the built-in graphics components of the applications
have been beefed up.
</P>
<P>
   For example, WordPerfect, Quattro Pro and Presentations all come
with the ability to search through an on-disk library for specific
images, displaying the results as thumbnails in a feature called
the Scrapbook. If you work with a lot of clip art, it eliminates
the need for a separate media-management program.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that both the Microsoft and Corel suites do is try to
make it easier to save documents as HTML files for use on the Web.
Microsoft has the edge here; it's built into each component
program. While the Corel programs will save as HTML, it's not a
perfect conversion. The NetPerfect program that comes with
WordPerfect Suite 2000 is designed for just-right conversions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Corel have several different configurations for
their suites, and doing an apples-to-apples price comparison of the
two up and down the line can be tough. But if you look at the
high-end versions _ Microsoft Office 2000 Premium and WordPerfect
Office 2000 Professional _ you'll see that the WordPerfect package
is a better buy. First-time users pay $499 for WordPerfect,
compared to $799 for the Microsoft product. Those who are upgrading
from a previous version pay $209 for WordPerfect vs. $449 for
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, I'll take a detailed look at Microsoft Office 2000
Premium.

IS AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES NECESSARILY BAD FOR STOCKS?  
  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (jt)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bombs stopped falling on Kosovo last week. Japan's economy
recorded its first growth in 18 months in the first quarter.
Germany's industrial output is quickening, and its unemployment
rate is falling. Yet the markets persist in brooding about the
prospect of a modest hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Recent price moves suggest that the bond market is convinced the
Fed will raise rates. Partly in sympathy, stock measures like the
Dow Jones industrial average have slipped 5 percent or more from
their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, however, that an increase in interest rates
would be unremittingly bad for stocks. Robert Heisterberg, a senior
vice president and chairman of the asset allocation committee of
Alliance Capital Management, took some time last week to discuss
that proposition. Here are some excerpts: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Market interest rates have risen much more sharply
from their troughs than they did in 1994 and 1997, the last two
periods when the Fed tightened monetary policy. Has the increase
been justified?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The bond market overshot by about 50 basis points on the
downside last fall, because everything conspired to create a set of
expectations that, in a medium-term sense, led people to believe we
were about to enter a recession, if not a depression.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of cyclical factors, I would trace the rise we have
seen from a level of about 5 percent or 5.25 percent on the 30-year
Treasury bond. That backup has been warranted. The American economy
has continued to grow, and now we are seeing signs of growth
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The news out of Japan is important. If they can sustain positive
economic growth, it will do a lot for the Asian region and for the
world economy. If others pitch in, it means America doesn't have to
as much. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)In response to the crisis last year, the Fed cut
short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point
in a matter of weeks. Will it take back all of those cuts?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would be surprised if they will be required to take back
all of the 75 basis points they eased last year. However, I am
quite confident they will take back one-quarter of a percentage
point. At this point, it's a 50-50 proposition they will raise
rates by another one-quarter of a point after that. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why do you think they will stop short of taking more
dramatic action?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The fundamentals of inflation are still performing quite
well. Inflation becomes a problem when it begins to influence
decisions. When I start to see companies and consumers making
decisions based on concern over rising prices, that is when I start
to get concerned. I haven't seen that. Also, I think we will get
some slowing in the economy during the second half of the year. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Does the increase in interest rates we have seen,
and may yet see, pose a significant threat to stocks?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Valuation levels right now are fairly lofty, and that makes
stocks more vulnerable. But to say that interest rates are going to
unglue this market is probably an overstatement. To make a strong
negative case for stocks relative to interest rates, you would have
to see rates go up considerably more than they have. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Money is getting drained out of stocks that are
viewed to be vulnerable to rising interest rates, like technology
and financial services. But some of these companies performed quite
nicely when rates were higher than they are now. What is your
view?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. A resumption of growth outside the United States has to be
good news for multinationals and a number of technology companies,
as well as some less exotic machinery manufacturers and capital
goods makers. A good number of these companies were hurt by
contraction in consumption spending in Latin America and Asia, and
some were just shut off by the recession outside the United States,
especially in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view is that rising interest rates hurt banks
and financial stocks. But most of these companies, if you study

is not sensitive to interest rates at all. Generally speaking, we
think the valuations in this area reflect the old view about their
vulnerability to interest rates, and not the new reality. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A. In terms of allocation, we are closer to our long-term
benchmarks now than we were a few months ago, but that is because,
due to superior performance, we took some money out of the equity
market.
</P>
<P>
   Our allocation for growth-investor accounts is about 70 percent
in equities, about 24 percent in bonds and the remainder in cash.
We are modestly overweighted internationally, and our domestic
equity positions are skewed toward a somewhat broader list of
stocks than the large-cap growth stocks that have been driving the
market. The market has broadened dramatically, and we have had to
respond to that.  &QL;

BUSH HEADS TO THE HEARTLAND TO TEST HIS CAMPAIGN METTLE

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush plans to leave Texas
Saturday to attend a couple of barbecues, shake some hands and meet
a few people. No big deal really.
</P>
<P>
   Only the nation will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   After months of staying home tending to legislative business and
boning up on world and national affairs, the son of former
President George Bush will hit the campaign trail on a whirlwind,
four-day trip to Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he was eager to go ``look people in the eye
and hear what they have to say,'' even though he has done amazingly
well so far running his race from the ``Yellow Rose Garden'' in
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, both in the polls and in raising money.
</P>
<P>
   His first stops are in states that can make or break a would-be
president. Iowa hosts the first caucuses, and New Hampshire is home
to the first primary. Voters in both states are used to attention
from presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of holding cozy meet-and-greet sessions, Bush will
make a grand debut under the harsh glare of the national news
media.
</P>
<P>
   A crowded field of GOP opponents, struggling to raise money and
get attention, are anticipating Bush's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the candidates are ready for the sphinx finally to
speak,'' said Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at
Drake University in Des Moines. ``They'll be glad to try and scuff
him up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign trip has all the elements of a Cinderella story or
the voyage of the Titanic, depending on how they're mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolutely clear slate with the guy at this point,''
said New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett. ``But you can't come here
and please all the people. It will be interesting to see what
things bother certain people. It will be interesting to see how he
does here, to see if he gets it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tremendous expectations,'' Bennett added.
</P>
<P>
   Goldford noted that being on top is a mixed blessing. It's not
news if you do well, it's expected. It's big news if you stumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations could get out of control,'' Goldford said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was under a self-imposed moratorium on traveling until the
Texas legislative session ended May 31. During the session, he
stayed in Austin, but advisers and contributors came to him to talk
strategy and develop an agenda that he has yet to lay out.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush insists he is only ``testing the waters'' for a
possible White House bid, there is little doubt he will run for the
GOP nomination. An announcement is expected later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Goldford said Bush needs to do several things on his first trip
to the nation's heartland: Give Iowans a clear reason he wants to
run and tell them what he would do as president. And, he said, the
Texas governor needs to shore up support among social
conservatives, the best-organized group in the Republican caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to come in here and energize his supporters,''
Goldford said.
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes, people want a candidate to win because they support
him. But Goldford said that in Bush's case, many people back him
because they think he's the one who can win back the White House
for the Republicans after an eight-year shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has got to get people who'll be ready to walk through
fire for him,'' Goldford said, adding that other candidates already
have stalwarts in their Iowa organizations. ``A lot of people are
with him because things are thick, but he's got to be sure they'll
be with him when things are thin.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Bennett already sees a potential problem with
Bush's agenda because many of the events are closed to the public.
And in that state, people pay great attention to such slights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inability to meet with real voters is a problem
sometimes,'' Bennett said. ``It's truly retail campaigning here.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, with a population of 1.2 million, thrives on
representative government. The state House has 400 members, and
local governmental decisions are hashed out in small, town hall
meetings. Voters and presidential candidates often meet in livings
rooms. Residents ask hard questions and expect honest answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates have to be accessible,'' Bennett said. Those who
don't risk a poor showing in the first presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stumping in Iowa and New Hampshire, Bush and his
wife Laura will visit his father and mother at the family vacation
home in Kennebunkport, Maine, and the Texas governor will meet with
Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, a friend and supporter, in Boston
on Tuesday.

ALBRIGHT MEETS REFUGEES FOR FIRST TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
had made the return of Kosovo Albanian refugees the major mission
of the conflict with Yugoslavia, met them face to face for the
first time Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She hugged some, shook hands and, as she passed along a rope
line that held back exuberant crowds, shouted, ``You'll be going
home!''
</P>
<P>
   When her trip here was planned, it was far from clear that the
war that Albright had pressed for would be over. For the secretary
of state, the half-hour visit was the vindication that top
officials, whose policy has been questioned and even skewered in
some quarters, savor far beyond the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fought this war so that you, the refugees, could go
home,'' she told a crowd of barefoot children and roughly dressed
men and women who had struggled over the border to escape the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Now she reassured them. ``Milosevic and the Serbs have lost
control over Kosovo,'' Albright said. ``You will go home and be
able to live a decent normal life and do it your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Six miles outside this capital, the Stenkovac 1 camp, run by
Catholic Relief Services and host to 20,000 refugees, has been the
most popular stopping point for politicians and other figures since
it was set up in the days after the airstrikes began. Hillary
Rodham Clinton was here last month, along with Richard Gere, the
movie star; Elie Wiesel, the writer, and Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who as a child was twice a refugee from
Czechoslovakia, seemed to find empathy with the families who are
living in tents, their belongings scattered on the ground. As she
walked around the area, families told her of their wish to return
home as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, she sat on a plastic lawn chair in a tent with an
ethnic Albanian mother and urged her to be careful as she returned
to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs have planted mines, Albright said, and families
should be patient and take their time until the international
security force had cleared the mines. She has already cautioned
that winter might fall before all the refugees have safely returned
to their homes and that preparations had to be made to winterize
their tents.
</P>
<P>
   In another tent, Albright heard about the desire for revenge
against the Serbs that many ethnic Albanians say they feel. ``The
Serbian people are troublemakers,'' Tahir Shelova, 39, said. ``They
must pay for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also addressed several hundred American troops Friday,
another of her favorite constituencies during the war. The
secretary often praised the valor of American pilots who flew over
Yugoslavia. The forces assembled in a tent were part of an advance
guard of the 7,000-member American contingent that is preparing to
enter Kosovo with French, British and other NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told the troops that they were embarking on a
distinctive mission. ``This is a part of the world,'' she said,
``where World War I started, a lot of World War II was fought, and
you are bringing in a new history, a history where the people of
Kosovo will be able to go home in freedom in accord with the way
they want to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission, she added, will be uplifting. ``I believe this is
what America is good at,'' Albright said, ``helping other
countries. People will greet you with open arms.''

INDIANS' LAWSUIT ACCUSES U.S. OF MISPLACING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elouise Cobell won a $310,000 ``genius grant'' from
the MacArthur Foundation for her savvy banking skills, but even she
can't figure out how much money the U.S. government owes her and
hundreds of thousands of other Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at least in the billions, possibly in the tens of
billions,'' says Cobell, who looks like a banker with her dark blue
suit and glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Cobell, 53, a member of the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, is suing
the federal government for alleged mishandling of Indian trust
funds. The class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of more than
300,000 Indians and 2,000 tribes wants the government to repair the
trust system and make up for what the plaintiffs claim are billions
of dollars in underpayments.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to trial last week with the government
acknowledging that it had made a mess of the trust accounts and had
inadequately controlled receipts and disbursements and failed to
provide regular reports to account holders.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyer Tom Clark said the government was
``doing what it could'' to solve the problem and that it was not
guilty of breaking its trust relationship with the Indians and the
tribes.
</P>
<P>
   But Thaddeus Hold, attorney for the Indian plaintiffs, told the
court that the mismanagement of the accounts was ``one more example
of the breaches of faith with the original inhabitants of this
land.''
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds were created in the 19th century when it was
national policy to break up reservations and parcel out tracts of
80 or 160 acres to individual Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those lands were rich in oil, timber, minerals or
agricultural products. The government, acting as a trustee for
individual Indians, negotiated the sale of oil, trees, ore or
crops, and then collected the money on behalf of the property
owner. The government was supposed to manage this task like a trust
officer at a local bank, always acting on behalf of the landholder.
</P>
<P>
   But for Cobell and other Indians, the government has proved less
than trustworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the government's mismanagement, thousands of Indians
who literally need the money from their trust accounts to feed
their families are not seeing a dime,'' says the soft-spoken
Cobell, who was awarded the MacArthur grant for her work in helping
to create the Blackfeet National Bank in Browning, Mont., in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Interior Department report showed that more than 123,000
of the 340,000 individual Indian trust fund accounts lack a Social
Security number or taxpayer ID number. At least 46,000 accounts are
being held for Indians whose whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In tens of thousands of cases, trust fund documents were shoved
into unmarked boxes and stored in barns or sheds, according to the
Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, many of the documents were lost or
destroyed. One neglected warehouse in Albuquerque, N.M., eventually
became so rat-infested that officials entering the building in
search of trust documents needed to wear astronaut-style suits to
protect them from rat-borne diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several billion dollars may have been lost over the
years in undervalued and uncollected lease payments and in
destroyed or lost checks for Indian beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person working in a bank had done even a fraction of what
the government has done, they would be in jail,'' says Cobell.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 report for Interior Department by the consulting firm
Arthur Andersen said the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a branch of the
Interior Department that oversees the trust accounts, couldn't
document $2.4 billion in tribal trust fund transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, another report for the department by the
consulting firm Griffin &AMP; Associates warned that trust fund
problems and the Cobell lawsuit ``may result in a potential
liability to the federal government so large that it is not
reasonably estimable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Gingold, a lawyer for Cobell and four other plaintiffs,
said his clients' own preliminary estimate by the Price Waterhouse
accounting firm shows that the Indians are owed at least $10
billion _ far exceeding the Interior Department's entire annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Interior Department say they are trying to
straighten out the trust fund problems, which they say go back 100
years, and to recover all missing documents.
</P>
<P>
   However, last February, the judge presiding over Cobell's case
disagreed and found Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt and
Secretary of Treasury Robert E. Rubin in contempt for failing to
provide required materials to lawyers for the Indians in what he
called a ``campaign of stonewalling and strained interpretations''
of court orders. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth has set a
hearing on the contempt charges for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The government ``engaged in a shocking pattern of deception of
the court,'' Lamberth said. ``I have never seen more egregious
misconduct by the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobell points to her own case as an example of the difficulties
Indians face in trying to determine what land they own and how much
it is worth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Cobell's father died. Sixteen years passed before the
BIA finished her father's probate _ a delay that Cobell only
discovered after she filed her lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crazy as it sounds, I still don't know completely the types of
land I own,'' she says. ``It's frightening to think how much money
has been lost and how much damage it has done to people who are
struggling just to survive.''

<P>
   Q. After 15 years of working in sales and marketing for a
Fortune 100 company, I need to make a change. I will most likely
seek a position in a similar field, but first I need a break from
the pressure. I have all but decided to quit my job and take a
two-month respite. But if I do so, how much more difficult will it
be to find another job? And how can I improve my chances?  &QL; 
 &QL; 
A. Even in a strong economy, getting a new job is easier when you
already have one. Proving that a resignation was entirely voluntary
can be tough; some old-school employers still view any gap in your
employment record as a warning flag, said Edward D. Hendricks, a
management consultant in Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dropping out of the rat race, consider moving into
the slow lane. Many companies grant sabbaticals. You might try
finding part-time consulting work, suggested Ruth J. Luban, a
career counselor in Laguna Beach, Calif. In some cases, she added,
you can even work as a consultant to the very company that you're
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If consulting seems too daunting, think about going back to
school, Hendricks said. Pick a topic or two that captures your
interest and has practical applications in your field. Consider
courses in Web design, for example, or in information technology
advances. ``Look for something that a new prospective employer
would see as valuable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still too much pressure? You could try developing your own
informal (and low-key) learning regimen. Many of us have stacks of
new computer software or industry-related reading that we'd like to
go through, Ms. Luban said. Catching up on changes in your field _
and related fields _ can improve your prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drawbacks of an extended break, it can put you in a
much better frame of mind for job-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burnout so erodes your energy and self-concept that you're
only 50 percent available to go out and sell yourself,'' Ms. Luban
said. By recharging and rediscovering your passion for your work,
you can make a much better impression than if you go to interviews
when you're ``fried and tired,'' as she put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing with burnout is that it does not go away by
itself,'' she said. And it will only get worse if you jump directly
into another high-impact job.
</P>
<P>
   When you start looking for a new position, don't be defensive
about taking a break. ``De-emphasize the time out,'' Ms. Luban
said. ``Go in really pushing that you're the right person for the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   If _ or, more likely, when _ an interviewer raises the issue,
``lead with a positive, pro-active spin and explain the reasons why
your time off was so productive,'' she said. Especially in today's
tight labor market, many employers may be more interested in your
abilities and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the right skill set,'' she said, ``you're going to
land somewhere fairly soon.''

 &HT;    HOUSE BACKS DOWN ON BIGGER ALLOWANCES FOR MEMBERS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 13.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For a few hours late Thursday night, the House of
Representatives nearly erupted over one of the touchiest issues in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress prepared to trim back education, veterans, and
housing programs, the House was considering a bill that would have
raised the allowances for running members' offices by 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the shouting was over, rebel conservatives led by
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., had prevailed. The House agreed by voice
vote to roll back the raise and keep the allowance at its current
$385 million total.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell the public how we can increase the spending
for running our house and then ask everybody else to take a cut,''
Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote averted certain lambasting by watchdog groups.
``Frugality begins at home, and so members of Congress ought to
spend the public dollar wisely,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of the
Congressional Accountability Project, part of Ralph Nader's
consumer advocacy network.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, members have difficulty hiding their expenses, since
most of them are required to be listed on quarterly reports, which
in the coming months are scheduled to be posted on the Internet for
anyone to examine.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 70 percent of the funds go for paying staff in
both their Washington and district offices.
</P>
<P>
   Here are illustrations of how members spend the rest of their
allotments:
</P>
<P>
   _ From his 24-county district including Augusta, Ga., Rep.
Charlie Norwood, R, urges less government, but he uses every penny
allotted him for his office operations. His top aide, John Walker,
said the aim is to deploy aides to help constituents fight the
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood ranked as the seventh biggest spender on his office in a
study released this spring by the National Taxpayers Union. Norwood
also is among the most frequent users of ``franked'' mail,
newsletters that carry the member's signature in place of a stamp
and a popular way to keep in touch with the folks at home. During
the election year of 1998, he spent nearly $124,000 on mailings,
13.9 percent of his office cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, uses part of his funds in pursuit of
his intense interest in famines worldwide. Two of his 17 aides are
assigned fulltime to researching hunger. An examination of his
mundane office purchases of supplies, computers and other items
turns up another indicator: a $108 payment for trinkets with the
House of Representatives insignia to hand out to hosts on his trips
abroad to check out famine-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, reinforces his image as a
penny-pincher in his disbursement records. Among the recent
listings: five Pilot pens for $5.10 and an imitation leather desk
pad for $7.99. Doggett last year spent only 86.5 percent of his
allowance, according to a study by the National Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   _ With one of the fastest-growing districts in the country, Rep.
Mark Foley, R-Fla., has three offices back home and one of the
biggest House allowances, just under $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Every second year he uses part of his taxpayer funds to help
host a ``fly-in'' of Florida community leaders, which last year
cost his office $1,408 for a meal for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of expenditure that raises questions, Ruskin
said last week. ``Why is the member spending money on meals for
constituents?'' he asked. ``That's not an appropriate use of
taxpayer funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials say they are not concerned. ``If you
aren't spending anything you shouldn't, you shouldn't worry,'' said
Walker.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My husband and I both work from home. He's a telecommunications
marketing consultant. I'm a professional writer and speaker. Our
workplace is our home and our home is our workplace. On that simple
fact hangs the fate of our marriage.
</P>
<P>
   I came to this realization one lunchtime as my husband, Kalle,
and I circled each other in the kitchen. I coldly made my tuna
salad, sat down and ate it. He looked puzzled as he grabbed a hunk
of cheese and slunk back to his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nerve!'' I said to myself. ``What right does he have to
expect me to make lunch for him just because we're both at home?
After all, I'm working, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months earlier, each of us had bailed out of the corporate
world. Kalle, an executive at Northern Telecom, and I, an executive
at AT&AMP;T Wireless, formed our own consulting firm, Informed
Decisions International. Soon after, I noticed that during our
workday, whenever I went to the kitchen, my husband responded to
the sound of the refrigerator door the way a cat responds to that
of a can opener.
</P>
<P>
   The fateful afternoon of the tuna-cheese face-off, sitting at
the kitchen table, I felt guilty and confused about my anger. We
both love to cook, but before we left the corporate world, I had
insisted on making most meals. Now, however, during my working
hours, I wanted none of it. My husband was confused.
</P>
<P>
   What was happening with us is not unusual. The Small Business
Administration estimates that 800,000 businesses are jointly owned
by a man and woman, a total growing by about 5 percent a year. And
a major worry for small-business people, right up there with cash
flow, is ``driving my spouse crazy,'' according to Working Solo, a
marketing firm based in New Paltz, N.Y. That fear is especially
common among work-at-home couples, whether or not they have joined
in a single enterprise. It's not just Kalle and me.
</P>
<P>
   My training is in organizational psychology. I am supposed to
help people at work, not make them crazy. So I set out to distill
some lessons from the experience of working at home with my
husband. This is what I found:
</P>
<P>
   What works at home doesn't work at work, even when work and home
are one.
</P>
<P>
   Because we work in the same space, a space that also happens to
be our home, all of our marital presumptions are now in the
workplace and all of our workplace presumptions are now in the
home.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how I used to dress for work. My presumption: ``Hey,
it's my office and I'll dress like I want to.''
</P>
<P>
   But I am not alone in my office-home. As Kathy Marshack, author
of ``Entrepreneurial Couples'' (Davies-Black Publishing, 1998)
suggests, when you sit across from your partner at a home business
meeting in your jammies, the wrong presumptions may be made.
Because I am at the age _ 54 _ when I am embroiled with my husband,
who is 52, in thermostat wars, I used to appear at our meetings in
a lot less than jammies. I quickly discovered that this distracted
him from serious consideration of my business opinions. Now I cover
up.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider dishes in the sink. That had been a no-no. We used
to live in Manhattan, where dirty dishes were an invitation to turn
the apartment into a roach motel. When we started working at home _
part of the year in Palm Beach, Fla., and part in Woodstock, N.Y. _
we presumed that the rule still applied. After some stressful
lapses, we now know it's better to have dirty plates in the sink
than late proposals in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   However long you've been married, be ready to meet another side
of your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't known how Kalle did business because, well, I had never
done business with him. And, of course, I had no idea he didn't do
business the same way I did.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to office equipment, for example, I am a
technological troglodyte. Burned by the chaos that followed
so-called upgrades in the corporate world, I am a very late
adopter. Kalle, however, is a technology whiz, buying and
installing all the latest and greatest equipment. So when the new
telephones arrived for our home office, I thought a spaceship had
landed on my desk. After a few days of my mumbling about baffling
gadgets, and his grumbling about dinosaurs, we talked. We realized
that our business and our marriage benefited from Kalle's expertise
and my caution.
</P>
<P>
   Now we buy only equipment that I can understand or that he has
time to explain.
</P>
<P>
   How your parents worked is still at work.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Kalle and I got different messages about work. He
was raised in a Finnish-Brazilian family of reserved diplomats and
educators, I in an African-American family of a scrappy real estate
man and his wife. In Kalle's home, work was done ``out there,'' by
grown-ups. In mine, work was done ``right here'' by all: Mom wrote
rent receipts, and I stamped envelopes.
</P>
<P>
   So my husband and I are both entrepreneurs, but with a
difference. My fears of technology aside, I am what psychologists
call an all-'rounder: adaptive and ready to do whatever needs to be
done. Kalle is an organizer: rational, administrative, ready to
find the right person to do what needs to be done. When our company
started, I was shocked that Kalle wanted to hire someone to design
the logo; he was horrified that I wanted us to whip up something on
the computer. Talking it out helped us get to the cause of the
brouhaha: the messages we got in childhood about hiring people. We
agreed that, with all our computer equipment, we could design the
logo ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Talking things out. That's been the key to success for our
marriage and our company. Not able to finish my tuna salad, I went
to Kalle's office, apologized and asked him to help me figure out
what to do about lunches. Now we do what all those folks in the big
companies do: We order in.

WEB LANGUAGE CAN SPELL TROUBLE IN HTML 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: When I send e-mail to someone on America Online, they tell me
they get strange markings and the sentences are broken up. ``BSP''
is at the end of each sentence. Question: Do I have to do something
different when sending e-mail to someone on AOL? I use Netscape
Communicator as my browser and e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   A: Newer e-mail programs such as Netscape Messenger _ the e-mail
module that comes with Communicator _ and Outlook Express from
Microsoft all have the ability to compose and send e-mail in HTML,
or Hypertext Markup Language. That's the language that Web pages
are written in. So, when you send an e-mail using that feature, you
are essentially sending a Web page to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a problem here. Many other e-mail programs can't see
HTML pages. That includes the one used by America Online and its 17
million subscribers, as well as the freeware version of Qualcomm's
Eudora, which is generally considered to be the most popular e-mail
program used on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that these programs end up showing their
recipients lots of control codes that may get in the way of what
you are trying to say. Generally, if you don't know whether or not
someone can see an HTML-based piece of e-mail, send the message in
text-only format.
</P>
<P>
   To change to text-only in Communicator 4 and later, go to Edit,
then Preferences, then Mail &AMP; Newsgroups, then Formatting. Click
the box that lets you use the plain text editor, then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   In Outlook Express 4 and 5, click on Tools, Options, Send. Click
the Plain Text option.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial version of Eudora, Eudora Pro, handles this
beautifully. You can have Eudora ask you each time whether you want
to send plain or, as this software terms it, ``styled'' text. To
enable this feature in Eudora Pro 4 or later, go to Tools, Options,
then Styled Text. Make sure the Ask Me Each Time box is checked.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Each time I compose a letter in Microsoft Publisher, I give
it a name. When I press my print key I get a box that indicates
that my printer name is ``MS Publisher Color Printer.'' If I do not
change this to the name of my real printer _ Canon BJC-250 _ I get
a box called ``Print to File'' with a file name of .prn. How can I
get my current printer to automatically be listed in the name
section instead of ``MS Publisher Color Printer''?
</P>
<P>
   A: Open My Computer, then the Printers folder. Find your Canon
printer, right-click on it and choose Set As Default.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Re: the Help Line ``turning off the modem sound'' on May 28.
Instead of turning the volume down, you can turn it off. Navigate
to: Control Panel, then Modems, Properties, Connection, Advanced
and add ATM0 to the ``Extra Settings.'' Most modems support the AT
commands.
</P>
<P>
   A: Thanks for the tip. Several readers reported that with the
steps printed in that Help Line, they still couldn't turn the modem
sound off. This should help most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My modem was working fine. I decided to upgrade to Windows 98
from Windows 95, and now it will not work. I've tried everything I
know. Is it possible that it will never work again with 98?
</P>
<P>
   A: Quite a few modems ``broke'' when Windows 98 was introduced,
but it was simply a matter of acquiring new drivers for them. By
now, most manufacturers have updated their drivers, so check at the
Web site of your device's manufacturer. Download the drivers and
install them. That should fix your problem.
</P>
<P>
   You can find out who made your modem by looking in the Windows
Device Manager. Right-click on My Computer, then Properties, then
Device Manager. Double-click on the Modems item to see what kind it
is.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, June 11 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would
limit class action suits based on the Year 2000 computer problem.
Voting 57-41, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the proposal.
Supporters said the bill would limit the number of claims that can
be made against companies that warn their consumers in advance of
potential problems. Opponents said that the bill had too many
loopholes and preferred an alternative measure also being
considered by the Senate. A ``yes'' vote supported tabling the
bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PILL
</P>
<P>
   The House passed an amendment Tuesday, 217-214, on the
Agriculture Appropriations bill that prohibits testing
mifepristone, otherwise known as the abortion pill. Supporters said
is was unconstitutional to have taxpayer dollars go for research
that would terminate a fetus' development. Opponents said the
amendment ignores science and puts women's health in jeopardy. A
``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HAITI
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 227-198, a resolution to order
the remaining U.S. forces out of Haiti. Supporters said there is no
longer a need for the U.S troop presence in Haiti. Opponents said
that removing the troops was wrong because the U.S. had a moral
responsibility to stay and ensure that the upcoming elections are
peaceful. By taking away the troops, critics said, Haiti would be
left without any form of defense. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 225-203, a measure that would
allow women to obtain abortions at military hospitals overseas if
paid for with their own money. Supporters said women serving in the
military should not have to give up a constitutional right.
Opponents said current law, which allows women seeking abortions
because of rape, incest or life-threatening circumstances to get
them at military hospitals, is sufficient, and that military
hospitals should not have to perform abortions procedures. A
``yes'' vote favors the measure.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When the Fort Worth cattle herd leaves
downtown for its ceremonial trek to the Stockyards on Saturday,
Cathy Cannon will be alongside the longhorns _ every nervous step
of the way. She changed careers to be part of this cattle drive.
She took a salary cut to work the steers daily, and now she labors
nights and weekends to supplement her income and recover her
losses. Cannon is one of six full-time drovers who will push the
newly formed Fort Worth Herd down North Main Street toward Exchange

 By JANINE di GIOVANNI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    At 5 a.m. I am roused from a deep sleep by the hollow thud of a
bomb, about a quarter mile away. The birds are stirring, but it's
quiet in the rest of the camp _ a forward base of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, just a short hike from the border.
 &HT;    A missile shot, I tell myself, and slip back to sleep for a
couple of hours. By 9 a.m., however, a Serbian artillery and air
assault will begin in earnest, and at least four soldiers, possibly
as many as 16, will die.
 &HT;    ``Why are you here?'' I ask a 23-year-old architect, a Kosovar
who had been living in Switzerland.
 &HT;    It is a few minutes before 9 a.m. He is a medic in the camp
hospital _ once the stable of a small farm. He doesn't answer at
first. He is watching a beautiful female soldier, 17-year-old
Jacky, who saunters by carrying a Kalashnikov and wearing a
miniature leather Koran on a string around her neck. Her friend, a
19-year-old female soldier, is never seen without her Walkman,
usually playing British hip-hop.
 &HT;    ``Why am I here?'' the medic repeats idly, breaking off a piece
of bread. ``Because my country is important to me. I believe in
what I am doing. I believe in the U.C.K.''
 &HT;    U.C.K., ``Ushtria Clirimtare e Kosoves,'' is the Albanian name
of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The KLA was routed by the Serbs from
much of Kosovo _ along with hundreds of thousands of
ethnic-Albanian Kosovars _ but then began to prosper under the
protective shield of NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
 &HT;    Its ranks swelled from a few hundred just a year ago to as many
as 17,000 last month. However they are characterized _ freedom
fighters, terrorists, thugs, toy soldiers _ the rebel partisans are
players, and will remain so well into any peace.
 &HT;    Says Richard Haass, a former Bush administration official who is
now the director of foreign-policy studies at the Brookings
Institution: ``It's critical we get the KLA on board. It would be a
nightmare to have a NATO peacekeeping force that had to spend most
of its time fighting the KLA.''
 &HT;    I spent three weeks among them. The problem for the
underequipped, factionalized and disorganized KLA was how to
harness their enthusiasm and whip a throng of waiters, bartenders
and busboys into fighting units capable of facing down the armor,
artillery and professionalism of the Yugoslav Army. In a remarkably
short time, they became something approaching an army themselves.
 &HT;    On a May morning, we are eating stale bread and listening to the
BBC World Service, a story about the Serbs pulling some troops out
of Kosovo, when a bomb explodes 1,000 feet away.
 &HT;    We dive under a wooden picnic table, joining a tangle of bodies,
soldiers quicker off the mark than we were. A commander screams at
us to take cover in a ditch. I follow two soldiers scrambling up a
hill that suddenly seems impossibly steep. More bombs follow as we
run.
 &HT;    I wipe a soldier's mangled leg, plainly visible through his
tattered trousers. He is about 18. In shock, he keeps offering me
cigarettes from his package of L&AMP;Ms, repeatedly taking them out of
his camouflage jacket, which is also torn up. When I rub his head
to comfort him, it is burning hot. The young medic from Switzerland
curses and rips the wrapping off a bandage. Someone offers a bottle
of mercurochrome.
 &HT;    ``Be prepared for anything,'' shouts a commander, who appears
halfway through the ordeal to distribute helmets to those, like me,
who lack them. ``Be prepared for everything.''
 &HT;    Around me are soldiers of all kinds: some veterans of the
Yugoslav National Army, others who had fought in Bosnia, Croatia,
Morocco and the Persian Gulf war. Then there are the young ones,
the raw recruits who signed up in Vancouver, New York, London or
Geneva with no clear idea where they were going. No one admits to
fear, but you can see it in their faces and in their eyes.
 &HT;    ``Turn your watch back 400 years before coming to Albania,'' a
friend of mine, an experienced aid worker, told me before I
arrived.
 &HT;    She is a veteran of missions in Bosnia, Serbia, Rwanda and
Zaire. She does not exaggerate. The Albanian port of Durres, an
hour's drive from Tirana, is where it starts for most of the KLA
volunteers. Like most things Albanian, Durres is dusty, grimy,
cheap and dirty. White prefabricated houses dot the shoreline
overlooking the polluted Adriatic Sea, where wealthy Kosovars once
spent their summers.
 &HT;    For the past two months, Durres has been invaded by young
volunteers who want to fight for the KLA. Fresh-faced, they are
usually under 35 and have paid their own way.
 &HT;    They have bought their own equipment _ army fatigues,
olive-green T-shirts, guns that are routinely confiscated by
Italian police. Some of them hook up with groups like the Atlantic
Brigade, composed of Kosovar emigres from America and Canada.
Others simply arrive at the port and look for the bus station.
There, several minibuses a day will take them north to a KLA base
in the vicinity of Kukes, the refugee camp, for their first round
of training.
 &HT;    You can spot them a mile away, with their freshly shorn hair and
their earnest expressions. Nearly all the young recruits I meet had
been working in ``the restaurant business'' _ as waiters.
 &HT;    At the Cafe Drenica, a two-story white building overlooking a
stretch of shore where teen-agers play soccer, the KLA has opened
up a recruitment center. The place is decorated with posters of
Adem Jashari, the rebel fighter now elevated to the status of
national hero since he was brutally murdered along with most of his
family at Prekaz in March 1998 by the Serbs. Jashari is holding a
Kalashnikov and sporting an ammunition belt and a lot of facial
hair. Underneath his picture, touched up by soft-focus painting, is
the inscription: Homeland is calling.
 &HT;    Taf Tafa (``Tough Tougher'' in Albanian, but this is his real
name _ he produces a German driver's license to prove the point) is
one of the commanders at the Cafe Drenica.
 &HT;    Uniforms are piled in the corner, along with a rifle and a stack
of helmets. He reaches down, opens a drawer and produces a sack of
passports from recruits who registered there before being moved
north: Swiss, German, Swedish, Norwegian, American and British
passports, all in a jumble. ``It's like the European Union,'' he
says sardonically. ``It's a real international army.''
 &HT;    ``The KLA is a collection of various groups of Albanian
patriots,'' Billal Sherifi, the KLA political representative, tells
me later at the KLA's Tirana office, a crowded flat in an
all-concrete building that is difficult to find. Sherifi represents
one side of the KLA: the intellectuals who are ``outside'' Kosovo,
presenting a kinder, gentler face to the world.
 &HT;    At this point, I am not yet aware of the many factions within
the movement. I am simply trying to gain information. Later, I will
find out that one faction, still headed by Ibrahim Rugova, the
former political leader of the Kosovar Albanians, and his ally, a
German-based physician named Bujar Bukoshi, is locked in a power
struggle with a group led by Hashim Thaci, the Kosovar
representative to the ill-fated Rambouillet negotiations, the
failure of which precipitated the war. Many feel Thaci is the major
force in the KLA _ for now, at least.
 &HT;    When I meet the KLA contacts, it is in secrecy _ understandably,
as the Serbian paramilitaries have singled out intellectuals and
political leaders for execution. Our conversations take place in a
linguistic melange of French, Italian, English and Albanian.
 &HT;    Most KLA commanders appear to be bi- or trilingual, typically
having German, French or Italian as a third language along with
English, and are usually highly educated. (Most also speak
Serbo-Croatian, but they don't like to admit it.) The men I meet,
who will eventually arrange my passage to the front lines, usually
have noms de guerre and, sometimes, beefy bodyguards.
 &HT;    One of these is Visar Reka, a former filmmaker who learned
English so he could study the work of Martin Scorsese and Robert
Altman. (``Nashville'' is his favorite.) Now a KLA spokesman, he
sits with me in a backstreet cafe in Tirana, where we are served
lukewarm cappuccino while he chain-smokes.
 &HT;    The KLA's claim of 8,000 recruits in its training camps is
impossible to verify, but my own informal survey of the volunteer
pipeline from Durres to the Kosovo border lends it some credence.
Albania is crawling with volunteers. ``We have many more than we
have the capacity to train,'' Reka says. ``We don't have enough
uniforms. We are scavenging for guns.''
 &HT;    And a throng of raw, poorly armed recruits led by a few
experienced commanders was never going to be a match for Serbian
armor, artillery and air power. They wanted American tanks to go
with the air power.
 &HT;    ``We need help,'' one commander admitted a little woefully.
``We're not ashamed to admit it.'' Another young soldier put it
simply: ``When are those damned Apaches going to get off the
ground?''
 &HT;    On the 11th of May, I reach the border camp 15 miles up the
road. Living among the soldiers is like living in another world.
They sing, they eat, they wash with stream water from a rusty pipe.
But once again, there is the pervasive sense of fear and waiting,
punctuated by the sight of bodies brought on stretchers from the
front. The hospital is full of wounded and bloody soldiers. Bombs
fall sporadically. It isn't just that the camp is dangerous; some
days, it feels like the end of the earth.
 &HT;    The next morning, the Serbian bombardment starts, and I'm forced
to lie in that squalid trench for four or five hours. At
midafternoon, after the bombing and shelling has stopped, we hike
into the hills and find the wing and tail lights of a Serbian
plane. We cross a stream, trudge over some hills and scamper across
a field, running to avoid snipers.
 &HT;    Finally, the commander says: ``OK, stop. Lie here.'' We stop,
panting, in a heavily wooded area. When I turn, I see soldiers
everywhere: young guys dug in, sitting with Kalashnikovs, machine
guns and khaki uniforms. They lie back in their positions, smoking
cigarettes and looking at us in amazement.
 &HT;    Suddenly, I see my interpreter from Pristina, staring at
someone. Her face drops. Her mouth opens. She is staring at a
handsome young soldier who is crouching in a foxhole. He calls her
name. As if in a dream, she walks over and looks down. Her
expression softens, and they speak quietly in Albanian for a bit,
and then we are called away.
 &HT;    Within five minutes, we are in the midst of a firefight and we
lie on our stomachs underneath a bush until it is safe to run to an
abandoned stone house filled with soldiers.
 &HT;    ``That was my first boyfriend in Pristina,'' my interpreter
says, still stunned. ``I haven't seen him in three years.'' She
pauses. ``I wanted to give him a hug. He was waiting for me to give
him a hug. But I couldn't do it. There were too many other soldiers
around and there was no one to hug them. It wouldn't have been
fair, would it?''
 &HT;    This is what has happened to her since she fell in love with the
young fighter a million years ago in Pristina: Her best friend, the
most beautiful girl in the city, died in her arms in a Pristina
cafe; she herself was shot in the neck and the arms; in Albania, a
month later, she was raped by local men who told her they were
policemen.
 &HT;    Once, she confided, she dreamed of falling in love with someone
and becoming a famous actress. Now she says things to me like, ``I
don't want anyone to touch me.'' Or, ``Do you think I will go
mad?''
 &HT;    At 3 a.m. the following morning, we are awakened by a heavy
thud; more bombs. After our experience the day before, we are
prepared, sleeping in clothes and boots, ready to run for cover
outside our tents. The Serbs, the soldiers believe, can detect body
heat in the tents. So we move quickly in the dark, to the cover of
a trench.
 &HT;    For hours, we lie there, on a steep, muddy slope. The Bosnian
commander, with his handsome, craggy face, stands next to me
smoking cigarette after cigarette. He tells my interpreter that he
lost his entire family in the war. Later he goes into a tent and
brings us back a blanket to cover us. ``I am used to the cold,'' he
says.
 &HT;    We leave the camp in the afternoon, hitching a ride on a
military van. Twelve hours later, I am sleeping in a real bed in
Kukes, which doesn't seem quite so grimy and godforsaken as it did
just three days before.
 &HT;    What will become of this army? By the first days of June, the
young fighters already seem distant. They got the world's
attention, but that attention is now shifting to reconstruction and
resettlement. So far, KLA leaders have expressed a willingness to
accept the peace plan, though they remain deeply skeptical of
Milosevic's true intentions and strongly committed to achieving
their goal of independence; autonomy within Yugoslavia, as called
for in the peace settlement, is not in their plans.
 &HT;    The rebels are supposed to lay down their arms, and they
probably will _ but will they abandon their cause? I doubt it. They
have tasted power. They have watched their friends die in their
arms _ but for what? They have been clear from the start that they
want to escape Serbian repression. And they are the Kosovo
Liberation Army, not the Kosovo Autonomy Army. But now the world is
impatient; the world wants to move on.

representative to the ill-fated Rambouillet negotiations, the
failure of which precipitated the war. Many feel Thaci is the major
force in the KLA _ for now, at least.
 &HT;    When I meet the KLA contacts, it is in secrecy _ understandably,
as the Serbian paramilitaries have singled out intellectuals and
political leaders for execution. Our conversations take place in a
linguistic melange of French, Italian, English and Albanian.
 &HT;    Most KLA commanders appear to be bi- or trilingual, typically
having German, French or Italian as a third language along with
English, and are usually highly educated. (Most also speak
Serbo-Croatian, but they don't like to admit it.) The men I meet,
who will eventually arrange my passage to the front lines, usually
have noms de guerre and, sometimes, beefy bodyguards.
 &HT;    One of these is Visar Reka, a former filmmaker who learned
English so he could study the work of Martin Scorsese and Robert
Altman. (``Nashville'' is his favorite.) Now a KLA spokesman, he
sits with me in a backstreet cafe in Tirana, where we are served
lukewarm cappuccino while he chain-smokes.
 &HT;    The KLA's claim of 8,000 recruits in its training camps is
impossible to verify, but my own informal survey of the volunteer
pipeline from Durres to the Kosovo border lends it some credence.
Albania is crawling with volunteers. ``We have many more than we
have the capacity to train,'' Reka says. ``We don't have enough
uniforms. We are scavenging for guns.''
 &HT;    And a throng of raw, poorly armed recruits led by a few
experienced commanders was never going to be a match for Serbian
armor, artillery and air power. They wanted American tanks to go
with the air power.
 &HT;    ``We need help,'' one commander admitted a little woefully.
``We're not ashamed to admit it.'' Another young soldier put it
simply: ``When are those damned Apaches going to get off the
ground?''
 &HT;    On the 11th of May, I reach the border camp 15 miles up the
road. Living among the soldiers is like living in another world.
They sing, they eat, they wash with stream water from a rusty pipe.
But once again, there is the pervasive sense of fear and waiting,
punctuated by the sight of bodies brought on stretchers from the
front. The hospital is full of wounded and bloody soldiers. Bombs
fall sporadically. It isn't just that the camp is dangerous; some
days, it feels like the end of the earth.
 &HT;    The next morning, the Serbian bombardment starts, and I'm forced
to lie in that squalid trench for four or five hours. At
midafternoon, after the bombing and shelling has stopped, we hike
into the hills and find the wing and tail lights of a Serbian
plane. We cross a stream, trudge over some hills and scamper across
a field, running to avoid snipers.
 &HT;    Finally, the commander says: ``OK, stop. Lie here.'' We stop,
panting, in a heavily wooded area. When I turn, I see soldiers
everywhere: young guys dug in, sitting with Kalashnikovs, machine
guns and khaki uniforms. They lie back in their positions, smoking
cigarettes and looking at us in amazement.
 &HT;    Suddenly, I see my interpreter from Pristina, staring at
someone. Her face drops. Her mouth opens. She is staring at a
handsome young soldier who is crouching in a foxhole. He calls her
name. As if in a dream, she walks over and looks down. Her
expression softens, and they speak quietly in Albanian for a bit,
and then we are called away.
 &HT;    Within five minutes, we are in the midst of a firefight and we
lie on our stomachs underneath a bush until it is safe to run to an
abandoned stone house filled with soldiers.
 &HT;    ``That was my first boyfriend in Pristina,'' my interpreter
says, still stunned. ``I haven't seen him in three years.'' She
pauses. ``I wanted to give him a hug. He was waiting for me to give
him a hug. But I couldn't do it. There were too many other soldiers
around and there was no one to hug them. It wouldn't have been
fair, would it?''
 &HT;    This is what has happened to her since she fell in love with the
young fighter a million years ago in Pristina: Her best friend, the
most beautiful girl in the city, died in her arms in a Pristina
cafe; she herself was shot in the neck and the arms; in Albania, a
month later, she was raped by local men who told her they were
policemen.
 &HT;    Once, she confided, she dreamed of falling in love with someone
and becoming a famous actress. Now she says things to me like, ``I
don't want anyone to touch me.'' Or, ``Do you think I will go
mad?''
 &HT;    At 3 a.m. the following morning, we are awakened by a heavy
thud; more bombs. After our experience the day before, we are
prepared, sleeping in clothes and boots, ready to run for cover
outside our tents. The Serbs, the soldiers believe, can detect body
heat in the tents. So we move quickly in the dark, to the cover of
a trench.
 &HT;    For hours, we lie there, on a steep, muddy slope. The Bosnian
commander, with his handsome, craggy face, stands next to me
smoking cigarette after cigarette. He tells my interpreter that he
lost his entire family in the war. Later he goes into a tent and
brings us back a blanket to cover us. ``I am used to the cold,'' he
says.
 &HT;    We leave the camp in the afternoon, hitching a ride on a
military van. Twelve hours later, I am sleeping in a real bed in
Kukes, which doesn't seem quite so grimy and godforsaken as it did
just three days before.
 &HT;    What will become of this army? By the first days of June, the
young fighters already seem distant. They got the world's
attention, but that attention is now shifting to reconstruction and
resettlement. So far, KLA leaders have expressed a willingness to
accept the peace plan, though they remain deeply skeptical of
Milosevic's true intentions and strongly committed to achieving
their goal of independence; autonomy within Yugoslavia, as called
for in the peace settlement, is not in their plans.
 &HT;    The rebels are supposed to lay down their arms, and they
probably will _ but will they abandon their cause? I doubt it. They
have tasted power. They have watched their friends die in their
arms _ but for what? They have been clear from the start that they
want to escape Serbian repression. And they are the Kosovo
Liberation Army, not the Kosovo Autonomy Army. But now the world is
impatient; the world wants to move on.

A SCIENCE CAREER, PIANO TALENT AND REEL GENIUS, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Among its 92 competitors, the International
Piano Competition for Outstanding Amateurs has several geniuses _
including Michael Hawley, professor of media technology at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   And, though he's not a professional musician, he says that
playing the piano has been an important part of his development in
other fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most productive and creative times in my life have been
when I've been practicing the piano,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hawley, 37, has applied his genius in both popular and esoteric
areas: He may well be the only contestant who has worked for both
George Lucas (you know, the guy who came up with those ``Star
Wars'' movies) and composer Pierre Boulez. The latter occurred at
the Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/Musique
(IRCAM), a center for development of electronic music in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Genius hasn't stifled Hawley's whimsical nature, however;
there's a stack of yo-yos on his desk, and he's apt to practice his
competition repertoire on the hotel-bar piano when he travels to
lecture. We caught him by phone in Fort Lauderdale last week, where
he was scheduled to present a lecture for IBM. He's been so busy,
he said, that he started practicing seriously for the competition
only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Born in California and reared in New Jersey, Hawley played by
ear as a youngster and got serious about piano in high school _
serious enough to apply to the renowned Curtis Institute of Music
in Philadelphia, but not serious enough to be accepted there.
Instead, he entered Yale, where he simultaneously earned bachelor's
degrees in music and science _ while financing his education by
working at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, a 2 1/2-hour commute
from Yale.
</P>
<P>
   The double major served him well when he went to work for
Lucasfilm, where from 1984 to 1986, he helped invent technology for
the burgeoning digital film industry.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued his devotion to the piano, too. While working
on his doctorate at MIT from 1986 to '93, he continued to study
piano. He played concerts and chamber music performances regularly
_ and worked up tricks like programing a pair of Bosendorfer pianos
to play Liszt's Totentanz, hooking up a computer interface to the
player-piano mechanism that had previously been attached to the
acoustic pianos.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn Foundation executive director Richard Rodzinski met
Hawley at the Jack Kilby Awards in Dallas in 1987, when Hawley was
being honored for innovation in science and music; Rodzinski
encouraged Hawley to enter the amateur competition, which is
sponsored by the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had fallen out of practice,'' Hawley says. ``Richard gave me
the kick in the pants. And I've had a marvelous time getting
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawley made his first bid for advancement yesterday with Liszt's
transcription of J.S. Bach's Fantasy and Fugue in G minor, hoping
to move to today's second round with a pair of ragtime pieces by
William Bolcom and Liszt's ``Mephisto Waltz No. 1.'' If he makes
the finals tomorrow, he'll perform Faure's Nocturne No. 13 in B
minor and Chopin's Sonata in B minor _ proving that, even though
he's a high-tech genius, he's a romantic at heart.

CLINTON-YELTSIN SUMMIT DESIGNED TO COOL ANTI-WEST BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, departing Tuesday for
consultations in Europe on post-war Kosovo, may need to cash in on
his chummy ``Bill and Boris'' partnership with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to ease strains stemming from NATO'S victorious
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin plan a separate summit in Cologne, Germany,
next Saturday during the annual gathering of leaders from the Group
of Eight nations that brings together officials from the United
States, Russia, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will consult with French President Jacques Chirac
in Paris, address the International Labor Organization in Geneva,
meet with leaders of the 15-nation European Union and visit
Slovenia, a former republic of Yugoslavia, during a seven-day trip
to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president also may visit a refugee
camp in the Balkans before returning to the United States on June
22.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said allied leaders are planning to salute
Yeltsin at the Cologne summit for helping the western alliance
persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw Yugoslav
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin repeatedly dispatched former Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin to Belgrade during the allied air offensive to
seek an agreement with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting comes amid a deepening anti-western backlash
across Russia. Opinion polls show ordinary Russians regard the
U.S.-led air campaign against Yugoslavia as the latest in a string
of humiliations inflicted upon Russia by an encroaching western
alliance bent on exploiting the weakness of the former Cold War-era
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   James M. Goldgeier, former director of Russian affairs at the
National Security Council earlier in the Clinton presidency, says
Clinton must allay Russian concerns during his summit with Yeltsin
or face the risk that Russians will turn to nationalistic,
anti-western candidates in next year's Russian presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is likely to insist on a wider Russian role in Kosovo,
guaranteed Yugoslav sovereignty over Kosovo and suspension of
western efforts to encourage the ouster of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, whose Slavic homeland enjoys long-standing ties with
Yugoslavia, is expected to challenge NATO plans to cede virtual
independence to the predominantly ethnic Albanian Muslim province
of Kosovo in order to persuade the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army to surrender weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues between the United States and Russia include
differences over future allied intervention in humanitarian crises,
repayment of Soviet-era debt and the Kremlin's preference for the
Group of Eight nations to deal with future European security
disputes rather than the 19-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. Russia is a member of the G-8 but not of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The sensitivity of the U.S.-Russian relationship in Kosovo was
underscored late last week when the Kremlin surprised senior U.S.
officials by moving a convoy of Russian troops from Bosnia across
Serbia and toward Kosovo before military command-and-control
arrangements had been worked out with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The southbound column of more than 50 Russian armored vehicles
and trucks flying Russian flags prompted Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to order Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott to return to Moscow immediately to negotiate arrangements
for up to 10,000 Russian troops to join the international
peacekeeping force moving into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insist that the 50,000-strong peacekeeping force,
commanded in the field by a Briton, be under the direct command of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has rejected having Russian troops serve under NATO
command. But U.S. officials are hopeful that Russia will agree to
have Russian troops serve under a Russian commander based at NATO
headquarters in Belgium _ an arrangement used for Russian troops
serving in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton and Yeltsin work out differences and cooperate
as they have on other issues in the past, Yeltsin's successor is
likely to win next year's Russian presidential election on promises
to ``rebuild military strength (and) to play the nuclear hand a
little more riskily,'' Goldgeier said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution and a former National Security Council
official in the Bush administration, says Yeltsin may press Clinton
for additional international financial assistance to reward Kremlin
cooperation in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin seeks immediate payment of $4.5 billion in promised
assistance from the International Monetary Fund even though he has
not been able to win approval of IMF-sought legislation by the
Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could well be a growing gap between Russian expectations
and western preparedness to act,'' Haass said. ``The Russians feel
now that they're owed something.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin also must ``begin to try to bridge some of
the differences on humanitarian intervention which is a fundamental
disagreement between the United States and Russia,'' Haass said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia opposes international intervention in sovereign nations,
even in the face of humanitarian crises, in part because the
Kremlin fears European intervention in many of the nasty ethnic
disputes that smoulder in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is banking once again on payoffs from a so-called
``Clinton-Yeltsin bargain'' that provides Russia a prominent role
at European summits in return for the Kremlin's cooperation on
issues of vital western interest, Goldgeier said.
</P>
<P>
   But these experts said there was little hope that Clinton could
parlay U.S.-Russia cooperation to end the war in Kosovo into fresh
energy to ratify a stalled seven-year-old nuclear weapons reduction
treaty or to win Russian compliance with U.S. demands for the
Kremlin to end nuclear technology cooperation with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   With a parliamentary election in Russia in December and
presidential elections looming next year in both the United States
and Russia, there is little prospect for ``any big cooperative
steps,'' Goldgeier said, adding: ``We're likely to see a holding
pattern until after both presidents are elected next year.''

<P>
   LONDON _ When it comes to sure bets, nothing seems quite as
predictable as the idea that, in Britain at least, people will go
to the pub and enjoy a tipple.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few weeks, Allied Domecq PLC, the staid
distiller and pub chain that so exemplifies that notion, has seen
some surprising events that should serve notice to investors that
little in the world of commerce is ever predictable. In short
order, Allied Domecq has received an investment from a famed
billionaire, shed its chain of pubs, announced the replacement of
its chief executive and become the subject of takeover rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The question for investors, naturally, is whether these
developments, and the accompanying rise in Allied's stock price,
make the company more or less attractive than it was.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of events began on May 18, when a British newspaper
reported that Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company controlled by
Warren E. Buffett, had taken a 2.2 percent stake in Allied.
Presumably, the purchase reflected Buffett's liking for name brands
like Coca-Cola and Gillette; Allied's spirits portfolio includes
barroom staples like Beefeater gin, Ballantine's and Canadian Club
whiskies, Sauza tequila and Kahlua liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, Allied struck a $3.8 billion deal to sell its more
than 3,500 pubs to Whitbread PLC, a brewing and leisure business.
Analysts noted that the deal leaves Allied free to concentrate on
spirits _ and that is where investors see money.
</P>
<P>
   Also on May 25, Allied announced that Tony Hales, its chief
executive the last eight years, would resign after the completion
of the deal to make way for the finance director, Phillip Bowman _
a move praised by investors. ``Bowman is a highly competent chief
executive and the appointment is good news,'' said Mark Puleikas, a
beverages analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   There remains, however, the issue of how much upside is left in
the stock, which have risen from a 1998 low of 451 pounds ($7.23)
in February to close at 6.005 pounds ($9.62) in London last week,
and how best to get it. (Allied's American depository receipts
closed at $9.625, with each ADR representing one ordinary share.)
</P>
<P>
   Some say that a deal _ either a merger, sale or acquisition _ is
necessary to bolster Allied's share price. Others think not.
</P>
<P>
   Puleikas, for example, rates Allied neutral at a pre-deal fair
value price of 5.50 pounds ($8.80). But, he added, ``the 5.50 pound
price is based on the presumption that nothing happens'' to change
Allied's status as a stand-alone company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are of the view that to move forward, Allied Domecq needs
to undertake the long-awaited spirits merger,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allied's divestitures inspired a crop of merger rumors,
all reflecting the belief that the company will have to merge to
fend off its rival Diageo PLC, which has twice the spirits volume
of Allied. Diageo, itself the product of a 1997 merger of Grand
Metropolitan and Guinness, owns popular brands like Johnnie Walker
whisky and Smirnoff vodka. British newspapers said Bacardi of
Bermuda, Brown-Forman of Louisville, Ky., and Pernod Ricard of
France were interested in a deal. Seagram of Montreal was also
mentioned as a possible suitor. Allied has denied the reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal with Whitbread seems to be selling a poor business to
keep a good business, and that good business has the potential to
do further deals,'' said a British money manager whose firm holds
Allied shares. Depending on the outcome of any such negotiations,
the manager said, Allied's price in a year could be between 50 and
100 pence higher.
</P>
<P>
   But others think Allied can reward shareholders handsomely
without putting itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Winston, a beverage analyst at HSBC Securities in
London, is impressed with the managers of Allied's European spirits
business, saying they have proved themselves to be adept marketers.
As the company stands now, Winston puts its fair value at 6.50
pounds a share ($10.42). But with the right managers chosen from
the ranks of its European business, he thinks the stock is worth 7
pounds ($11.23). And Robert G. Cumming, an analyst at Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, has a ``buy'' rating on the stock, with a
12-month target of 7 pounds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jennings, manager of the Oppenheimer Global Growth and
Income fund, has held Allied stock for more than three years. He
reckons that by shedding its pubs, the company has positioned
itself to advance. ``They can take that cash and either buy brands
or buy back stock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said Allied has underlying growth potential of about 10
percent. After spinning off the pubs, he said, ``it becomes one of
those little money machines as opposed to something that loses
everything it makes in the pubs.''

WASHINGTON, June 11 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would
limit class action suits based on the Year 2000 computer problem.
Voting 57-41, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the proposal.
Supporters said the bill would limit the number of claims that can
be made against companies that warn their consumers in advance of
potential problems. Opponents said that the bill had too many
loopholes and preferred an alternative measure also being
considered by the Senate. A ``yes'' vote supported tabling the
bill.

<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PILL
</P>
<P>
   The House passed an amendment Tuesday, 217-214, on the
Agriculture Appropriations bill that prohibits testing
mifepristone, otherwise known as the abortion pill. Supporters said
is was unconstitutional to have taxpayer dollars go for research
that would terminate a fetus' development. Opponents said the
amendment ignores science and puts women's health in jeopardy. A
``yes'' vote supports the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HAITI
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 227-198, a resolution to order
the remaining U.S. forces out of Haiti. Supporters said there is no
longer a need for the U.S troop presence in Haiti. Opponents said
that removing the troops was wrong because the U.S. had a moral
responsibility to stay and ensure that the upcoming elections are
peaceful. By taking away the troops, critics said, Haiti would be
left without any form of defense. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 225-203, a measure that would
allow women to obtain abortions at military hospitals overseas if
paid for with their own money. Supporters said women serving in the
military should not have to give up a constitutional right.
Opponents said current law, which allows women seeking abortions
because of rape, incest or life-threatening circumstances to get
them at military hospitals, is sufficient, and that military
hospitals should not have to perform abortions procedures. A
``yes'' vote favors the measure.

NATO HOPES TO AVOID `NIGHTMARE SCENARIO' WITH REFUGEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORINI, Albania _ A few eager refugees came back to the border
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No one tried to go home, and it was not hard to see why: bombs
are no longer falling, but smoke rose from two villages on the
Kosovo side. Photographers with long lenses said two corpses
floated on the far side of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Destruction aside, however, there was no sign of what aid
officials here have begun calling the ``nightmare scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the possibility that huge numbers of refugees pick up
and move back to Kosovo before NATO has made sure Serbian forces
are gone, villages are de-mined and houses are freed from booby
traps.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that refugees could return before power is restord
or there is enough food or water. Tractors putting along could clog
the main road, already rutted and barely passable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, aid officials say they are trying to head off what
could become the Kosovo refugee crisis in reverse, with the added
danger that the refugees would be resettling on a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic message is: If possible, don't go home on your
own,'' said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Kukes. ``But it's going to be
tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups say, for the moment, that they believe signs point
away from a mad rush to the border once NATO troops arrive Kosovo.
And while many refugees said several days ago they would return as
soon as they could, interviews Friday suggested more caution now
that going home has become more than a theory.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, for example, the first real sign of the NATO
force that will go into Kosovo was expected to arrive here: the
advance party for the 1,500 German troops that will enter from
Albania as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mines, you know, and it's dangerous,'' Jashar
Rrahmonaj, a 27-year-old farmer, said at the border, looking up to
the clouds of smoke above the Kosovar towns of Gorozhupe and Zhur.
``You can see them burning the villages up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rrahmonaj whizzed up in a white van with eight friends and
relatives to the border post, which only days ago rumbled with NATO
bombs and exploded mortars from fighting between Serbian forces and
the Kosovo Liberation Army. But they did not cross: They came to
get exit cards from Albanian customs officers, which many refugees
believe, mistakenly, will be required for their return.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the refugees' apparent hesitation to leave now, aid
officials say they are preparing for chaos. Radio messages and
posters are warning of the danger of mines, pleading with people to
wait until NATO has declared Kosovo safe.
</P>
<P>
   There are plans to distribute leaflets, conduct mine awareness
classes and work with women and youth groups to urge participation
in the ``ordered'' return _ which will probably not start for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program is preparing monthly rations to
distribute at the border, though that creates problems of its own:
The food package for one person _ 38 pounds of flour, rice, beans,
canned foods _ will be very hard to carry.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR has also begun testing a system for re-creating the
official identity of the Kosovar refugees _ most of them stripped
by the Serbs of passports, drivers licenses and other documents _
by issuing cards with the refugees' photos. The cards will be
required for receiving aid once they get home.
</P>
<P>
   But the process takes 20 minutes per family because the system
tries to get as much information as possible, including how much
schooling each refugee has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be labor-intensive,'' Colville said.
</P>
<P>
   In the event refugees flood back home, Colville said that there
is a backup plan to simply issue papers at the border naming the
head of household. Those papers would be traded in later for the
more permanent card.

IS THE CULTURE THE CAUSE OF ALL OF SOCIETY'S ILLS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a villain at large in the land. What led to the
horrendous behavior of the convicted policemen in the Abner Louima
torture case? What caused the killings of high school students in
Littleton, Colo.? Why did welfare often fail to change the
underclass into the working poor? Why has Microsoft been so
ruthless? And why do so many American students perform so poorly on
standardized tests?
</P>
<P>
   Culture.
</P>
<P>
   A culture of police conduct; a culture of racism; a culture of
violence; a culture of video games; a culture of poverty; a culture
of corporate aggression; a culture of permissiveness; a culture of
capitalism; a culture of multiculturalism.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the relatively new academic field of cultural
studies also treats culture as the villain: a con artist that must
be subverted, unmasked and contested.
</P>
<P>
   This roster might lead us to suspect that the word culture has
been denatured to the point of meaninglessness, but the reverse is
true. Apparently culture now provides the foundation of all
meanings. Culture has become the prime mover, the first cause. As
Adam Gopnik recently wrote in The New Yorker: ``Every age has a
term to explain things that resist explanation. The Elizabethans
had Fate; the Victorians had History; we have Culture.'' Culture
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Culture has been consolidating that power for decades. In 1952
two leading American anthropologists, Clyde Kluckhohn and Alfred
Kroeber, argued that culture is ``one of the key notions in
contemporary American thought.'' They compared it to the concepts
of gravity in physics and disease in medicine. But by treating it
as a part of American thought, they acknowledged something else:
culture, unlike gravity and disease, is itself a cultural creation.
It developed out of particular ways of thinking about the world.
And the more power culture accumulates, the more urgent it is to
understand just what it is, how it came to be and how it affects
the way we think.
</P>
<P>
   Some hints can be found in an elegant historical survey in the
opening chapters of a new book by anthropologist Adam Kuper:
``Culture: The Anthropologists' Account'' (Harvard). The modern
idea of culture, he suggests (drawing on the work of German
sociologist Norbert Elias), began as an 18th-century German
response to the French notion of civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization, the French asserted, was a progressive human
accomplishment, evolving over centuries. It was a supreme
achievement of Reason, culminating in the Enlightenment. But for
German intellectuals, civilization was a danger to Kultur. For
them, culture was everything civilization was not. It developed out
of spiritual values rather than reason; it was particular rather
than universal; it was reflective rather than progressive. Culture,
not civilization, was the touchstone of the Romantic
Counterenlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition between civilization and culture helped define
two centuries of French-German intellectual rivalry. It also
influenced the conflict between the 19th-century European left,
with its universalist vision of humanity guided by rational
scientific principles, and the European right, with its
particularist vision of a nation and its spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the celebration of cultural primacy is now associated
with the left in doctrines of multiculturalism, but the basic
tension between the universal and particular remains.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of culture did not develop only from opposition to a
universal human order. As anthropologists have suggested, culture
also arises out of a challenge to a binding natural order. Nature
might declare that humans are inherently acquisitive or polygamous
or rebellious; culture says it can shape human material as it
wishes. Nature is immutable; culture is constructed. Nature is the
domain of science; culture is the domain of art.
</P>
<P>
   These two declarations of independence, from Enlightenment
civilization and from nature, may have been crucial to forming the
dominant American idea of culture. Here culture becomes insistently
democratic. No culture can claim priority over any other because
there is no universal principle that might limit a culture's
authority, not even natural law. Thus culture becomes thoroughly
malleable, a free-floating set of beliefs, preferences, life
styles.
</P>
<P>
   The only catch is that because no other authority is recognized,
culture is given absolute authority over its adherents; it is
thought to mold their every act and thought.
</P>
<P>
   This is a strange situation. We know that culture has a
tremendous influence: it affects our tastes, manners, assumptions
and actions. But if we assert that culture is both absolute and
arbitrary, then culture becomes at once everything and nothing. To
a certain extent, this is the complaint of Frances Fukuyama in his
new book, ``The Great Disruption'' (Free Press). He is disturbed by
the ``problem of cultural relativism'' and its effects on social
life. He searches for a higher authority, arguing, unconvincingly,
I think, that human nature is in itself so powerful that culture
will eventually acknowledge its presence, accommodate its limits
and devise arrangements that might reconstitute what he sees as a
disrupted social order.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the modern idea of culture reigns both
powerless and supreme. Diverse and ancient ways of thinking about
human action _ notions of will, freedom, responsibility, virtue _
fade away, becoming mere flickers of cultural preference.
</P>
<P>
   And if something goes awry, culture is so arbitrary that it is
also thought to be easily altered.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers kill? Check ID at movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers smoke? Eliminate tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Cultures conflict? Teach tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural solutions are as simple as the cultural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the real villain is the culture of culture.

MY CANADIAN CONNECTION WITH `AUSTIN POWERS'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the credits for ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''
the sequel to the inspired 1997 spy spoof, Mike Myers mugs through
another elaborately choreographed dance number. The first time I
heard this swinging instrumental by the Quincy Jones Orchestra, I
could have sworn it was the theme music from ``Definition,'' a
Canadian game show from the 1970s, whose idea of a grand prize was
a Brother typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course! I figured Myers must have chosen it as an inside
joke. After all, he grew up in Toronto. So did I, and every time I
see a Myers movie or ``Saturday Night Live'' sketch, I get pangs of
proprietary recognition and envy. We're roughly the same age. We
both watched the same bad television shows, obsessed over hockey,
hung out at doughnut shops. The difference is, he has parlayed all
these cultural reference points into a career as an acclaimed funny
man and coiner of catch phrases. I'm reduced to interviewing him
and going to his movies.
</P>
<P>
   This is my pain.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Graham's big entrance in the new ``Powers'' is
accompanied by a Lenny Kravitz cover of ``American Woman,'' the
1970 anthem by Canada's own Guess Who. I used to worship the Guess
Who. Myers has Ms. Graham go-go dancing to them.
</P>
<P>
   It started with ``Wayne's World,'' the sketch about two
basement-bound teen-agers Myers and Dana Carvey originated on
``SNL'' and continued in two hit movies. These guys suit up for
street hockey in full padding and goalie masks, for a game played
with a tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
   I did that.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wayne and Garth, we'd have to yell ``Car!'' every few
minutes and drag the net onto the sidewalk. If you called another
kid on high sticking, he'd say, ``No way.'' To which you'd respond,
``Way!'' _ another Wayne-and-Garthism.
</P>
<P>
   They supposedly lived in the Chicago suburb of Aurora, Ill., but
I knew better. Myers grew up in ``Scar-beria,'' as the remote
Toronto suburb of Scarborough was known to those of us who lived
inside dynamic metro Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne's crazy ex-girlfriend gave him a gun rack. I know the
real-life ex-girlfriend who gave Myers a gun rack (it was a joke,
and she's not really crazy). Wayne and Garth went to a bar called
the Gasworks. A friend of mine bit chunks out of beer glasses at a
biker bar with the same name. I used to go to Tim Horton Donuts, a
chain serving the city's voracious doughnut needs. Myers
Americanized the name, replacing a retired Toronto Maple Leaf with
a Chicago Blackhawk, to come up with Stan Mikita Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Garth drives a Pacer. We had a Chevette.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just ``Wayne World.'' Dieter, the pretentious German
talk-show host Myers played on ``SNL,'' was based on a waiter he
knew at a restaurant on Queen Street, in the East Village of
Toronto. Hey, I knew pretentious waiters on Queen Street! Sure,
that's a bit of a reach. But what about the crazed kilted Scotsman
_ another of his favorite characters? He plays one in his 1993
romantic comedy, ``So I Married an Axe Murderer,'' and in the new
``Austin Powers'' (a grotesque villain named Fat Bastard). On
``SNL'' he did sketches set in a store called All Things Scottish,
based, I suspect, on a Toronto landmark called Richardson's Tartan
Shop, just up the street from the Gasworks. My grandmother was
Scottish.
</P>
<P>
   He also has an affection for all things Jewish (see his ``I'm
far-klemt'' Linda Richman routine), even though he's not. Same
here.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, once
wrote ``I am Rushdie'' in an article protesting the fatwa against
Salman Rushdie. To express my own brand of deep identification,
I've thought of getting a button made that says, ``I am Myers.''
</P>
<P>
   I've talked to him twice, for an article on funny Canadians and
at the time of the original ``Powers.'' At the risk of seeming
stalkerish, I brought up a couple of these connections. Over lunch
two years ago at the Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, I told him
I'd just met his brother Paul, who had done a funny song at the
wedding of a mutual friend in Toronto. Myers muttered something
like, ``Oh, great.'' It was as if I'd violated some rule by
bringing up a personal connection. He looked thrown off his script,
confused about how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   I've gotten this reaction before from movie stars. In the
theater of the celebrity interview, breaking the fourth wall is not
done. You could be telling the star that you both shared the same
birth mother, and he or she would stare blankly at you and keep
talking about how great it was shooting on location in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps me from getting weird or resentful about Myers' fame
and my comparative lack thereof is that I find almost everything he
does extremely funny. Maybe because we were weaned on the same
uniquely Canadian hybrid of British and American humor. In Rolling
Stone's June 10 cover story on Myers, he talks touchingly about his
late father, who used to wake little Mike up in the middle of the
night to watch Peter Sellers movies.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say Myers is the next Sellers. I merely look a
little like Sellers. Then again, my father never woke me up in the
middle of the night to watch ``The Pink Panther,'' although I do
remember lying in bed hearing my parents giggling at a similar
strain of silly British wit, ``Monty Python's Flying Circus.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more you know about people, the less you covet their
lives. Reading Chris Heath's excellent Rolling Stone profile, I
realized that whatever gave Myers his talent also made him _ how to
put this gently? _ unenviably odd. He spends much of his spare time
collecting and painting plastic army men. He hates to be touched.
His co-star, Ms. Graham, attested to their lack of off-screen
chemistry, calling him ``the least flirtatious person I ever met.''
</P>
<P>
   No way.
</P>
<P>
   Way.

AMONG ALBANIANS WHO STAYED IN KOSOVO, FEAR PERSISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia _ Up a pitted dirt road on the outskirts of
town, near a still-smoldering house and the sun-baked remains of
looted shops, two Albanian men, clearly frightened, rose from their
raw plywood table and ducked through a doorway, leaving their
playing cards behind.
</P>
<P>
   When they understood that their visitor was an American
journalist and not someone from a Serbian paramilitary unit, they
invited him in for coffee. Suddenly the empty street filled with
people, as if created from the dust.
</P>
<P>
   In a cool interior courtyard, under the shade of vines, more
than 60 Albanians of all ages sat and stood and listened and talked
about what had happened in this town in Kosovo in the war that they
cannot quite believe is now ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frightened and are still frightened, and for months we
stayed home, out of sight,'' said Hamdia, 46. ``We sat at home and
almost never dared even to go down the street. When we saw your
car, even now, we became frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still shooting at night, another man said in English.
``Until we see the Americans come,'' he said, ``we won't know it's
really over.'' Until then, he said, he would prefer not to provide
his name. ``Come back in 10 days,'' he said, ``and you can have all
our names.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnjilane, 30 miles southeast of Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
will be the headquarters of the American contingent of the U.N.
peacekeeping force that is about to move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, sleepy Gnjilane and its suburbs contained about
120,000 people, 30 percent of them Serbs, said Zoran Aksic, the
head of the city's executive, who promised full cooperation with
the American troops.
</P>
<P>
   Aksic insisted that nearly all of the city's Albanians remained
here, but the Albanians themselves said that at least 30 percent
had fled to Macedonia, including nearly the entire Albanian
population of the surrounding villages, where the Kosovo Liberation
Army had support.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group, an essentially rural movement, was never a
factor in Gnjilane, which was considered a Serbian stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   But in this interim period, when power is unclear and no one
understands how the West's occupation will work, Serbs here are
worried about retaliation. And some Albanians here admitted that
they were nervous about how the KLA will react to those who had
worked with the Serbs, or who chose to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had very little contact with the KLA or our Albanian
leaders,'' Hamdia said carefully. ``We just want to live in peace
and freedom and have no one touch us.'' He said he still favored
the nonviolent policies advocated by ethnic-Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger English-speaker said the KLA and its platform of
independence was the only logical conclusion to 10 years of Serbian
oppression. ``I think Rugova is politically finished,'' he said.
``His peaceful politics was a catastrophe over the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he and others said there was little thirst for revenge
among ordinary Albanians. At the same time, they expressed little
regret ``if those Serbs who committed crimes against people became
frightened now and left Kosovo,'' another man said. ``The ones with
dirt or blood on their hands will run away. And those Gypsies who
helped the Serbs, because of their fear, they will also leave. They
knew that they committed crimes against their neighbors, which no
human being should do. But we will never force them to leave as
they forced us to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Gnjilane is an interesting case, because relatively few of the
Albanians of the town _ unlike the villagers _ were in fact ordered
to leave. But the whole Albanian population lived in unremitting
fear of the Serbs, becoming prisoners in their own homes. They
heard on the radio what Serbs were doing to other Albanians in
Kosovo, and they tried to repress their nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing that began March 24 set off a fierce round of
Serbian violence against the Albanians and their property that
lasted nearly two weeks, these Albanians said. ``With the NATO
bombing, the Serbs became more aggressive,'' another Albanian man
said, while the others nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They burned everything in the night, so they couldn't be
recognized,'' another said. ``They burned shops and some houses at
the crossroads. But there was no attack on the people or on those
in this street.''
</P>
<P>
   When some Albanians here did venture out, they were sometimes
harassed and beaten by Serbian paramilitaries wearing black masks
and black uniforms. Some of those masked men, they said, were
probably local Serbs who did not want to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   In general, they said, they simply remained behind the walls of
their compounds and did not venture further into town. They
organized a neighborhood watch system to patrol the street at
night. They ate from stocks of food at home. A middleman came and
sold them flour at more than three times the normal price.
</P>
<P>
   Once, they sent some women from the street out to buy food. They
took a bus west to Bujanovac, a mostly Albanian town just outside
Kosovo. They were ordered off the bus at a checkpoint by police and
made to walk 15 miles, they said.
</P>
<P>
   One man described hearing second-hand of the murder of Albanians
in a small village eight miles southeast of here. He said a
survivor told him that Serbian paramilitaries had killed 13 people
in one house who resisted them and then burned the bodies. He said
that three children and a man of 30 were wounded but survived,
spending three weeks in the hospital. But he would not provide
their names.
</P>
<P>
   The English-speaker, younger and more politically radical, said
everyone here was grateful to NATO and to the United States. But he
said there was little real information available, and that the
situation in the town remained very complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the deciding days, the days of transition,'' he
said. ``It's always most dangerous at the end,'' he said, then
laughed. ``And there is never an end.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He and the others said they fear that Yugoslavia's defeat will
produce a last spasm of violence from angry Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That fear is shared by a Serbian police sergeant named Milan,
who spoke over coffee at the Atele coffee bar, across from a huge,
ugly statue of Prince Lazar, the Serbian commander who lost nobly
to the Turks in 1389 and who is revered as a saint.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are full of anger,'' he said, as a form of warning to
the Americans to step carefully here. ``If a Serb is murdered by an
Albanian, and it will happen, it could begin something terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he claimed, two soldiers had their throats cut in the
village of Gadis, 15 miles west of here; and in Orahovac, near
Djakovica, three Serbs were killed on their doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, too, is full of anger and grief, but he considers himself
a professional. Although he was born here, he has orders to leave
with the rest of the Serbian police, and he will go. What happens
next, he said, ``will be no bigger surprise than what has already
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road back to Pristina, a large house was burning. Long
columns of military trucks filled with soldiers, field artillery
and the feared Praga anti-aircraft guns, often used to destroy the
brick walls of Albanian houses, roared away from Kosovo. The
Yugoslav army continued to beat its long retreat, and the Albanians
of Gnjilane waited for the moment that their fear might end, and
they might finally stroll the streets of their town.

   JERUSALEM _ Israel is called the Silicon Valley of the Middle
East because so many new technology companies get started there.
But the country differs from the California original in one crucial
respect: Fledgling companies must leave the nest to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Long on trained technologists, thanks to universal military
service, Israel also has always abounded in entrepreneurial spirit.
But turning a bright idea into a thriving business requires three
more ingredients _ capital, customers and experienced managers _
that are scarcer here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis are strong on innovation and technology but weak on
business models and strategy,'' said Samuel Rockman, managing
director of Isratec, a Jerusalem company that provides marketing
and financial advisory services for high-technology business. He
added that executive training and graduate schools of business had
appeared only recently in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   So ambitious Israeli companies are looking abroad for money,
markets and especially management, and the search usually leads
directly to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. marketplace is where the de facto leaders are
defined,'' said Nir Barkat, managing director at BRM, an investment
banking and consulting firm here specializing in high technology
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Some 82 Israeli companies, mainly technology firms, have tapped
American capital markets by listing their stocks on the New York
Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, far more than from any other country of
similar size.
</P>
<P>
   At least 150 Israeli technology companies have set up executive
or marketing offices in Boston, Washington or California, and
scores more dispatch senior executives to America for months at a
time. Barkat's firm, which teams up with entrepreneurs to turn seed
ideas into companies, often recommends establishing research and
development centers in Israel while sending company entrepreneurs
to the United States to test the business concept.
</P>
<P>
   Ely Razin, a Canadian lawyer, took that approach when he started
Expert Ease, a company that develops legal software, in Israel in
1995. He found himself shuttling between research headquarters in
Jerusalem and a marketing office in New York for the first two
years. ``If we had been started by some stellar engineer, we would
have been run aground years ago,'' Razin said. ``An engineer type
wouldn't know how to raise money, wouldn't have known how to push
to get something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkat of BRM said: ``The challenges aren't trivial. Israelis
and Americans both speak English, but they come from very different
cultures.'' A tendency toward secretiveness and reluctance to
relinquish control are more common among Israeli business people
than Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Maxwell, president of Commtouch, an Israeli-conceived and
San Francisco-based developer of consumer e-mail applications,
agreed that cultural barriers can be major issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we bring is an American face to the company,'' explained
Ms. Maxwell, who is British and is the daughter of Robert Maxwell,
the late media baron. ``Americans are funny that way; it helps to
have less of an accent when working with them.'' And the work gets
done because of the Israeli military culture and its work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're able to accomplish is highly complementary to one
another,'' Ms. Maxwell said. ``The Israelis have the prescience to
choose the market well and a lack of ego to allow someone else in
to help achieve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Commtouch, which was established in 1991 and counts Business
Week, Excite and Nippon Telephone and Telegraph among its clients,
is the quintessential Israeli start-up. The company's chief
executive, chief financial officer and marketing operation are in
San Francisco, while research and development are based in an old
egg warehouse in Ein Vered, an Israeli farming cooperative.
Analysts value the company, which has filed plans to go public, at
$150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maxwell, co-founder of the Magellan online guide acquired by
Excite in 1996, considered other California-based Internet
start-ups, but felt a pull toward Commtouch and the Israeli
connection. ``The people and the product seemed great, but it was
an affair of the heart,'' said Ms. Maxwell, whose father is buried
in Jerusalem.  &QL;

MEET THE NEW BIG GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are, as nearly as I can tell, three Big Guys in
present-day American magazine journalism, as distinct from
newspapering. They are James Fallows, Michael Kinsley and, now,
Andrew Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter to readers of a business page who and how many
are in a tiny circle at the top of the opinion-making trade? Of
course it does, because such skirmishers have disproportionate
influence on taste. They become journalistic avatars associated
with the presidencies in which they came of age: Carter, Reagan,
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows is 49, Kinsley 48, Sullivan 35.
</P>
<P>
   Each served for a time as editor of a highly visible magazine _
US News and World Report (Fallows), The New Republic (Kinsley and
Sullivan), Slate (Kinsley) at the pleasure of an
intellectual/financial impressario: the Washington Monthly's
Charles Peters, The New Republic's Martin Peretz and Mortimer
Zuckerman, owner of The Atlantic Monthly and US News.?
</P>
<P>
   Each has written widely, taking sufficently strong positions on
a wide array of leading issues of the day. (Kurt Andersen, an
influential editor who co-founded Spy magazine in the mid-1980s,
might otherwise be a Big Guy, except that characteristically he has
written a hilarious novel, ``Turn of the Century,'' instead of a
tract, and keeps up a weekly column in the New Yorker.)
</P>
<P>
   It also happens that each of the three has made a splash _
Sullivan most recently _ by taking a strong position on global
business' favorite magazine, the London Economist. Surely there is
some information in that.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1988 that Kinsley quit his job as editor of The New
Republic to edit from London the magazine's American Survey _ a few
pages near the front of the book each week. ``An export item, like
Crabtree and Evelyn soap,'' he later described it. ``Americans buy
it because they assume it is an important institution in Britain.''
Yet he brought more than a little of his economic sophistication
back home.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Washington Post three years later, the famously
dirigiste Fallows asserted that The Economist ``unwholesomely
purveys smarty-pants English attitudes on our shores.'' It had
become a sacred cow among America's professional class by asserting
its preference for markets over management in a tart English
accent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Its circulation had risen from 40,000 when Ronald Reagan took
office to 183,000 in 1991, he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Today its American circulation tops 300,000, and earlier this
month Andrew Sullivan wrote in The New Republic that ``Apart from
Austin Powers, there can be few British institutions as groovy
right now as The Economist.'' Everybody agrees, he said: Der
Spiegel, Vanity Fair, London's Sunday Telegraph, Anthony Lewis,
Bill Gates and Larry Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the closer you look at the magazine, according to Sullivan,
the more ordinary it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist is drifting, he wrote. Its American Survey is out
of touch and unoriginal (except for variations on the theme of
whimsical condescension), its coverage of business and finance
overshadowed by the more original reporting of others, its market
intelligence lacking (we're still waiting for $5 oil) and its world
historical compass spinning (Kosovo? its prescriptions have been
``remarkably slithery'').
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to its vaunted analysis, (The Economist) has
shown a remarkable capacity over the past couple of years to be
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Now The Economist been publishing for 156 years, and by any
standard, it is among the most successful of all magazines. Time
and Newsweek, which also aim to furnish readers with a certain
Weltanschauung by the device of summarizing the news, are still
vital, but forever trembling on the brink of metamorphosis.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist, however, was founded in the aftermath of the
Napoleonic Wars to expressly espouse basic principles of free trade
and political economy. And by steering a steady course ever since,
and by concentrating on top end of the world market, it has
furnished an extremely comfortable niche.
</P>
<P>
   It rode to its current prominence in the '70s and '80s on the
strength of four broad insights propounded again and again: that
the world was not running out of oil, that the command economies of
the Soviet Union and China were falling behind, that among the
industrial democracies America was in the van, and that Japan was
not going to take over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In this program it embedded enough hard-headed original
reporting of politics, culture and science that it became, for a
time at least, a sort of de facto agenda among those who take
seriously modern management and economics.
</P>
<P>
   It is true there is a widespread feeling that The Economist is
off its recent peak, that it has ceased to be the straw that stirs
the drink. It is this feeling to which Sullivan gave vent. Indeed,
it is hard to credit the omniscience of any voice that so
frequently and completely failed to understand the significance of
events surrounding the impeachment of Bill Clinton. ``Just go,''
thundered the cover at a certain point, demanding Clinton's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan offered two reasons why ``the paper'' (as its staffers
know it) may find itself adrift. The first reason boils down to too
much Magdalen. The Oxford college (``probably the finest academic
institution in the world'') certainly has produced a huge
proportion of current staffers. The editor, his deputy and the New
York bureau chief are graduates, as were three of the four
runners-up for the top job. So is Andrew Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Such clannishness is fine for producing a distinctive voice, he
says, but it's not much on generating the necessary negative
feedback. (He doesn't mention the American executive, Marjorie
Scardino, who oversees the conglomerate that owns the magazine.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is in the nature of things that these curious pockets of
excellence should crop up in colleges and in the papers to which
their graduates flock after graduation. The Harvard Crimson is like
this, too, to mention another obvious example, a self-selecting
group of peers who may be prone to excess in any given year. (Both
Fallows and Kinsley are former Crimson editors.)
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because some members of each new cohort want to be
what their predecessors were not, there is a kind of
self-correcting cycle built into organizations of this sort,
sufficient to provide renewal over a relatively short period of
time. The wheel within the wheel turns, thanks to the competition
among generations. Meanwhile, just as the Crimson goes on being
Cambridge's only breakfast daily, no matter where the in the cycle
it?, so The Economist remains the world's business weekly,
regardless of its editors' blind spots. Business schools teach from
it; a huge user group is involved in maintaining its relevance. The
Financial Times provides salutary competition as well.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to mark is Sullivan's second explanation of the funk,
that perhaps The Economist is another victim of the peace. ``Until
the 1990s, it had a definite role in promoting the free-market
revolution, pioneering such concepts as deregulation, privatization
and globalization.'' The magazine's liberal bent on social issues
attracted a wider following than simply market professionals. But
then the Cold War ended. ``With the end of such an ideology, the
magazine has wandered,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Has the era of market liberalism in fact ended? That's where
Sullivan comes in. Until recently, he was best known as a writer on
gay issues. There have been a pair of books: ``Virtually Normal'' a
strong brief for same-sex marriage; and ``Love Undetectable'' about
the effect of AIDS on homosexual culture. (Sullivan is gay.)
</P>
<P>
   But a remarkable piece on American conservatism in The New York
Times Sunday Magazine at exactly the right moment last autumn _
``Going Down Screaming'' _ drove home Sullivan's reputation as a
political analyst. (He writes a weekly column on American politics
for the Sunday Times of London.) Sullivan has become the newest of
the Big Guys. His decent, conservative, Catholic views, which
routinely go far beyond the measuring rod of money, illuminate the
temper of his times. The political future increasingly belongs to
those born after 1968.

   COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS (Undated) _ The signs have been evident for
several months: top high school seniors rejected by colleges of
their choice, second-tier institutions overwhelmed with excellent
applications, state universities raising admission requirements.
Now, interviews with scores of college and school officials and
preliminary statistics, appear to confirm what stunned high school

   CALIF-LA-SUBWAY (Los Angeles) _ For a brief moment Friday
morning, the cream of the Los Angeles political establishment could
be found deep underground, doing something that residents of this
sprawling, car-crazed city hardly ever do: riding the subway. And
not just any subway, but the five spanking new stops under
Hollywood that, after two decades of striving, setbacks and
billions of dollars, have finally brought the system to just over
11 miles of underground track. By Todd S. Purdum.

<TEXT>
<P>
   An unfortunate consequence of the long bull market in stocks is
that investors are paying precious little attention to asset
allocation _ the division of their holdings between various asset
classes like stocks, bonds and real estate. They have been lured by
stocks' huge returns into thinking that equities are the only game
in town.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption is costly, and not just because the run-up in
stocks won't last forever. By focusing only on equities, investors
are also paying too high a price whenever they want to reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you are invested only in stocks, but want to reduce
your risk by one-half. One way to do that, of course, is to
withdraw half your assets from the stock market and put them in
cash instead.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, your new portfolio will indeed be only half as risky
as the stock market, but your returns will be only be half as much
(plus the interest earned by the cash). Over the last 10 years
through April 30, the returns of a portfolio that was 50 percent
invested in the Wilshire 5000, a broad stock index, and 50 percent
in cash would have been 11.5 percent, annualized, or 6.2 percentage
points less than a pure equity portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding your allocation focus beyond stocks and cash,
however, you could improve returns without incurring any more risk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, a fixed-allocation portfolio that was 41
percent in stocks and 59 percent in United States government bonds,
for example, would have been no more risky than the half
stocks-half cash portfolio. Yet it would have returned 12.5 percent
annualized, or one percentage point more.
</P>
<P>
   That extra percentage point is the payoff of effective asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   Asset allocation works because the various asset classes don't
move in lock step. When one is declining, at least one of the
others will usually be rising. The right combination can reduce
overall volatility _ and risk _ by flattening the peaks and troughs
of each class' performance. And because stocks, bonds and other
classes historically outperform cash, a good asset allocation
portfolio should outperform one that uses cash alone to reduce
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of asset allocation can be seen in the
performance of investment newsletters that focus on it explicitly.
Though none of the 10 such newsletters tracked by The Hulbert
Financial Digest over the last decade through April 30 have beaten
the overall stock market through that period, six of them have
outperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis. That is
significant, because the vast majority of newsletters that use
other strategies for beating the market _ like market timing or
stock selection _ have failed to keep pace with the stock market
when adjusted for risk.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that advisers who focus on asset allocation are smarter
than the others. When these same advisers have tried their hands at
market timing or stock selection, most of them have also failed to
beat the market. The lesson to draw is that it's easier to beat the
stock market when you expand your focus beyond equities to include
several asset classes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not interested in reducing risk, asset allocation
is still worthwhile. Using an example that may not be altogether
realistic for all investors, let's reconsider that portfolio
containing 41 percent stocks and 59 percent bonds. How would it
have performed over the last decade if you had doubled the original
amount invested, say by borrowing the additional money?
</P>
<P>
   Your risk would have been the same as that of the stock market
itself, but you would have realized a greater return, even after
paying interest on the amounts borrowed. You would have made a 19.8
percent annualized profit over the 10 years through April 30, or
2.2 percentage points more than the 17.7 percent return of stocks
themselves.

   KOSOVO-MAIN _ ABLE SENTRY BASE _ NATO forces, led by British

to Kosovo Saturday as Serb troops continued their pullout.
Meanwhile, a Russian convoy stationed in Bosnia headed toward
Kosovo, intensifying the debate about Moscow's role in the
peacekeeping force. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
visited refugees and troops in Macedonia. As President Clinton
greeted military personnel and their families during a visit to
Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., he was asked: ``What about the
Russians?'' ``We?ll work it out,'' the president replied.

an abortion in Florida since Roe v. Wade. The law, sure to be
challenged in court, requires that the parents of a girl under 18
to be notified if she is going to have an abortion. Civil

   WORM _ ATLANTA _ Even as the FBI was trying to trace the source
of the Explorer worm that infected computers worldwide Thursday and
Friday, most organizations and companies that had been hit by it
purged the infection after a few hours. Observers say the worm's
impact was lessened by the fact that it came just a few weeks after
the less-harmful Meliss virus, which prompted many computer
networks to strengthen their protection systems. (Clothier, Atlanta

<P>
   ALABAMA-LIQUOR _ Alabama state attorneys say the Legislature
approved a bill that would make Sunday liquor sales legal statewide

approving, and Gov. Don Siegelman has not decided if he will sign
it. Sen. Tom Butler, D-Madison, said Friday that Siegelman told him
he would not approve the bill. Butler said the measure contains
some ``crafty wording'' by an attorney who apparently wrote it. But
the governor's press secretary, Kristin Carvell, said several hours
later that Siegelman has not decided whether to sign the bill.

   POGO _ WASHINGTON _ The Project on Government Oversight, a
little-known group that labors for low pay in search of fraud and
inefficiency in government, is being accused of bribing an Interior
Department employee. A POGO lawsuit recently forced Mobil Oil Co.
to pay the government $45 million in back royalties for oil pumped
from taxpayer-owned land. As part of the settlement, $1.2 million
went to POGO, which chose to make $350,000 ``grants'' to two
bureaucrats, one retired. The organization said the money was to
reward the bureaucrats for ``putting their jobs on the line'' by
pressing for action to force repaymenty of royalties. But House
Resources Committee Chairman Don Young says the ``grant'' to a
current federal employee was an illegal payoff. Cheered by oil
company lawyers, Young has launched an investigation.

   WORM _ ATLANTA _ Even as the FBI was trying to trace the source
of the Explorer worm that infected computers worldwide Thursday and
Friday, most organizations and companies that had been hit by it
purged the infection after a few hours. Observers say the worm's

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arden Armstrong, lead manager of the $887.6 million MAS Mid-Cap
Growth fund, cheerfully acknowledges the growth-oriented nature of
her investing discipline. She asks only that her style not be
confused with the methods of other growth-fund managers. ``We like
to find quality growth,'' she explained from her office in West
Conshohocken, Pa. ``We're not momentum or
growth-at-a-reasonable-price investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Three elements characterize what she calls ``quality growth''
companies: projected annual earnings growth of more than 15 percent
over the next one to three years, expanding profit margins over the
same period and consistency in the profit growth _ to rule out
companies benefiting from unusual conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The fund seems to have benefited from the formula. MAS Mid-Cap
returned 25.9 percent, annualized, for the three years ended June
4, compared with 12.3 percent for its peer group of mid-cap growth
funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher, and 27.6 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, individuals have been able to buy fund shares
through through financial advisers; the fund was previously
available only to institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong, 38, begins the stock-selection process with a
computer program that looks at the 2,500 or so companies traded on
United States exchanges that have market capitalizations of $500
million to $5 billion. About 40 percent of them have the quality
earnings characteristics she seeks and become candidates for
further research, which she does with the help of two co-managers
and eight analysts. They whittle down their list to the 90 or so
stocks in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The research focuses on whether Wall Street earnings estimates
are sustainable. On company balance sheets, she looks for lean
inventories and low totals in accounts receivable and in working
capital _ a sign of a company that operates efficiently, producing
excess cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   She also reviews companies' market position. ``In small-cap and
mid-cap investing,'' she said, ``you can end up with little
companies that compete with big companies.'' She avoids those small
companies because they risk being overwhelmed and looks instead for
those that are industry leaders in fragmented industries or that
dominate in narrow market niches.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-third of the portfolio is always allocated to
aggressive-growth stocks _ with rates of earnings growth above 25
percent _ and another third to more stable growth companies. The
remainder shifts between those two categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've trimmed our holdings in the stable growers because we're
trying to get more economically sensitive stocks that are poised to
benefit from a better global economy, like semiconductor or energy
stocks,'' she said. ``These are a little more cyclical, but I think
we're in the right point in the cycle for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The price she will pay varies. If a company has a very stable
growth rate, she's willing to pay a price-to earnings multiple that
is higher than the comparable earnings growth rate. For cyclical
growth companies with low profit margins and no excess cash flow,
she is likely to pay a multiple that is only 60 percent to 80
percent of the comparable growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   She bought CNF Transportation, a Palo Alto, Calif., air carrier
and trucking company, for $44 a share in January. ``Merchandise
bought over the Internet is generally shipped by the U.S. post
office, and CNF has a contract with the post office for providing
transportation for priority mail on the East Coast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   CNF owns Emery Worldwide, a shipping company that has suffered
over the last two years as many foreign economies stumbled. But CNF
has cut costs and improved service, she said, and its earnings
should improve as economic activity picks up abroad. Analysts
expect earnings to grow 14.3 percent annually over the next three
years. The stock now trades at $39.25, or 11.7 times the earnings
of $3.36 a share that analysts estimate for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong began buying General Instrument, which makes
analog cable set-top boxes, at $20 a share in April 1998, hoping to
profit from the cable TV boom. The company has been introducing
digital cable versions of its boxes, she said, and is upgrading its
equipment to provide modem and telephone services.
</P>
<P>
   General Instrument had a 1998 net profit margin of 10.9 percent.
Wall Street expects earnings to grow 23.5 percent a year over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock now trades at $38.25, or 32.7 times expected 2000
earnings of $1.17 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The fund recently added to its position in Premier Parks, which
it originally bought in 1997 at $16 a share. The company, based in
Oklahoma City, acquired the Six Flags theme parks and name from
Time Warner last year and has been rechristening the larger parks
it already owned with the Six Flags name.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armstrong says the company is likely to see steady growth
because its parks are used by day-trippers and are not as sensitive
to the economy as parks requiring longer stays.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is an acquisition-driven company, Ms. Armstrong looks
at Premier Parks' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization which she expects to grow 22 percent a year over the
next three years. The stock now trades at $37.50.  &QL;

 &HT;    Songs of devotion
 &HT;    (Eds: Moving in lifestyle and entertainment categories.)
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, Word Records and Myrrh Records released the
first of a series of recordings called ``My Utmost for His
Highest,'' original songs by some of the top voices in contemporary
Christian music that were inspired by the classic devotional of the
same name by Oswald Chambers. At the same time, an updated edition
of the book was published.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad strategy: Use music, a main medium of communication
for the rock-'n'-roll-and-beyond generations, to entice listeners
to check out the written word.
</P>
<P>
   The record was well-received, earning the Gospel Music
Association's Dove Award for special event of the year in 1996, the
book sold and the marketing idea caught on so well that Word
recently released two similar projects. They take slightly
different approaches, but both are worthy, and one stands out among
the best music of 1999. Word introduced them to the press and
Christian music industry in April at a concert during Gospel Music
Week in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Songs From The Book,'' which came out May 18, is the more
obvious promotional tool. ``The Book'' is a special edition of the
New Living Translation of the Bible, which was published by Tyndale
House in 1996. Citing polls by Gallup and Barna that almost 90
million Americans have not read the Bible, Word and Tyndale House
are partnering with the Christian Broadcasting Network on a $7
million media blitz to try to add more than 10 million readers for
``The Book'' _ and sell a bunch of Bibles. Part of the marketing
drive will include ads featuring Kathie Lee Gifford, Roma Downing,
Reggie White, Tara Lipinski and others.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 14 ``Songs From The Book'' are written for the
project. Michael Card gets things off to a rousing start with ``The
Book.'' Jerry McPherson's bouzouki tosses in a little Greek
seasoning to this otherwise Celtic-flavored cut. The harmonies and
cool urban stylings of Anointed are featured in ``The Word,'' which
speaks of the comfort and practical counsel offered in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Two modern classics, however, have been reworked by different
artists. The first radio single is ``El Shaddai,'' the CCM hymn
written by Card and John Thompson in 1981 that became a signature
song for Amy Grant. However, signaling that the song has been
handed off to a new generation, the song is performed here by
Winans Phase 2, cousins who are the sons of the Winans brothers.
Their slightly R&AMP;B interpretation is smooth and every bit as
reverent as previous ones, and Grant offers her stamp of approval
by singing backing vocals. In the Nashville concert during GMA
Week, she joined the group on stage for a duet that was among the
night's highlights. That night, Grant also shared a nostalgic duet
with Michael W. Smith on a song they co-wrote, ``Thy Word.'' Here
that song is performed by Ginny Owens, a recent addition to Smith's
Rocketown label, who is able to capture some of the same innocence
and earnestness that made Grant's 1984 recording so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Sixpence None the Richer, which has caused major mainstream buzz
with its little love song ``Kiss Me,'' offers a remake of its own
song, ``Trust,'' a confession of childlike faith with a chorus that
etches itself in the mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The other songs are previously released material such as Crystal
Lewis' duet with Ron Kenoly, ``Beauty for Ashes,'' Jaci Velasquez's
hit from last year, ``God So Loved,'' and this year's Dove winner
for song of the year, ``My Deliverer,'' by The Ragamuffins. While
all are good songs well done, they've received so much exposure
that their inclusion here seems almost overkill. Not so with two
songs that were part of the first ``My Utmost for His Highest:
Sometimes He Comes in the Clouds,'' by Steven Curtis Chapman, and
``You Are Holy,'' by 4Him, are worth reviving.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Songs From The Book'' plays like a collection of
disparate if well-crafted songs, the other Word project,
``Streams,'' is remarkable for its continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Released June 1, ``Streams'' is connected with an updated 1997
edition of the ``Streams in the Desert'' devotional by L.B. Cowman
that was edited by James Reimann for Zondervan Publishing. While
dollar figures weren't announced for the publicity push, Christian
retailers have had promotional material for a month, and floor
displays contain both the CD and a newly released edition of the
devotional, with a blue cover to match the disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streams,'' too, has connections with ``My Utmost for His
Highest.'' Word Entertainment President Loren Balman, who was
executive producer of ``My Utmost,'' has the same task here. He and
producer Brent Bourgeois have created a wonderful, unified work by
repeatedly using complementary songwriters, such as Cindy Morgan
and Michelle Tumes; collaborating on some of the songs themselves;
having singers do vocals on numbers they didn't write; and using
the musicians, including the Irish Film Orchestra, to even things
out where needed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its goal of providing ``songs of hope, healing and
restoration,'' this is no rock album, and its slower tempo might
take awhile to appreciate. But it is well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job,'' written by Morgan and Balman and sung by Morgan, sets
the pace with a melancholy rendering of the Old Testament character
beset by problems he doesn't understand, full of questions and
doubts but determined not to give up on God. Morgan's passionate,
plaintive rendering of the chorus (``All I have is Yours/All these
ashes and these sores/All that I am living for/I will follow you to
shore'') is possibly the best vocal performance of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streams'' also manages to group singers in unusual
combinations successfully. Remember Peter Gabriel's ``Don't Give
Up'' from the '80s? Here the song is reworked slightly to make God,
with the voice of the Doobie Brothers' Michael McDonald, the one
who comforts Maire Brennan, the Irish singer from Clannad.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois' ``The Only Thing I Need,'' one of the more upbeat
cuts, features 4Him and Jon Anderson of Yes. With vocals starting
out like the pealing of bells, 4Him, sans Anderson, carried this
off without a hitch at the GMA concert.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most unexpected pairing is British rockers Delirious
with Grant on ``Find Me in the River.'' The original version of the
song appeared on the group's ``Cutting Edge'' disc on Sparrow.
Here, however, Grant's harmony, which takes advantage of her
constantly-improving lower register, gives the song added
grounding. ``Find Me in the River'' becomes a song of determination
in the midst of pain; its soulful electric guitar becomes almost
another vocalist, and the loops by Tedd T. add an ethereal edge
that implies perseverance is not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing are Jaci Velasquez, Tumes, Sixpence None the
Richer again, Chris Rodriguez, Point of Grace and, perhaps the
oddest fit, Burlap to Cashmere. The trademark acoustic guitarwork
of Johnny Philippides and vocal of Steve Delopoulos make this cut
stick out a little stylistically, but Uileann pipes and low whistle
keep it from veering too far off course.
</P>
<P>
   In one last twist, ``Streams'' wraps up with a four-song
orchestral suite. Typically, instrumentals are interspersed
throughout a project, but by grouping them, ``Streams'' leaves the
listener feeling rested and restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streams'' will set the standard for any like-minded project in
the future, and judging from how well several numbers worked live
in Nashville, don't be surprised if a ``Streams'' tour flows into a
venue near you.

   Only two of the 14 ``Songs From The Book'' are written for the
project. Michael Card gets things off to a rousing start with ``The
Book.'' Jerry McPherson's bouzouki tosses in a little Greek
seasoning to this otherwise Celtic-flavored cut. The harmonies and
cool urban stylings of Anointed are featured in ``The Word,'' which
speaks of the comfort and practical counsel offered in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Two modern classics, however, have been reworked by different
artists. The first radio single is ``El Shaddai,'' the CCM hymn
written by Card and John Thompson in 1981 that became a signature
song for Amy Grant. However, signaling that the song has been
handed off to a new generation, the song is performed here by
Winans Phase 2, cousins who are the sons of the Winans brothers.
Their slightly R&AMP;B interpretation is smooth and every bit as
reverent as previous ones, and Grant offers her stamp of approval
by singing backing vocals. In the Nashville concert during GMA
Week, she joined the group on stage for a duet that was among the
night's highlights. That night, Grant also shared a nostalgic duet
with Michael W. Smith on a song they co-wrote, ``Thy Word.'' Here
that song is performed by Ginny Owens, a recent addition to Smith's
Rocketown label, who is able to capture some of the same innocence
and earnestness that made Grant's 1984 recording so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Sixpence None the Richer, which has caused major mainstream buzz
with its little love song ``Kiss Me,'' offers a remake of its own
song, ``Trust,'' a confession of childlike faith with a chorus that
etches itself in the mind and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The other songs are previously released material such as Crystal
Lewis' duet with Ron Kenoly, ``Beauty for Ashes,'' Jaci Velasquez's
hit from last year, ``God So Loved,'' and this year's Dove winner
for song of the year, ``My Deliverer,'' by The Ragamuffins. While
all are good songs well done, they've received so much exposure
that their inclusion here seems almost overkill. Not so with two
songs that were part of the first ``My Utmost for His Highest:
Sometimes He Comes in the Clouds,'' by Steven Curtis Chapman, and
``You Are Holy,'' by 4Him, are worth reviving.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Songs From The Book'' plays like a collection of
disparate if well-crafted songs, the other Word project,
``Streams,'' is remarkable for its continuity.
</P>
<P>
   Released June 1, ``Streams'' is connected with an updated 1997
edition of the ``Streams in the Desert'' devotional by L.B. Cowman
that was edited by James Reimann for Zondervan Publishing. While
dollar figures weren't announced for the publicity push, Christian
retailers have had promotional material for a month, and floor
displays contain both the CD and a newly released edition of the
devotional, with a blue cover to match the disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streams,'' too, has connections with ``My Utmost for His
Highest.'' Word Entertainment President Loren Balman, who was
executive producer of ``My Utmost,'' has the same task here. He and
producer Brent Bourgeois have created a wonderful, unified work by
repeatedly using complementary songwriters, such as Cindy Morgan
and Michelle Tumes; collaborating on some of the songs themselves;
having singers do vocals on numbers they didn't write; and using
the musicians, including the Irish Film Orchestra, to even things
out where needed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its goal of providing ``songs of hope, healing and
restoration,'' this is no rock album, and its slower tempo might
take awhile to appreciate. But it is well worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job,'' written by Morgan and Balman and sung by Morgan, sets
the pace with a melancholy rendering of the Old Testament character
beset by problems he doesn't understand, full of questions and
doubts but determined not to give up on God. Morgan's passionate,
plaintive rendering of the chorus (``All I have is Yours/All these
ashes and these sores/All that I am living for/I will follow you to
shore'') is possibly the best vocal performance of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streams'' also manages to group singers in unusual
combinations successfully. Remember Peter Gabriel's ``Don't Give
Up'' from the '80s? Here the song is reworked slightly to make God,
with the voice of the Doobie Brothers' Michael McDonald, the one
who comforts Maire Brennan, the Irish singer from Clannad.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois' ``The Only Thing I Need,'' one of the more upbeat
cuts, features 4Him and Jon Anderson of Yes. With vocals starting
out like the pealing of bells, 4Him, sans Anderson, carried this
off without a hitch at the GMA concert.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most unexpected pairing is British rockers Delirious
with Grant on ``Find Me in the River.'' The original version of the
song appeared on the group's ``Cutting Edge'' disc on Sparrow.
Here, however, Grant's harmony, which takes advantage of her
constantly-improving lower register, gives the song added
grounding. ``Find Me in the River'' becomes a song of determination
in the midst of pain; its soulful electric guitar becomes almost
another vocalist, and the loops by Tedd T. add an ethereal edge
that implies perseverance is not in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing are Jaci Velasquez, Tumes, Sixpence None the
Richer again, Chris Rodriguez, Point of Grace and, perhaps the
oddest fit, Burlap to Cashmere. The trademark acoustic guitarwork
of Johnny Philippides and vocal of Steve Delopoulos make this cut
stick out a little stylistically, but Uileann pipes and low whistle
keep it from veering too far off course.
</P>
<P>
   In one last twist, ``Streams'' wraps up with a four-song
orchestral suite. Typically, instrumentals are interspersed
throughout a project, but by grouping them, ``Streams'' leaves the
listener feeling rested and restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Streams'' will set the standard for any like-minded project in
the future, and judging from how well several numbers worked live
in Nashville, don't be surprised if a ``Streams'' tour flows into a
venue near you.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Ocean clouds, showers and a few thunderstorms associated with a
low pressure system off the Middle Atlantic seaboard will move
unconventionally westward Saturday, affecting coastal areas from
Delaware to northern North Carolina. The unusual direction of the
low will result from the eastward-steering winds of the jet stream
almost completely receding over Canada.
</P>
<P>
   With languid steering winds over the Deep South, widely
separated showers and thunderstorms will move slowly, setting the
stage for protracted heavy rains over parts of Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. Flash flooding is possible
in spots. Isolated, slow-moving storms will also occur over parts
of Louisiana and eastern Texas, mainly just inland from the Gulf
Coast, where the leading edge of the sea breeze wedges under and
lifts humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated but potent thunderstorms will develop over high ground
from eastern Colorado to eastern New Mexico and the panhandle of
northwest Texas as weak but moist winds from the east are forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. A few of these storms could produce
large hail and damaging winds.
</P>
<P>
   Without robust steering winds, a front will only waver across
the Middle West from the central Plains to the western Great Lakes.
Clusters of showers and thunderstorms, a few severe and some with
heavy rain, will develop in the warm, humid air along and just
ahead of the front.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, onshore breezes will keep much of the Northeast
seaboard cool to mild while the interior warms dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tropical Catalysts
</P>
<P>
   Weak fronts whose southern ends touch the tropical Atlantic
Ocean are breeding grounds for tropical storms during the early
stages of hurricane season. Surface winds from the southeast ahead
of a front and winds from the northeast behind a front provide a
circulation of air over warm water _ a recipe that can lead to the
spin-up of storms. As summer progresses, fronts no longer reach the
tropics. Instead, disturbances moving west from Africa serve as
catalysts for tropical storms. Near November, African disturbances
fade and fronts reappear to spawn the last storms of the season.

GOP FRONT-RUNNER BUSH BRACES FOR NATIONAL PRESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush has had a down and up
relationship with the media.
</P>
<P>
   He snarled at reporters about their coverage of his father's
1992 presidential campaign. &UR;  &LR; He said journalists investigated his
personal life back then because they had been ''stirred up`` by
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after years of reaping ``good press'' as Texas governor, he
says the Texas media respect him. He is downright chummy with
reporters. He says he is jealous of their freedom to be
smart-alecks.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bush starts campaigning for president with the status of
front-runner for the Republican nomination, he may go back to
square one. Longtime observers of presidential campaign coverage
say the national press is ready to pounce on the Texas governor _
and that his powers of self-defense will be limited.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of things perhaps to come, the Wall Street Journal in
May ran a front-page story detailing unsavory rumors about Bush's
personal past that it acknowledged it could not verify.
</P>
<P>
   University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato wrote the book
that applied the term ``feeding frenzy'' to the fierce
concentration of media attention to political scandal, and he says
Bush is ripe for one or more such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can expect a classic feeding frenzy,'' Sabato said. ``You
cannot get 250 journalists together, representing every major news
organizations in the world, without an attempt by at least some of
these organizations to find fault and generate controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The press entourage on Bush's first campaign trip, which starts
Saturday, indeed may reach 250 people and includes news crews from
foreign publications. Bush spent Friday at fund-raisers in Chicago
and St. Louis before returning to Austin, Texas, to pick up the
traveling media and fly to Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters will try to bait Bush into making misguided or
embarrassing comments, Sabato said, and knowing about the ``gaffe
watch'' ahead of time will not necessarily protect Bush from making
such a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he watched his father go through it and even
though he has been elected (governor) twice, it will still be like
nothing he has ever imagined,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has recruited a campaign communications staff that is
experienced in trying to limit gaffes and the reaction to them. His
chief campaign spokesman is David Beckwith, who worked for Dan
Quayle during Quayle's gaffe-prone vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is also telling himself to exercise verbal self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to quip,'' he said. ``I am mindful though, I have to be
careful what I say. Otherwise it gets totally blown out of
proportion. It's going to take some discipline on my part not to
quip back when the quippers quip.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, what's a governor to do in the face of a media
onslaught?
</P>
<P>
   ``You do your homework,'' said University of Houston political
scientist Richard Murray. ``You sure don't want to play into the
suspicions of the national press that you are not well prepared. He
needs to be well prepared, and he needs to be well informed;
comfortable in discussing a wide range of topics beyond what a
governor has to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has hosted intense, lengthy meetings with foreign policy
experts, many hailing from his father's and Ronald Reagan's White
House administration, to bone up on presidential issues.
</P>
<P>
   It would also help, Murray said, if ``you know how to pronounce
Kosovars, and that it's `Greeks,' not `Grecians,' and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, hardly an experienced hand at foreign policy, did once
describe the residents of war-ravaged Kosovo as ``Kosovians'' _ the
kind of verbal mishap that can plague a candidate under intense
media scrutiny. He also recently referred to natives of Greece as
``Grecians.''
</P>
<P>
   In an April interview, Bush said he respects the media's role in
the political process. But, he added, he already senses the
hostility that comes with his position as the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain sense of, `We'll show this guy,''' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was miffed at reporters' attempts to portray his
inner thoughts and the essence of his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the profiles, and all the people trying to figure out what
I am all about and stuff, makes me a little uncomfortable,'' he
said. ``I think people trying to figure out my psyche, and
psychoanalysis _ I am not very good about that, and I know if I'm
not very good about it, they aren't either.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bush maintains friendly relations with individual reporters
in and out of Texas, to an unusual degree for a candidate from the
Republican Party, which often views the press as biased in favor of
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   During his father's presidential campaign, he forged friendships
with national political columnists who, one-by-one, have
interviewed the governor in Austin this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
He addresses some Houston Chronicle reporters by nicknames he has
coined. He sent a get-well card to a Chronicle reporter who
developed a a serious illness. On the other hand, he also did not
hesitate to call a midlevel Chronicle editor at home in the evening
this year to express misgivings about an article that was about to
be published.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The experts say Bush's media friendships might help him fend off
some of the hair-trigger news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to milk the symbiotic relationship, recognizing that
everything down the road is going to be adversarial,'' Murray said.
``You hope you build a pretty good foundation that will help you
ride out the rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato said Republican presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, a TV
commentator, showed in previous contests that having friends in the
right studios and newsrooms can help a campaign that theoretically
is covered on the same basis as the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan has gotten almost a free ride in some campaigns
because of his close association with CNN and many in the print
media,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sabato said Bush's pleasant media encounters in the past
will not help in any long-lasting way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (reporters) will turn on you the third day rather than
the first day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the Chronicle he doesn't consider ``the media'' a
monolith that takes a constant approach to his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between someone who takes time to
thoughtfully write a story and somebody who just slops stuff from
the Internet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's professed tolerance of media criticism also appears
to have its limits.
</P>
<P>
   In a May interview on ABC, he said that as part of the national
political system, the media plays ``a game to destroy somebody's
reputation.'' He has explained that he does not plan to go into
detail about his ``young and irresponsible'' days, and he has
refused to say whether he used marijuana or cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   When an Internet prankster created a Web site that lampoons
Bush's official Web site, Bush called him a ``garbage man'' and
added, ``There ought to be limits to freedom.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: ARTISTIC NOVELTY STILL NOVEL AT SPOLETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ The elderly theatergoer was eager for
enlightenment. ``Why do you have that masking tape on your back?''
she asked an actor sporting a black strip on his costume, between
the shoulder blades. ``It represents our skin color,'' replied the
actor, whose job it was to mingle with the audience just before the
curtain.
</P>
<P>
   She looked puzzled by the redundancy _ the actor was black _ but
it was a wonderful exchange all the same, this brief colloquy
between the older Southern woman and the young emissary from the
experimental wing of New York theater. The production for which
they had traveled to Spoleto Festival U.S.A. was a quirky,
modernist reworking of the 1939 low-country melodrama ``Mamba's
Daughters,'' by Target Margin Theater, a small downtown company
known as much for its curious visual flourishes (blue faux tattoos
on ear lobes and chins, for instance) as for its eclectic
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   It was a pleasant shock, arriving and finding a lack of
resistance to the director David Herskovits' quasi-radical ideas
about performance; Heather Gillespie, the lead actress of
``Mamba's,'' captivating here as in New York, received a thunderous
curtain call for her portrayal of an illiterate laborer with a
tender heart in Dorothy and DuBose Heyward's clunky drama.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, one could sense open-mindedness in the theaters of
Charleston toward the radical notions promulgated night after night
in Spoleto's offerings. Audiences were revved up for challenges,
whether they came by way of Laurie Anderson's synthesized worship
service in honor of the whale (in ``Songs and Stories From Moby
Dick'') or in the American debut of a political SOS in operatic
form by Kurt Weill (``Die Buergschaft'') or even in the
intellectual idiosyncrasies of a group of New York actors
performing a stodgy old play with pieces of masking tape on their
backs. (The tape being Herskovits' comment on the play's racial
hierarchies.)
</P>
<P>
   The festival has been throwing open this dewy city of antebellum
refinement and she-crab soup to artistic novelty for 22 years now.
And of course in an enterprise of this scope _ more than 100 dance,
opera, chamber music, jazz and theater performances take place over
17 days each spring _ the results are bound to vary. That is why
the forbearance of the Charleston audience is a decided blessing; a
little patience is in order in approaching the festival and
especially for its theatrical ventures, in all of their messy and
adventurous aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of Spoleto's theater is imported _ the visiting
productions included the sleight-of-hand of ``Ricky Jay and his 52
Assistants'' and the puppetry of Ping Chong in ``Kwaidan'' _ the
festival itself produced the American premiere of ``Die
Buergschaft'' (``The Pledge''). The caustic and prophetic 1932
opera, composed by Weill and with a libretto by Weill and Caspar
Neher, takes a figurative machete to the politics of the Nazi power
grab in Germany, the country that the Jewish Weill was soon to flee
and renounce.
</P>
<P>
   Weill, whose collaboration with Bertolt Brecht had all but ended
by the time of ``Die Buergschaft,'' straddled the worlds of opera
and theater. This was a circumstance vividly illustrated by the
director Jonathan Eaton's brooding, menacing Spoleto production.
The work's epic nature, its reliance on the power of parable, its
formalized emotions and its polemical call to arms all carry strong
echoes of Brecht. All these elements are vibrantly incorporated
into Eaton's staging of the opera, which plays as a three-hour
descent into an ever more dehumanized and mercenary version of
hell.
</P>
<P>
   Sung in German with English surtitles and conducted by Julius
Rudel, the tale unfolds in the land of Urb, a storybook nation of
inbred cynicism. ``People don't change; it's circumstances that
change the way they act,'' sings the chorus, perched throughout the
opera on double-decker platforms on each side of the Sottile
Theater stage. ``Die Buergschaft'' reiterates this sentiment again
and again in the story of the friendship of David Orth (Dale
Travis), a grain merchant, and Johann Mattes (Frederick Burchinal),
a cattleman, men of vastly different temperaments who degrade
themselves equally in the deprivation and profiteering that follows
Urb's occupation by a Gestapo-like ruling body.
</P>
<P>
   Danila Korogodsky's flimsy cardboard sets stand in contrast to
the opera's assertion of the immutability of man's character. Even
the placard the chorus flashes as a symbol of Orth's and Mattes'
bond, a spray-painted silhouette of their handshake, plays with the
idea of impermanence; theirs is a shadow of a friendship, easily
obscured.
</P>
<P>
   In its own time, ``Die Buergschaft'' must have seemed
terrifyingly potent: imagine an opera set today, say, in the
complicated killing fields of Rwanda or Chechnya. Weill's and
Neher's evocations of the Fascist threat, the opportunism of the
collaborators (embodied splendidly by the production's three
henchmen, played by Peter Lurie, Lawrence Craig and Herbert Perry)
and the struggles of the oppressed masses are both prescient and
almost journalistically precise.
</P>
<P>
   But the work lacks a galvanizing presence. There's no equivalent
of Macheath of ``Threepenny Opera''; neither Orth nor Mattes
emerges as a compelling figure in his own right. It is left to
Anna, Mattes' wife, portrayed to heart-rending effect by the
mezzo-soprano Margaret Thompson, to lay claim to an audience's
hopes and sympathies. (Ann Panagulias is nearly as haunting in the
role of the Mattes' daughter Luise, who turns to a life of
prostitution.) In the treatment by Eaton and Rudel, ``Die
Buergschaft'' is a fascinating if protracted piece of agitprop.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, the performance artist, is preoccupied by the epic
form as well. Her ``Songs and Stories From Moby Dick,'' which is to
be presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music later this season,
amounts to her own alternative telling of Melville's classic
American novel. One senses that Ms. Anderson is still in pursuit of
the elusive core of her multi-media spectacle. What she presented
at Spoleto was a digressive series of intriguing songs and scenes
that combine her personal response to the novel with bits of
extraneous whale trivia that may not have been known to Melville.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal, it appears, is to elucidate what is relevant to a
modern audience in ``Moby-Dick.'' It must be for this reason that
Ms. Anderson includes a passage of her own devising that would
probably do Greenpeace proud, a lecture on how sperm whales
communicate and how they got that unusual name. (It dates back, Ms.
Anderson explains, to a misunderstanding over the consistency of
the whale's brain.) Several of Ms. Anderson's conceits are
inspired: a heavy-handed sea chantey from a florid early film
adaptation of the novel is funny. But many of the other musical
interludes merely repeated themselves. Given that Spoleto so
wholeheartedly embraces experiment, it was only fitting that this
should be considered a tryout.

TOKYO OFFERS VAGUE PLAN TO CREATE MORE THAN 700,000 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government Friday announced a plan to
create more than 700,000 jobs but did not say how much it intended
to spend, leaving the plan's potential power to stimulate the
economy somewhat mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which would create the jobs through a package of
measures that includes subsidies to emerging industries such as
biotechnology and telecommunications, was publicly offered one day
after Japan reported the first significant economic growth in two
years. But the first-quarter expansion of 1.9 percent was seen as a
temporary effect of earlier government spending.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes the jobs plan will help strengthen support
for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in advance of parliamentary
elections, which may come as soon as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's unemployment rate, which has steadily risen to a postwar
high of 4.8 percent and could rise further, has combined with
falling wages and bonuses to undermine government efforts to spur
consumer spending with shopping vouchers, tax cuts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's plan is part of an effort to reverse that trend. ``A
continued severe employment situation could cause consumption to be
sluggish,'' Takafusa Shioya, deputy director general of the
Economic Planning Agency, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not attach a cost to the plan. But Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said it would not exceed 500 billion yen,
or about $4.2 billion at current exchange rates. In an economic
stimulus package last November, the government allocated roughly 1
trillion yen to addressing the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the amount mentioned by Miyazawa was too small
to matter. But some said the way the employment plan was structured
was a departure from other job stimulation measures tried by the
Japanese, because it was aimed at stimulating jobs in promising
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that the government's emphasis is
switching from supporting excess labor at existing companies to
more reallocation of labor,'' said Tomoko Fujii, an economist at
Nikko Salomon Smith Barney. ``That should eventually strengthen the
competitiveness of the Japanese economy and lead to better economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The government intends to create almost half of the 700,000-plus
new jobs it promised by itself, in other words, by hiring more
people at the local and central government level. Those jobs, in
areas like computer-related education, health care and
archaeological excavation, are intended to be temporary, but some
economists fear that once the positions are filled, the government
will have trouble eliminating them in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Employers in 15 fledgling industries the government has elected
to foster, including health care, telecommunications and
biotechnology, will receive subsidies for hiring ahead of their
needs, and others will receive public financial support when they
hire middle-aged people who have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The government also pledged to overhaul the unemployment
insurance program, something it has been talking about doing for a
while, and to enhance job retraining programs, which are outdated
and full to overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   And it repeated a variety of promises, ranging from making
spinoffs easier to overhauling the bankruptcy laws, that would make
it easier for corporations to restructure themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the public sector hire more people, loaning more public
money to private business development _ all this smacks of a
quasi-socialist attempt at engineering economic growth,'' said
Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan Ltd. ``In the short
term, if you're worried about boosting competitiveness, you should
be willing to tolerate rising unemployment, like South Korea did
over the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   While the government is skilled in deploying large sums of money
to build bridges and repave roads, handing out money for ``soft''
fiscal stimuli is more complicated. ``I'm pretty sure some of these
items are not going to be implemented because the external
constraints make implementation difficult,'' Ms. Fujii said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in the past, the government set aside money to
address the chronic shortage of day-care centers in Japan's urban
areas. It left implementation of the plan, which envisioned the
proliferation of child-care centers near major commuter
transportation terminals, to the local governments _ but they are
preoccupied with their own financial travails.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, money alone was not enough incentive to overcome the
problem of high rent and labor costs that any entrepreneur
considering opening a day-care center here would have to overcome.

RENAULT EXECUTIVE MOVING TO NISSAN SKETCHES SOME OF HIS IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Carlos Ghosn, the former Renault SA executive who will
soon be helping manage Nissan Motor Co., on Friday gave reporters a
peek at where he hopes to help steer the troubled Japanese
automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn is an important part of the complex, cross-border alliance
that began in March, when Renault bought a 36.8 percent piece of
Nissan in hopes of improving its long-term chances of survival. As
such, Ghosn has spent much of the time since the deal was announced
trying to get to know the company he will officially join later
this month. He is also taking a crash course in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of informal press briefings Friday, he made it clear
that he had not finished his research but had some ideas about
where he will be heading when he becomes chief operating officer of
Japan's second-largest car company. ``Even if it's not complete,
there are a lot of chapters of this diagnosis already written,''
Ghosn said.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Ghosn said, Nissan's suppliers are on notice that
if they hope to work with the company going forward, they must
prove they can provide the best technical innovation, quality and
price.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn also said that the dealership networks that Nissan owns
are less profitable than their independently owned cousins. He
hinted that Nissan should increase the number of independent
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   He even foreshadowed what may become the first friction between
Nissan and its new partner, the potential purchase by Nissan of a
stake in Renault that would mirror Renault's stake in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of such a reciprocal purchase was a significant
part of the agreement between the two companies. It allowed Nissan
to save face and it underscored the notion that the two companies
were equal partners, not knight and vanquished. Nissan president
Yoshikazu Hanawa, soon to be Ghosn's boss, said this week at a
meeting in Paris that he hoped to consummate that part of the deal
as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosn, however, sounded less eager, perhaps because it will be
his job to make sure Nissan pays down a big chunk of the billions
of dollars of debt that drove it to seek a partnership with
Renault. ``I really don't know,'' he said when asked whether Nissan
would purchase shares in Renault. ``The most important thing is
putting Nissan back to profitability, and then we can decide what
to do with the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that that decision should be based on whether the
purchase of Renault's shares would be the best use of the company's
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Any potential conflict on this issue, however, will not happen
soon. Ghosn said Nissan's losses would widen in the fiscal year
that ends March 31, although he said Nissan might recover
profitability in the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it will happen; I'm saying it's possible,'' he
said. ``We'll need a little luck.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian-born executive has spent his time meeting as many
Nissan employees as possible, using interpreters who specialize in
both French and English, as well as a trusted assistant to help him
along. ``Unfortunately, I don't speak Japanese well enough to
conduct a business conversation, but it will come, it will come,''
he said. ``It's part of the cost saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Light-hearted as he may be, Ghosn seems to clearly understand
the challenges he will face in trying to turn around one of Japan's
most conservative and traditional companies. ``What I'd like to do
is probably different from what I'll be doing,'' he said.

   MICCOSUKEES _ For more than 100 years, they lived a rugged,

from the white settlers who pushed them off more hospitable coastal
lands. But this week, the once-isolated Miccosukee Indians enter a
new era with the official June 14 opening of their 302-room luxury
gambling resort perched on the border of the vast swamp. The tribe
has already prospered with a popular bingo operation on the site,
but the new resort will feature video gambling machines and
top-flight entertainers like Hootie and the Blowfish and Bill
Cosby. Environmentalists worry about the tribe's growing
developments in and around the troubled Everglades, but tribe
officials say they have done more to save the swamp than anybody
else. (MWilliams, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

for lack even a broken-down desk. Each year, the girls start their
studies by erasing the penciled-in work in last-year's workbooks so
they can be reused. Serious Samar Khatab, a 13-year-old in fifth

maintained that the northern third of the island was safe,
Montserrat's tourism industry was decimated. Still, 3,000 residents
-- of the original 10,000 -- refused to leave their homeland in the
hopes that their volcano would quiet down. The volcano continues to
steam, but scientists say it has entered a period of repose. So how

Bay, a posh area often referred to as Montserrat's own Beverly

the Kleebs, who say they have all their money tied up in their
retirement home, have refused to leave. They alone have stayed on
in the shadow of the volcano in open defiance of a government order
to leave the so-called danger zone. ``I'm 70 years old and I've

THE HOKEY HIPNESS OF WHEAT GRASS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PENELOPE GREEN  (DW) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I've got a tiny lawn in my house, as goofy and bright
as a Chia Pet and darn near as useful. I couldn't be happier.
Feeling like Mrs. Dalloway on her errand to pick up flowers, I
brought the thing home with me last week _ a fresh June morning on
10th Street _ a 4-by-7-inch box with sprouted wheat grass, wrapped
in pale blue tissue paper from Spruce on Greenwich Avenue. Spruce
is a flower store with a motto _ ``Our grass is greener!'' _ and it
specializes in witty and ironic items like a pickle jar with
daisies floating in three inches of water and boxes of wheat grass
like mine, which sell for $25 each.
</P>
<P>
   The box of grass is a decorating flourish that seems to make an
appearance every 10 years or so, like Donna Summer. I've been
seeing a lot of potted grass sprouting up, so to speak, lately: on
the tables at Palladin, the restaurant at the new boutique hotel
called Time; in the rooms at the W hotel, complete with a
galvanized metal watering can and a little sign saying ``Water
Me!''; in Asian-inspired department stores like Felissimo and
Takashimaya. These sightings amused and tempted me. Take a trend
home! Why not?
</P>
<P>
   This one's as furry as a shag rug, but I can throw it out if it
gets on my nerves. Perhaps you've seen a box of grass yourself.
Perhaps you've wondered, why wheat grass, why now?
</P>
<P>
   Wheat grass is hokey, and therefore modern. ``I like hokey, and
so I like wheat grass,'' said David Stark, a painter, who with his
partner, Avi Adler, another painter, makes extravagant and mod
floral installations for the best parties these days, like the
Brite Nite shindig at the Whitney Museum in March. ``It's all about
context,'' Stark said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat grass is sort of a signature for these guys, who made
wheat grass candelabras for the New York City Opera (``very Emerald
City,'' Stark said), wheat grass walls for a party for the Greg
Norman clothing collection and steps upholstered in wheat grass
leading into the 69th Regiment Armory for the American fashion
awards two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not using it as a little Zen tribute,'' Stark said. ``I'm
more interested in the maximalism of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat grass is interactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excited about the W because it seemed like an
opportunity to make progress in what a hotel looked and felt
like,'' said David Rockwell, the architect of the midtown hotel and
creator of other giddy theme places like Planet Hollywood and the
Mohegan Sun casino in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he continued, ``we wanted to move beyond this
impersonal anonymous thing. So the box of grass was something
alive, something you could interact with, i.e. you could water it,
and maybe feel a little bit rejuvenated. There's a Secret Garden
thing going on, and `Water Me,' of course, is sort of Alice in
Wonderland. There are nurturing implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat grass is ironic.
</P>
<P>
   A lawn in a box makes a nice reference to the suburbs or an
idealized childhood, and so is the perfect coffee table fixture for
urban adults. You can display it alongside a new book, ``A Man's
Turf: The Perfect Lawn'' (Clarkson Potter) by Warren Schulz, out
last month. Here's Schulz, a turf specialist, writing about the
sweet smell of mown grass: ``It's the scent of growth, interrupted
by sharp circumstance.''
</P>
<P>
   But wheat grass isn't really grass, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, it's just sprouted wheat. It gets leggy and weird and
yellow in about two weeks. ``People think it's like a house plant,
but it's not, it's more like cut flowers,'' said Ken Druse, author
of ``The Collector's Garden'' (Clarkson Potter, 1996). ``You have
to throw it out.''
</P>
<P>
   So who started the trend?
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, me?'' Druse suggested. ``I know I put it in a shoot for GQ
in 1979, on a table with some sand. It always amuses me when it
comes around again.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother said: ``The Swedish Ambassador's wife? It was in
Washington, in the early 70s, and she gave a party for some tennis
player, and there were grass centerpieces, with a little net strung
over each one. I was very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   What Swedish ambassador's wife, Mom? ``I don't know. Maybe I
didn't go to the dinner party. Maybe I just heard about it. Ask
Renny.''
</P>
<P>
   Renny Reynolds of New York, who has been making parties fabulous
with his flowers since 1972, said: ``Maybe it was Tony Di Pace. He
was Halston's companion, a brilliant grower, and he was all about
overkill in a pot, like masses of narcissus. Ask Ronaldo.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo is Ronaldo Maia, a Madison Avenue florist, who says he
personally has planted wheat grass in boxes with living flowers for
25 years, but he wasn't the first. ``Oh, it would be nice if it
were Tony,'' he said. ``He was a gorgeous person. No longer with
us. A fantastic artist who brought beautiful things to the city.
Mountains of moss, pots of moss! Maybe grass flats. People would
say, `What is this mud on my table?' Life then, it was all
Champagne. Now, it's just Alka-Seltzer.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought the box of grass was a Zona creation, introduced in
those throbbing yuppie years in the mid- to late 80s, when the
lines to get into Zona at Christmas stretched down Greene Street.
Do you remember Zona, one of the first ``life style'' stores, with
its Windham Hill soundtrack and its preciously displayed objects _
Soleri bells and Smith &AMP; Hawken gardening tools and Taos furniture
_ each presented with a tiny printed index card? I can imagine the
little printed card that would have accompanied the wheat grass:
``Remember grass? This is the real thing. Run your fingers through
it. Wiggle your toes in it. Or leave it around the house as a
textural accent.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Sagar, Zona's founder, told me: ``I don't remember what we
wrote, but I was one of the first to show it as something you could
do indoors. It had a few inspirations, like always wishing to have
the grass of suburbia, even though we know it's a trap, and also
the experience of seeing something natural grow and change is a
wonderful thing to bring into the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat grass is still soulful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole first floor is called Dream Ground,'' said Mitria
Digiacomo, vice president of corporate marketing and creative
services at Felissimo, the Asian-themed housewares store on West
56th Street. ``It's a place where you come and contemplate and are
inspired. I wanted grass for that. It's this very natural thing
that's not designed and goes back to our philosophy here of being
an urban oasis.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat grass isn't a look, it's a life style.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its role as table-top lawn, wheat grass is a 70s-era
cure-all _ for cancer, bad breath, gray hair, blood poisoning,
dirty aquariums and more. One-ounce shots of wheat grass juice _
still turning stomachs after all these years _ are sold at most
health food stores and juice bars. I tossed one back recently, at
Karen's on Astor Place. It was acid green and frothy and utterly
disgusting. The juicer man cheered, ``Knock it back, baby, knock it
back!'' and then handed me a chaser of water.

ANCIENT MESOAMERICAN SCULPTURES MAY BE EARLIEST RENDERINGS OF HUMAN
FETUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico, Central America, Ill., Pa., Texas)   (bl)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was it Roe vs. Wade, circa 900 B.C? The breaking of an ancient
taboo or an expression of spiritual transformation? Or some other
yet-to-be-explained convergence of art, science and religion?
</P>
<P>
   In any case, two scholars writing in a bio-medical journal say
they have identified the earliest known naturalistic renderings of
the human fetus, carved by various stone sculptors in Mexico more
than 2,000 years before Leonardo da Vinci made the first anatomical
drawing of the unborn child in the early 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures, from the ancient Olmec civilization, have long
been classified by museums and collectors as dwarfs, dancers,
acrobats and jesters. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
which displays one of the sculptures cited in the article _ a
10{-inch-high stone statuette with bent knees and hands at the ears
of its large helmeted head _ calls it a ``crouching figure.''
</P>
<P>
   But the authors, citing supporting evidence from obstetricians,
neonatologists and other medical specialists, say the effigies with
their distinctive oversize heads and sharply bent knees portray
fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they would be extraordinarily rare in the history of art.
Most societies until Leonardo's time shunned depictions of the
unborn, say the article's authors, art historian Carolyn Tate and
cardiologist Gordon Bendersky. They suggest that humans regard
gestating life as ``too sacred for scrutiny'' and may be
uncomfortable contemplating its strange changes in form.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures studied, 21 figures carved between 900 and 600
B.C., are described as individualized portraits showing such finely
rendered prenatal details as incompletely formed ears, swellings
and folds around the eyes, the bony protrusion of the clavicle and
even the translucence of the skin as portrayed by the choice of
stone incised with lines reddened with cinnabar to simulate veins.
They are, moreover, in dynamic poses as they might be in the womb,
arms crossed, or hands to head, or in one case, one hand cocked at
the ear ``as if intently listening.''
</P>
<P>
   The article was published this week in the spring issue of
Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, a quarterly journal of the
Division of Biological Sciences of the University of Chicago.
Editors said it would be posted shortly on the University of
Chicago Press' Web site (www.journals.uchicago. edu).
</P>
<P>
   Bendersky, a cardiologoist at MCP-Hahnemann University School of
Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and a visiting art
scholar, is an avid art sleuth who has proposed medical solutions
to other art mysteries. In 1977 he identified a 3,000-year-old
Olmec vessel as the earliest known anatomically correct image of
the human heart.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tate, a Mesoamerican specialist at Texas Tech University in
Lubbock, is the author of the book ``Yaxchilan: The Design of a
Maya Ceremonial City'' (University of Texas Press, 1992).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tate first thought that the figures' poses suggested
epileptic seizures and asked Bendersky for an opinion. She also
broached the fetus theory and, after initial skepticism, he
obtained medical opinions that supported her growing conviction
that the sculptures were fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Since the article has just been published, most experts in the
field have not yet read the findings. But Brian Stross, a professor
of anthropology at the University of Texas in Austin, who reviewed
the article before it appeared, said, ``I find it quite credible.''
He said that because of the lack of written records, ``there isn't
going to be any better evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Terence Grieder, another University of Texas specialist in
pre-Colombian art and archaeology who also reviewed the findings,
said: ``I don't know a lot about fetuses but I know about art.'' He
said he had studied the same sculptures himself, had known Ms. Tate
as a graduate student and trusted her conclusions. ``I think she's
right on the button,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Olmecs appeared along the Gulf Coast of what is now Mexico,
Guatemala and Belize about 1200 B.C. and vanished about 400 B.C.,
leaving behind monumental helmeted stone heads with flat eyes and
noses and thickly carved, downturned lips, and glyphs hinting of a
written language.
</P>
<P>
   In their article, Bendersky and Ms. Tate say that some of the
small figures show congenital deformities, including an undersize
jaw or lack of a jaw altogether, conditions called micronathia and
agnathia, or a disproportionate enlargement of the head,
macrocephaly, which may have led to premature birth and death.
While deliberate abortions were performed in Mesoamerica, as in
many other ancient societies worldwide, the Olmec fetuses were most
likely spontaneously aborted, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The feet of the sculptures are uncommonly large, but for
practical reasons of stability rather than symbolic ones, the
authors say.
</P>
<P>
   The Olmecs did produce some images of dwarfs, they write, but
they do not show the same distinctive 1-to-3 or 1-to-4 head-to-body
ratio of the figures identified as fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations at an early Olmec site at El Manati, Veracruz,
Mexico, they say, uncovered the skulls of several newborns or
fetuses, some bearing evidence of cuts suggesting they might have
been sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Why the veneration of the fetuses? Bendersky and Ms. Tate say
the Olmecs may have known enough about the progression of reptile
forms that a human fetus passes through to relate the process to
the mystical transformation of their shaman, or spiritual leader,
into jaguar and other animal incarnations. In a similar vein, the
authors say, Mesoamerican people related human beings to the maize
plant with its growing cycles and some of the fetus sculptures bear
maize iconography.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tate credited the Olmecs with scientific courage in focusing
on the fetus, probably observed from stillbirths. ``Instead of
saying, `Oooo, this is yucky' and throwing it away,'' she said,
``they studied it.''

A FEW TIPS FOR NEWCOMERS TO FLORIDA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Newcomers to an area don't always know what they're getting
into, which is why I think the ``Code of the West'' booklet
published by rural Spokane County, Wash., is an especially good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet gives city folk transplanted from California and
other pickup-truck-deprived areas some pointers on living in
Spokane and deals with issues that seldom come up in La-la Land.
</P>
<P>
   For those who might not be aware, the booklet explains that
``unpaved roads generate dust'' and that ``animals and their manure
can cause objectionable odors.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks who have never lived in anything but an apartment or
condominium might also be grateful for this useful tip on lawn
maintenance: ``Without irrigation, grass does not grow very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of people who relocate to Florida every year would
certainly benefit from a similar tip sheet tailored to our area.
Life in Florida takes some getting used to and not everyone is up
to the challenge. Indeed, some people are so traumatized by their
first few weeks in Florida that they become mentally unbalanced and
spend the remainder of their days swatting at invisible bugs and
organizing architectural review committees.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of invisible bugs, newcomers need to be warned
immediately about Florida's abundant insect life. The way things
are now, people don't learn what a palmetto bug is until one gets
them in a sleeper hold, and then it's too late. It might help calm
new residents if we told them that a palmetto bug is the unofficial
state bird rather than a filthy, disgusting insect that resembles a
penny loafer with wings. We should also advise new residents that
the palmetto bug, being the unofficial state bird, is protected by
law and is not to be shot, stabbed or attacked with a
flame-thrower. It doesn't do any good and just makes them mad.
</P>
<P>
   Like newcomers, palmetto bugs are part of the food chain and are
gleefully consumed by Florida's abundant lizards, iguanas, giant
toads, poisonous snakes, killer bees, stinging ants and surly,
disaffected manatees. (Most of these species find newcomers
distasteful and spit them out after a brief but purposeful gumming.
I would not, after all, want this booklet to seem alarmist.)
</P>
<P>
   When a newcomer encounters any creature with which he is not
familiar (that would be most of them), he should avoid making eye
contact or any threatening gestures. Sometimes a wan smile and a
feeble shrug of the shoulders will defuse the situation, but take
care at all times to avoid presenting any part of your body that
you do not wish to be pierced, probed or lacerated by cruel fangs
or bloodsucking mandibles.
</P>
<P>
   While you're outside enjoying Florida's abundant insect life,
you may notice your flesh melting or your hair spontaneously
bursting into flames. This is because Florida is located in the
``semi-tropics,'' meaning that we're like the tropics, only with
more trucks. But don't despair: The hot weather in Florida lasts
only part of the year, usually from early December to late
November. During the rest of the year the tourists are here and you
won't be able to move.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of not moving, you will probably need time to adjust to
Florida's system of roads and highways. Unlike other parts of the
country, Florida's roads were not built for the purpose of
transporting traffic from one point to another. Rather, their
purpose is to provide work for Florida's dedicated
road-construction crews, some of whom have been tearing up and
replacing the same stretch of pavement continuously for more than
50 years.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the topics that we could cover for
newcomers in our Florida orientation booklet. I have intentionally
omitted any mention of hurricanes, sinkholes, red tide, alligators
or real-estate developers for fear of scaring everyone off to
Spokane County, which I understand doesn't smell all that good.

IT'S ACK-ACK TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Famous brand name. Fawning press coverage. Huge polling lead.
Lots of heavy hitters in the party signed up early and hope to ride
him right into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has it all. Just like Teddy Kennedy 20 years ago
getting ready to fight for the second presidency of his family.
Being a scion is great work if you can get it, till the ack-ack
starts to fly.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy took on an incumbent president of his own party, and was
eventually scuppered by a couple of gents, one he knew, and the
other he'd barely heard of. While Jimmy Carter's tough guys were
roughing Kennedy up in the south and west, and the media powers
phobic about Kennedy-ism were doing their Chappaquiddick number,
Teddy ran into Roger Mudd and the Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   The latter embraced Sen. Theodore as the American preferable to
the Great Satan, the originial Blue-eyed Devil, the aforesaid Mr.
Carter of the Plains, Ga. Baptist Church Sunday School Carters. And
Mudd had the nerve to ask Teddy why he wanted to be president.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayatollah's embrace, and the newsman's impertinence,
combined with the massive weight of the White House political
machinery, put paid to the last Kennedy-for-president drive we can
expect to see. Now it's the turn of the Bush dynasty to see what it
can deliver for ``George Dubayah,'' as the Texas governor trundles
into New Hampshire on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s potential as savior of the GOP has been officially
endorsed by 117 House members and ten GOP senators _ not to mention
a thundering herd of press-carded bus-riding laptop-toting
cell-phone chomping reporters, a lemming-like
journalistic-jackal-pack that will turn on the frontrunner at the
earliest opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't easy being a rich man's son; you think everyone's your
friend, till something goes wrong, and then you learn just how many
people dislike you, not for who you are, but what you are. George
W. is still a rookie in national politics. He had one
medium-to-tough fight for governor in Texas, and a walkover second
election. He's been governor in an era when it was a cinch to be
governor, with good economic times.
</P>
<P>
   His father was rejected by New Hampshire because times were
tough; the son returns to the Granite State for the first time
since his father was running there seven years ago, and the
unemployment rate is 2.4 percent, real estate values are rocketing
upward, and the economy has never been better.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush Limo is easing out of the garage onto the highway that
begins in Iowa and aims straight for New Hampshire. But bad things
can happen to those shiny new bandwagons when they get to rolling.
They can scratched, dented, derailed, ditch-bound, and sometimes
they even get wrecked. Ask Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   There are ten other Republicans eager to stick a pin into George
W.'s balloon as soon as they can manuever themselves within
stabbing distance. I ran against his daddy, ``King George,'' and
I'll run against his son, ``the Prince of Wales,'' jibes
sharpshooter Patrick Buchanan, the Beltway Basher.
</P>
<P>
   George W. will have his hands full with the ten arrayed against
him. But if he reacts too sharply to the brickbats, if he becomes
the Prince of Wails, then all bets are off. The media wisenheimers
are an unforgiving bunch when a frontrunner stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a seismic change in the media corps since the
last presidential election. Impeachment became a Monica-monologue
for much of the media. That's the rationale given for the plunge in
audience share for the major network nightly news shows _ we used
to call them ``programs,'' but now it's ``shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the newspapers as well as our broadcast brethern have
given ground more or less steadily from the traditional role of
delivering basic information, and turned instead to the
higher-octane fuel of delivering opinion, propaganda, or ``spin,''
that process which if left uninterrupted leaves both the donor and
the donee dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the people who are known as ``consumers'' of news,
``customers'' of advertisers, and ``voters'' of democracy have less
faith in the news media, the politicians, and the whole process of
selecting presidents. Cynicism and apathy run hand-in-hand, the
harnessed horsmen of mass-produced despair.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bush gets a reasonable opening to hawk his brand of
``compassionate conservativism'' depends almost wholly upon his
ability to avoid embarassing gaffes in his early weeks on the
campaign. Bush only this week came out for impeachment of Clinton.
That's a six-months lag time on the biggest issue of last winter.
</P>
<P>
   On the war in Kosovo, Bush was initially tentative, tremulous,
and evasive. For or against the NATO air war, Guv? he was asked in
March. ``My question is, `Is it good for America?' And that'll be
the question I'll ask should I end up being the president.''
Twaddle like that will get him nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But he's got to know he can't get away with those fuzzy
throwaway lines now. He's under a great deal of pressure to improve
his learning curve. Being governor of a secure and prosperous
state, with a solicitous press corps, and a docile, not to say
servile, business community, has given Bush an easy ride as
governor. But he's not playing patty-cake in Austin any more.
</P>
<P>
   He stares into his shaving mirror this week and has to be
thinking to himself along these lines: ``I am 52, I've been in only
two elections my whole life, there's a ton of issues about which I
honestly have no clue, and everyone's waiting to see if I fall on
my keister. Lord, just help me through this day.''
</P>
<P>
   He's already stumbled into Tax Cut Swamp, vowing by letter to
veto, as president, any kind of tax increase on personal income or
business income. Why in the world he would reinforce everyone's
memories of his father's infamous ``Read my lips'' vow, the biggest
broken promise of the previous regime, is beyond me. Did he need to
do that for any sensible reason? Nope. But that's the kind of
things rookie candidates do.
</P>
<P>
   If he has half Clinton's ability to wriggle off hooks, survive
ambushes, inch back off sawed-off tree-limbs or otherwise talk his
way out of hot water, Bush could be unbeatable. Selling something
labelled ``compassionate conservatism'' should not be any more
difficult than successfully peddling ``lukewarm liberalism,'' which
was Clinton's 1992 mealticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's personal mettle, his character, his family, his father's
record, his ``vision thing,'' his business record, his ability to
roll with the punches on the stump, and his ability to prevail over
fatigue and confusion and conflicting advice will all be tested by
the most arduous ordeal in American politics, a front-running
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have changed post-Clinton. And not for the better.
There will be days when it will not be pretty. But Bush has to
undergo those trials in order to get from here to there.

</P>
<P>
   EAST-WEST-VALUES-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Americans think their values
are the world's _ and in economics, that often is true. But to some
nations, the Kosovo atrocities were just the broken eggs of yet
another national omelet and the West is a self-righteous, ever-more
meddlesome cook. This anti-West club is not so much motivated by
love for Milosevic as a conviction that bloodlettings like Kosovo
are internal matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust
yourself into someone else's war; that the safe and even humane
course usually is to let the two sides duke it out. By Michael
Wines. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   LOWERCLASS-PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S. economic boom
is finally starting to trickle down to affect the poorest
Americans, challenging the conventional wisdom that government had
a crucial role in helping the poor. But now there's reason to
wonder if maybe prosperity can do the job alone. Or to put it
another way, how far down the economic ladder can prosperity be
expected to reach? Economists aren't sure, but job statistics give
some interesting clues. By Michael Weinstein. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-SWITCH-REVIEW (Washington) _ With more drugs available and
more prescriptions being written each year, the FDA is concerned
about deaths and injuries caused by medications. Much attention is
given to medication mix-ups and other pharmaceutical errors. But
many people don't realize that pharmacists, at the behest of
insurance companies and HMOs, intentionally switch medications all
the time, with potentially harmful consequences. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDRAISING-LOSERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Whether they are
well-known faces or ordinary people who run for Congress, losing
candidates find that just because the election is over doesn't mean
the fund-raising stops. But if it was tough raising money in the
heat of a campaign, try fund-raising after Election Day, as the
bills from pollsters, the telephone company and poster makers keep
rolling in. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   JUDAISM-PROSELYTIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike Christianity,
Judaism emphatically shuns prosyletizing. But even if many
modern-day rabbis are not so discouraging as all that, what would
happen if they took a really different tack and encouraged
spiritual seekers to embrace Judaism? That idea is gaining
attention _ and some hot criticism. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-APPOINT-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's recess
appointment of a homosexual as ambassador to Luxembourg has
provoked a clash between two of the most venerable _ and arguably
most anachronistic _ traditions of the federal government. At issue
is the right of the president to make appointments during
congressional recesses without Senate confirmation vs. the right of
individual senators to block any nomination that comes before them.
By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-TITUS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Movie audiences will
see a different side of Shakespeare in the upcoming film version of
`Titus Andronicus.' It is Shakespeare's bloodiest play and, many
critics feel, his worst. Some examples of critical reaction over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   WILDE-HUSBAND-REVIEW (Undated) _ A century after the debut of
Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' the portrait of a successful
politician trying to slip out of humiliation retains a certain
currency, while the portrait of his wife seems like a classy
photograph that has faded from fashion. By Waklter Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-MONITORS-REVIEW (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ One of the
founders of the National Movement for Free Elections, or Namfrel,
Jose Concepcion helped end the 20-year rule of Fredinand Marcos and
pioneer a new weapon in the spread of democracy around the world:
independent, citizen-led election-watch groups. He was in Jakarta
last week with a Namfrel delegation keeping an eye on the world's
latest democratic experiment, Indonesia's first free election in 44
years. Also here were scores of men and women from other nations
who are in effect his students. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-COMPUTERS-REVIEW (Washington) The U.S. has determined that
the new Sony Playstation II, available later this year, is powered
by a chip so powerful that Washington would have to be notified
before it could be shipped to China. But a Chinese military officer
determined to play out his fantasies on state-of-the-art Sony _
perhaps simulate an attack on Taiwan _ can simply send his kids to
any of the five Toys `R' Us stores in Hong Kong, which is still
considered a safe place to send advanced technology even though it
has reverted to Chinese rule. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TEACH-REVIEW (Belgrade) _ Serbia's leaders have cast the
Kosovo air war as great patriotic trial even as the West has cast
it as a great moral crusade, and so it is reasonable to wonder just
what the next generation of Serbs will be taught about the war,
particularly since the nationalist government remains in power. By

 &HT;    Cinnabon Bakeries expanding overseas
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cinnabon Bakeries is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based cinnamon roll retailer Friday announced
several major international and domestic deals that will
significantly broaden its market.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the company has signed agreements for 134 new units in
Asia, the Middle East and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabon, which is owned by Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises, will
make its entry into the Asian market in a franchise deal to open 42
bakeries in Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   William Van Epps, president of AFC's international division,
called the Asian deal the first of many. He said more deals could
be announced over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia, even with the recent economic problems, is starting to
turn around and a lot of companies are looking now at expansion for
the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cinnabon also has reached a franchise agreement with Mohammed
Qusai Assad &AMP; Sons for an 42 units in the Middle East, which
includes 25 units in Egypt, 12 in Kuwait and five in Jordan. The
bakeries will be opened during a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the United States, Cinnabon and Host Marriott Services
extended their current partnership with plans to open 50 sites over
the next eight years. The partnership has units in various airports
and travel plazas, which contain gas stations and food courts.
</P>
<P>
   Franchising is a major growth vehicle for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Under its previous owners, Cinnabon had suspended its
franchising efforts, but they were revived when it was acquired by
AFC last October.
</P>
<P>
   Van Epps said the international markets have a lot of potential
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international arena will probably double or triple that of
the domestic market in the foreseeable future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Cinnabon has 16 bakeries outside the United States.
Those are located in Canada, Saudi Arabia and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, over the years they have had a good reputation and
apparently with the right controls in place, AFC felt this was the
proper time to step up their expansion,'' said Bill Carlino,
managing editor of Nation's Restaurant News, a New York-based trade
publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``To expand you obviously need capital and AFC certainly has
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlino said it's hard for U.S. food concepts to go wrong
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the international consumer has always had a kind
of fascination with American concepts,'' he said. ``There have been
a lot of companies that have had good success in overseas
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinnabon has 375 bakeries in 39 states. Systemwide sales in 1998
were $140 million.
</P>
<P>
   AFC also owns Churchs Chicken, Popeyes Chicken &AMP; Biscuits,
Seattle's Best Coffee, Torrefazione Italia Coffee and Chesapeake
Bagel Bakery.

 &HT;    Coca-Cola acquires Asian bottling operations
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. said it will acquire the Asian bottling
operations of Fraser and Neave Ltd. of Singapore in a $271 million
equity deal.
</P>
<P>
   The move is unusual for the Atlanta-based beverage company,
which seldom acquires a controlling stake in bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola said Friday that buying the F&AMP;N Coca-Cola Pte Ltd
subsidiary reflects its belief that emerging markets in the region
offer an opportunity to put its drinks in the hands of 260 million
more consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola currently owns 25 percent of F&AMP;N Coca-Cola, which has
bottling operations in Brunei, Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, Singapore and Vietnam. The company also has operations in
Malaysia, but those are not part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of Coca-Cola's business in Asia has slowed over the
last year because of economic problems that have made consumers
less eager, and able, to buy its products. For the first quarter of
1999, Coca-Cola estimated its unit case volume, a way of measuring
beverage consumption, dropped 1 to 2 percent, compared with an
increase of 11 percent in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser and Neave, which has interests in dairy products,
breweries and commercial real estate, also has lost money trying to
quench thirsts in the region. The company reported Friday that it
lost $48 million in Singapore dollars ($28 million in U.S.) in the
six months ended March 31 on its beverage operations. Soft drink
sales were down in Indochina, Singapore, Malaysia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulty in growing the business, Coca-Cola has
said that owning a majority stake in a bottler allows it to better
control sales and marketing programs, and strengthen business and
information systems. It also allows the company to put capital
where it's needed to build a bottler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence in the long-term growth prospects in this
region of the world is strong,'' said Douglas N. Daft, president of
the company's Middle and Far East Group. ``We are fully committed
to having the right capital and management structure in place to
capture profitable growth over the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Caroline Levy at Schroder &AMP; Co. told Bloomberg News that
Coca-Cola is getting the F&AMP;N bottling operations at ``a very good
price.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its controlling stake in F&AMP;N Coca-Cola, Fraser
and Neave will gain the Atlanta company's 5.6 percent stake in the
Australian anchor bottler Coca-Cola Amatil. As an anchor, Amatil is
one of Coke system's largest bottlers, and the stake is valued at
$271 million. After the deal, Coca-Cola's stake in Amatil will drop
to 37 percent, from 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction comes on the heels of a failed attempt by
Coca-Cola to salvage a deal with Cadbury-Schweppes to acquire that
London-based beverage maker's operations in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite revising their original agreement, Coca-Cola failed to
convince Australian antitrust regulators that it would not end up
having too much control of the local soft drink market.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the revision called for Amatil to handle the production,
sale and distribution of Cadbury's products, but Amatil would sell
some of its second-tier products to Cadbury.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Coca-Cola's stock lost 2 percent of its value
Friday, closing at $64.44, down $1.50.

 &HT;    TECHNOBUDDY: Remember MP3 _ it's a pioneer
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year or so before Apple introduced its palm-sized Newton you
were told that almost everyone would want to own one of those
little gadgets that let you write on the screen instead of type on
a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to make a person go out and buy stock in Apple.
Those who did were soon sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton is literally history. It had a few flaws: Most
notable was the fact that its handwriting recognition technology
didn't work any more often than your laziest uncle.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when it seems I work in the hysteria industry
covering a world that changes too fast to follow. When an arguably
important technology comes along, the press is tempted to scream
loud and fast rather than take the chance of missing something.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that we were wrong about the Newton, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   It truly did make history. It was a pioneer, the first breeze
that told us a storm was coming. The news wasn't that Newton was
the product of the century. Instead it was tangible proof that
smart people at a big technology company were trying to satisfy the
public desire for computing on the go.
</P>
<P>
   The itch was a real one and you won't have to look hard today to
find the successor to the Newton. Sooner or later, a company really
did make palm-sized computing practical and nowadays the Palm Pilot
scatches that itch nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Smart people at big companies are making the same sort of bets
on a technology called MP3 right now. MP3 is being touted as a
technology that will replace CDs as the way you buy music. Instead
of dropping in at the music store, you'll download your music from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it, or against it. Instead, learn from the history
of technology. You'll find dozens of pioneering products that were
important as predictors of a basic change. In many cases, the
products fell by the wayside ... that's always been the risk that
pioneers take.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that you don't know Mosiac from monosodium glutamate.
It was one of the earliest computer programs used to browse the
Internet's World Wide Web, introduced back in the days before most
of you knew or cared what the Web was.
</P>
<P>
   It got rave reviews and _ unlike the Newton _ it actually
worked. But nowadays Microsoft and Netscape own the market for
browsers. Mosiac's place was as a pioneer. Just as the Conastoga
wagons paved the way for Interstate highways to the West, Mosiac
made it possible for you to show off your kids on your own personal
Web page. It wasn't the wagon that ended up being a big deal, the
important thing was in opening up a way to move West.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes we forget that when working in the hysteria
industry. When a Newton or a Mosiac comes along, the temptation _
both in the public and in the press _ is to focus on the product
itself and not on the need that it was created to fill. Important
products _ and Newton and Mosiac fit that definition _ are created
to solve a problem.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about MP3 _ a technology with a name so unwieldly
that we must call it by its initials instead of Motion Picture
Coding Experts Group-1, audio layer-3 _ it would be a mistake to
focus on today's technology or even on MP3.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 may end up being the best thing since sliced bread. But, it
is not that yet. Try this experiment, even now after it has been
written about extensively. Stand in the mall and ask the next 10
people what MP3 is. My guess is that two of them will think it's a
new Army tank and at least one person thinks you're trying to get
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Then take another survey, this time among your friends who have
a computer and access to the Internet. Ask them if they regularly
download files _ and that's what you must do if people are to make
money peddling music on the Net using MP3.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 may some day represent a technology as simple and as
all-pervasive as the telephone. But _ other than to the companies
that are betting big bucks on it _ that's almost immaterial.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is that the wind is blowing again. Now that
we've sampled how easy it is to order merchandise using the
Internet, there is a growing desire to be pampered even more. We
want the Net to deliver that merchandise ... in this case music.
And, by MP3 or some technology that you've never heard of, it will
happen.

 &HT;    System administrators battle Explorer worm
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday morning, an e-mail landed in Brent Fowler's
in-box at Socket Public Relations in suburban Tucker, Ga. The
e-mail was from one of Socket's clients, a technology firm in
Raleigh. Normal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler clicked to open the note, then clicked to open the
attached document files.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the attached file, which contained a software
infection called a worm, entered Fowler's address book and sent
copies of itself to everyone in it. It might also have erased the
files on his hard drive. The same scenario played out on the PC of
every recipient of Fowler's e-mail: co-workers, clients, friends,
family.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, the 30-PC system at Socket was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday they were back up and running. But Peter Baron, Socket
principal, estimates the lost time and data will cost his firm
about $10,000; $5,000 per click.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slammed us pretty good,'' Baron said. ``This is the most
wicked one I've seen. And I think it's going to get worse now that
they've figured out the social aspect to make it seem like it came
from friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Worm.Explore.Zip bug, the third major computer infection in
three months, hit sometime this week but landed in e-mail in-boxes
in full force Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was socially engineered in a sense, designed to
address itself to its recipients in a friendly fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi (recipient name)'' the initial message reads, ``I received
your e-mail and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a
look at the attached zipped docs.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is harmless unless a person opens the ``zipped
docs,'' a term referring to a compressed file sent with the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   By opening that file, a person unknowingly activates the bug.
</P>
<P>
   The virus attacked computers at Compaq Computer, Motorola, AT&AMP;T,
Boeing, General Electric and Southern Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The messages contain an attached file that, when opened,
releases a software program that can destroy any files created by
Microsoft programs, including spreadsheets, documents and
presentations. The bug is only known to hit PCs running Microsoft
operating systems, including Windows 95 and Windows 98 and Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses this year, computer
systems administrators were able to react more quickly to the worm,
possibly reducing the extent of the damage, said IBM's Dave Chess.
</P>
<P>
   He said for the short-term, computer owners should avoid opening
any e-mail that bears an attachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a file attached to an e-mail, don't open it, even
if it appears to be from someone you know,'' said Chess, a member
of IBM's anti-virus research team in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get one, call the person who sent it and ask if they
meant to. If they did, you're probably OK,'' he said. ``That's
probably the hardest thing to understand. It's tough to realize how
insidious e-mail can be. ``

 &HT;    AS REFUGEES GROW ANXIOUS TO RETURN, PERILS OF KOSOVO STILL CLEAR
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN-0612.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORINI, Albania _ Beyond the turquoise waters of the White Drin
River and over a grassy ridge that obscured their source, two
plumes of white smoke towered above the Kosovo side of this border
crossing Friday and served as a warning that the province is still
not safe.
</P>
<P>
   For the third day in a row since the signing of the peace deal
requiring withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, no refugees
crossed into Albania from the province.
</P>
<P>
   But none had tried to return, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one dares to go in there until the Serb military and police
withdraw,'' said an Albanian policeman, giving his name only as
Teki, as he lounged with a machine-gun on a hill near the border.
He speculated that the smoke was from Serbs burning homes, as they
have done throughout Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the nearly half a million ethnic Albanian refugees in
Albania waited to learn when they can go home, reasons seemed to
multiply for why returning might be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups spoke of the land mines, booby traps and unexploded
ordnance suspected on the other side. United Nations workers
worried that there could be an uncontrollable crush of refugees if
they begin coming from camps far away in central and southern
Albania. And, officials with the pro-independence Kosovo Liberation
Army warned of Serb forces just inside Kosovo who have yet to begin
withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   They are not required to leave the area near Albania for another
few days and the KLA claimed that the Serbs were still engaged in
the kind of activity that drove nearly 800,000 ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have observed a few units withdrawing but not the big ones.
On their way withdrawing, they have been looting and burning
houses,'' said KLA representative Kadri Kryeziu (cq).
</P>
<P>
   The KLA says its forces are frozen in position and will not try
to pursue the Serbs during their withdrawal. But, the group's
leaders say their fighters will attack if they see Serbs looting
homes.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs Friday of the shaky security situation in
Kosovo. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
reported that two northern Albanian towns, Pogaj and Qafa Prushit,
came under light shelling from Serb troops Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees, eager to go back to their land if only to find the
charred rubble of their homes, seemed to understand the risks of
return but not the time it will take for peacekeeping forces to
secure Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vjollcas Nebiu(cq), a 17-year-old refugee living in the back of
a flat-bed truck with 15 relatives, said she is worried about land
mines but, ``just a week would be enough for NATO to go in and then
tell us that it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say it will take months, likely into next summer,
until all the refugees can return. About half the homes in Kosovo
are estimated to be damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about security in Kosovo will start being answered as
early as Saturday, when the first NATO troops may enter southern
Kosovo from Macedonia. On Sunday or Monday, more than 2,000 German
troops will lead a convoy that includes aid workers and journalists
into southwestern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Seven mine removal teams are being imported from abroad and the
United Nations is expected to send several hundred aid workers into
the province in the beginning of next week.

THE HANDS-ON LEADER WHO WILL HEAD THE MERGER OF HONEYWELL AND
ALLIED SIGNAL

 (For release, Sunday, June 17)  (DW) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has not been a restful week for Michael R. Bonsignore. Since
Monday, when Honeywell Inc., the $8.4 billion company he has headed
since 1993, and Allied Signal told the world they planned to merge,
it has been helicopters, airplanes, limousines, one after the
other, shuttling him between Honeywell's Minneapolis headquarters
and Allied's home in Morristown, N.J., with investor meetings in
New York, Boston, Washington and Philadelphia in between.
</P>
<P>
   Then reporters across the country wanted a look-see and chat
with the man, relatively obscure until now, who will run the $25
billion corporate behemoth that the merger would form.
</P>
<P>
   Many chief executives might see the glare as a price to pay for
getting such a mighty job. But Bonsignore, a handsome six-footer
who at age 58 looks the part of a movieland chief executive, sees
the attention as a bonus that he has earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe one day I'll have my grandchild make a scrapbook of all
the stuff,'' he said. ``I worked hard to develop credibility at
Honeywell, and being in the spotlight feels like the next logical
step, and one that I'm enjoying very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mike Bonsignore _ and yes, he insists that everyone
call him Mike _ took his obscurity personally. He was annoyed that
a company he defines as a maker of high-tech controls is best known
as a humdrum maker of thermostats.
</P>
<P>
   His 12 years in Minneapolis have been extraordinarily settled
for one whose bags are usually packed, and will be again for the
move to Morristown, the merged company's headquarters. His father,
a physician, practiced all over the world when Bonsignore was a
child. Having lived in 12 states and 6 countries, Bonsignore, who
speaks three foreign languages, is as comfortable sending the
Honeywell board to Russia to attend the Bolshoi Ballet with the
minister of culture as he is boating with local friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only person I know who doesn't get jet-lagged,'' said
E.D. Grayson, Honeywell's general council and a frequent _ and
often exhausted _ travel companion of Bonsignore.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore met his wife, Sheila, the child of another nomadic
American family, when they were teen-agers in Venezuela. Both take
moving in their stride; the East Coast is farther from their two
grown children in California, but near Michael, the son and
professional actor who is currently appearing in ``Angels Fall,''
Off Broadway. ``We're gypsies by nature, and Sheila is
head-over-heels crazy about New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York _ or, specifically, Wall Street _ has been pretty crazy
about Honeywell of late. Its stock had hit $95 even before word of
the impending merger sent it on a weeklong rise that had it closing
at $113 &UR;  &LR; on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mike Bonsignore, who joined Honeywell in 1969, became
its chief in 1993, Honeywell's sales were mired at $6 billion and
its stock price sat in the $20's.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, and thus, by
his own description, is a trained leader. He introduced
benchmarking, performance-based pay and a
sell-solutions-not-widgets marketing approach. He insisted that
managers set high goals; those that met them were rewarded, those
that did not were out. He got Honeywell managers and engineers
talking to one another, and to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes you immediately is his openness and candor and
how easy he makes it for people to disagree with him,'' Grayson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lawrence A. Bossidy, the chief executive of Allied, and
John F. Welch Jr., GE's chief and Bossidy's former boss, Bonsignore
was brought up a strict Catholic. ``You can't say we have a
Catholic chemistry, but we're products of that upbringing, strict
men of our word,'' said Bonsignore, who went to parochial school
and still spends many Sundays at church.
</P>
<P>
   At Bonsignore's insistence, Honeywell has been a major
contributor to causes as varied as low-income housing and local
theaters in Minneapolis. He just received an award from the College
of St. Benedict near Minneapolis for his leadership in transforming
some of the city's poorer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   lthough he has pledged to continue Honeywell's local
philanthropy, the city's officials say it won't be the same.
``Michael is hands-on,'' said Sharon Sayles Belton, mayor of
Minneapolis. ``He doesn't send delegates to meetings; he shows up
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Local businessmen may miss him, too. ``He's a better diplomat
than I am _ he knows when to bite his tongue _ but he is unerring
in his ability to keep meetings focused on the issues,'' said
William W. George, chairman of Medtronic, who has been a friend of
Bonsignore for 12 years and invited him onto Medtronic's board last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore's charity travels with him. Last year, when a grade
school he was visiting in China struck him as cold and damp, he
arranged for Honeywell to provide heaters and floor mats.
</P>
<P>
   Travels to Honeywell outposts often highlighted the celebrity he
achieved among his own employees. ``He was like the Pied Piper,''
recalled James T. Porter, Honeywell's chief administrative officer.
``He'd walk in, and immediately there's this buzz, `Mike's here,
I've gotta see him, say hello.' And these huge throngs of people
would just follow him down the halls.''

   Bonsignore concedes that his familial style may at first confuse
Allied employees, who are used to the more aloof manner of Bossidy,
who retires in April. ``I'm more approachable than Larry, and I
probably delegate more,'' he said. ``But don't mistake that for
lack of resolve. A CEO must be a coach and adviser, but also a
taskmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Suggest to those who know Bonsignore that he might be, well,
just a bit too soft, and they tell of the 20 vice presidents he
dismissed soon after he was made chief and of the lax performers he
has pushed out since then. ``Allied people keep calling, asking
what he's like,'' said Porter, who will stay with the merged
company. ``I tell them, he'll insist you call him Mike, he'll be
communicative and warm. But, I also tell them how tough he is. If
someone isn't performing well, he'll take them out.''

<P>
   Suddenly, the world seems smitten by the prospects of
fixed-wireless technology _ the fast-growing industry niche that
links users to high-speed telecommunications networks through
disk-shaped antennae instead of expensive fiber optic or T-1 lines.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, Liberty Media Group _ the AT&AMP;T affiliate controlled
by John Malone _ signed a deal worth around $3 billion that will
give it, among other things, a 41 percent position in Teligent
Inc., a fixed-wireless provider based in Vienna, Va. The same day,
Qwest Communications International, a long-distance provider, said
it and other investors planned to pay $251 million for a 48 percent
stake in Advanced Radio Telecom of Bellevue, Wash., another
fixed-wireless concern.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals have focused increased attention on Winstar
Communications of New York, the nation's largest fixed-wireless
company, operating in 33 markets.
</P>
<P>
   Winstar's shares have climbed 38.8 percent this year, to $54.125
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The question for prospective investors is whether to buy the
recently marked-up shares of Winstar or to wait, and possibly miss
a further climb, especially given that Winstar is often rumored to
be in the sights of an acquirer. (A spokesman for Winstar declined
to comment on a possible acquisition.)
</P>
<P>
   Winstar, which is spending heavily to build its network, has
posted losses since 1993, when it went public. Last year, it lost
$444.7 million, or $11.96 a share, on sales of $244.4 million. But
it has told analysts that it expects earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to be positive by the first
quarter of 2001 and that it will turn a profit by year-end 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like a long time. But the payoff could be big: The
fixed-wireless industry, which had sales of $103 million in 1998,
should grow to $8.5 billion in 2007, according to Pioneer
Consulting of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   John Hodulik, an analyst at Paine Webber, agrees that the market
for these services is just beginning to take off. ``The real value
is going to emerge over the next 12 to 24 months,'' Hodulik said.
</P>
<P>
   By at least one measure, Winstar is cheap. Hodulik puts its
enterprise value, the amount that an acquirer could be expected to
pay for the company, at $5.6 billion, versus $4.3 billion for
Teligent, Winstar's major rival. Yet Winstar's market
capitalization is $2.6 billion, while Teligent's is $2.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts are concerned about Winstar's ability to keep
pace. ``There are a lot of execution risks if the business doesn't
grow as aggressively as planned,'' said David Heger of A.G. Edwards
in St. Louis, who thinks Winstar will not post a profit until 2004.
In April, Heger downgraded the stock from ``buy'' to
``accumulate.'' He has a 12-month target of $64 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Also of concern to some analysts is Winstar's heavy debt load _
$1.44 billion at the end of 1998, up from $789.8 million at the end
of 1997 _ much of it spent on building the network. To help defray
costs, Winstar has signed several partners, including Lucent
Technologies, which agreed in October to provide up to $2 billion
in financing over five years for purchases of Lucent equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Winstar's recent run-up has encouraged short-sellers. In May,
there were 9.78 million open short positions, equal to about
one-fifth of the shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Unterman, president of GEM Capital Management, a New
York money manager that is a large holder of Winstar stock, said
the short-sellers were being taught a lesson as Winstar's stock
continued to rise. He thinks it will hit $150 a share in three
years. ``This company's just beginning to come into its own,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Southern Co. selling British concern
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. is selling off a large chunk of its
British electric power distributor just as the country's utility
industry becomes competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Southern announced Friday the sale of the supply business of
South Western Electricity (Sweb) to London Electricity, a
French-owned power distributor, for $256 million. The proceeds will
be split with Southern's partner in Sweb, the Pennsylvania-based
utility PP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   Once the sale is completed, which is expected within six months,
Southern will be left as operator of a distribution system that
carries electricity to Sweb's 1.4 million customers in southwestern
England. London Electricity takes over the newly competitive supply
and marketing of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Southern was first in a wave of U.S. utilities to move into
Britain's power sector when it acquired Sweb in 1995 for $1.8
billion. Regulators blocked Southern's attempt a few months later
to take over National Power, a leading British power generator.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has since sold off 51 percent of Sweb to PP&AMP;L for $359
million but retains operational control.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bowers, a Southern executive assigned to Sweb as chief
executive, said Southern was approached in recent months by several
suitors interested in acquiring all of Sweb, but decided to retain
the distribution business.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's utility industry, which became fully open to
competition last month, is seeing a new wave of mergers and
acquisitions. That included New Orleans-based Entergy Corp.'s sale
of London Electricity to Electricitie de France for $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweb has found its role in the deregulated U.K. market, and
that role is one of a distributor,'' said Rick Pershing, executive
vice president of Southern Energy Inc., Southern's international
subsidiary. ``It's inevitable that the U.K. market will see
consolidation of energy suppliers, and it made more sense to sell
our supply business now than try to grow it to the size suppliers
will need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bowers, Southern retains 900 of Sweb's 1,700
employees and most of the utility's revenues. The supply business
accounts for $19 million in annual net income, while the
distribution end brings in $64 million, which Southern splits with
PP&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said London Electricity plans to fold its supply business
into the Sweb operation, creating a base of 4 million customers
that will make it a national player. Because of its French
ownership, the company can receive power from an underground cable
from France.

 &HT;    Thomaston Mills announces layoffs
 &HT;    (Attn: New York, Los Angeles)
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of Georgia's few remaining family-controlled
textile manufacturers plans to discharge 700 employees and close
two divisions by fall. The move by 100-year-old Thomaston Mills of
Thomaston comes on the heels of several unprofitable quarters,
suspended dividends and an expected loss for the fiscal year that
will end this month.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing represents one company's effort to overcome the
effects of too much denim and yarn in the American market and too
little export potential. Thomaston will cease production of denim,
industrial fabrics such as beltings, and yarns manufactured for
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is going through a difficult period, and yarn and
denim segments have been hard hit,'' said Neil H. Hightower Sr.,
president and chief executive officer. The Asian export market
dried up at the same time a spate of imported fabrics and yarns
created an oversupply, causing prices to drop.
</P>
<P>
   The downsizing, which will start in September, will shrink
Thomaston's 2,350-person work force by 30 percent. The company's
denim plant in Zebulon, Ga., which employs 145 people, will be
closed.
</P>
<P>
   This is the facility where Thomaston invested heavily earlier in
the decade in the hope that the then-vibrant market for
American-made denim would grow.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining 555 jobs will come from Thomaston
operations and sales offices in New York and Los Angeles, Hightower
said.
</P>
<P>
   What will remain will be the new core businesses of dyed khaki
and twill fabrics, plus beddings and comforters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be highly automated and very competitive, aimed at
expanding the comforter business and the piece-dyed apparel
business,'' Hightower said, while adding that sales for the year
ending June 2000 will probably be down again.
</P>
<P>
   Since reaching $19 a share in 1994, Thomaston Mills' stock has
been on a downward trend. After trading was briefly halted Friday,
shares closed at $2.75, down 50 cents.

 &HT;    System administrators battle Explorer worm
 &HT;    (Eds: Moving in national (a) and financial (f) categories.
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thursday morning, an e-mail landed in Brent Fowler's
in-box at Socket Public Relations in suburban Tucker, Ga. The
e-mail was from one of Socket's clients, a technology firm in
Raleigh. Normal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler clicked to open the note, then clicked to open the
attached document files.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the attached file, which contained a software
infection called a worm, entered Fowler's address book and sent
copies of itself to everyone in it. It might also have erased the
files on his hard drive. The same scenario played out on the PC of
every recipient of Fowler's e-mail: co-workers, clients, friends,
family.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour, the 30-PC system at Socket was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday they were back up and running. But Peter Baron, Socket
principal, estimates the lost time and data will cost his firm
about $10,000; $5,000 per click.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slammed us pretty good,'' Baron said. ``This is the most
wicked one I've seen. And I think it's going to get worse now that
they've figured out the social aspect to make it seem like it came
from friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The Worm.Explore.Zip bug, the third major computer infection in
three months, hit sometime this week but landed in e-mail in-boxes
in full force Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was socially engineered in a sense, designed to
address itself to its recipients in a friendly fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi (recipient name)'' the initial message reads, ``I received
your e-mail and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a
look at the attached zipped docs.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is harmless unless a person opens the ``zipped
docs,'' a term referring to a compressed file sent with the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   By opening that file, a person unknowingly activates the bug.
</P>
<P>
   The virus attacked computers at Compaq Computer, Motorola, AT&AMP;T,
Boeing, General Electric and Southern Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The messages contain an attached file that, when opened,
releases a software program that can destroy any files created by
Microsoft programs, including spreadsheets, documents and
presentations. The bug is only known to hit PCs running Microsoft
operating systems, including Windows 95 and Windows 98 and Windows
NT.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses this year, computer
systems administrators were able to react more quickly to the worm,
possibly reducing the extent of the damage, said IBM's Dave Chess.
</P>
<P>
   He said for the short-term, computer owners should avoid opening
any e-mail that bears an attachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a file attached to an e-mail, don't open it, even
if it appears to be from someone you know,'' said Chess, a member
of IBM's anti-virus research team in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get one, call the person who sent it and ask if they
meant to. If they did, you're probably OK,'' he said. ``That's
probably the hardest thing to understand. It's tough to realize how
insidious e-mail can be. ``

SERB FIGHTER PLANES SURVIVE NATO ONSLAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO had few more important targets during its air
strikes against Yugoslavia than the airfield at Pristina, the
capital of Kosovo, which was pounded by tons of NATO bombs meant to
destroy the Yugoslav MIG fighters and other deadly hardware based
there.
</P>
<P>
   So how did at least 11 MiG-21 fighters at the base manage to
survive, not only intact but ready to fly? The Pentagon released
aerial surveillance photographs showing the fighters taking off
from Pristina on Friday and flying to safety in Serbia. They had
been stored in a hillside bunker near the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a hardened bunker,'' said Maj. Gen. Charles Wald
of the Air Force, explaining why the jets had survived the nightly
assaults. ``It's actually dug into the side of a mountain that
obviously is made out of granite or something.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said that both ends of the bunker were hit by
bombs or missiles during the air campaign. But Wald suggested that
NATO had held back from using its largest ``bunker-busting'' bombs
against the hillside bunker for fear that it might damage the
runway, which NATO hoped to use eventually to help Albanian
refugees return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This runway has never been struck; we wanted to keep that open
for KFOR, when they went in,'' he said, referring to the
international security force.

AID SHUNS LAWLESS TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAJRAM CURRI, Albania _ Imagine sticking thousands of sick
people, feeble elderly, and children in the middle of the OK Corral
at high noon _ with two feuding and heavily armed cowboys at either
end of the town.
</P>
<P>
   This is the situation in the lawless, northern Albanian mountain
town of Bajram Curri, where the risk of getting shot or robbed is
so high that no humanitarian aid organization, save one, has the
courage to go there to feed the 3,200 Kosovar Albanian refugees who
are virtually imprisoned by the local banditry.
</P>
<P>
   No one goes out at night, when the only sounds from the street
are a cacophony of gunfire and barking dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Shootings? ``Ah, a couple last night, but that's just like
having coffee in Brussels,'' shrugged an international observer
stationed here for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, a human rights monitoring agency.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as Serb shells fell on Bajram Curri, two Albanians
in a car clearly marked as an OSCE vehicle were shot dead, and one
was injured, as they drove out of town.
</P>
<P>
   No one bothers calling the police. The nephew of the police
chief, regional aid workers say, is head of one of the local gangs.
Many journalists have been robbed by masked bandits, and at least
one news organization was the victim of a carjacking despite having
two local police bodyguards with them.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to deliver food to the refugees, police who
were escorting workers for Concern, an Irish aid organization,
refused to go beyond a certain point in the road, saying they were
too scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police don't do anything. They'd get killed'' if they
intervened, said Langis Langois, one of seven OSCE staff in the
town. ``And they won't get killed for $200 a month,'' the average
salary here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE has agreed to distribute food if anyone can get it to
Bajram Curri _ a task only Concern has undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get nervous, apprehensive. But you get used to'' the
danger, said Michael Hilton, Concern's project coordinator, who
with his colleague, David Fraser, recently went on an aid run to
Bajram Curri.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law here, no order, no civil justice system. There
is only the Code of Lek, an old common law observed in northern
Albania. The code is clear: If someone is slain, the victim's
family must murder a member of the killer's family.
</P>
<P>
   The brutality is typical of the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have a reputation for ``ethnic cleansing,'' the forced
expulsion or killing of an ethnic group, but the northern Albanians
have blood feuds that can go on for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees staying in Bajram Curri have been battered by both
worlds: In Kosovo, they were burned out of their homes and forced
over the border; in Bajram Curri, feuds and bandit violence keep
them huddled inside collection centers and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come out only to get some bread,'' said Raz Shabani, 73.
``I'm an old woman, and the strong ones are taking the food.
There's not enough for the refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old boy also hoping to get a first crack at the aid
delivery agreed. ``There's no security here,'' Shemsedim Sutaj
said. ``We are afraid to go out even during the day,'' and so they
rely heavily on Concern's twice-monthly deliveries of flour, sugar,
beans, milk, and peas.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is getting especially dire, said OSCE staff member
Gaston Back, because of several cases of tuberculosis in one of the
collection centers _ illness that threatens to spread quickly.
Still, many refugees are afraid to move, or reluctant to venture
further from the border, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to deliver food in the midst of a Hatfields-and-McCoys
environment is a dicey proposition for Concern and for the OSCE
staff, who have volunteered to help with distribution. The
organizations normally directed to hand out food _ such as the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees _ pulled out of
Bajram Curri last year because of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Wild West,'' Back said. He gestured toward the main
street in town. ``See that white car? That's ours.'' It was stolen
last year, he said. ``There's nothing we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern workers expressed surprise to see vans and
four-wheel-drive vehicles carrying the logos of other aid agencies
cruising around town. Then they realized that the vehicles had been
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   To get along in this hellish environment, international aid
organizations have to make deals with the devil.
</P>
<P>
   The town is basically run by two clans, and much of the violence
is between the two, aid workers in Albania said.
</P>
<P>
   OSCE is ``protected by (one of) the big families,'' Back said.
``They know that if OSCE gets out, they have a big problem. They'd
have to feed 3,200 mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern workers calculate their risk very carefully. They take
only old aid trucks and bring little money, no satellite phones, no
computers, and no radios.
</P>
<P>
   They arrange for an armed escort along the winding border road,
and travel only by daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are refugees there, we will keep bringing
food,'' Fraser said.

 &HT;    WASTE GROUP UNDER FIRE FOR AWARD TO GOVERNMENT LAWYER
 &HT;    640&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of laboring with low budgets and little
recognition, a small organization of government waste-chasers is
suddenly wealthy _ and under fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Project on Government Oversight (POGO), was the chief
plaintiff in a lawsuit that forced Mobil Oil Co. to pay nearly $40
million last year for allegedly defrauding the federal government
out of royalties on oil pumped from public land.
</P>
<P>
   For bringing the matter to light, POGO received $1.2 million as
part of the court settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But the organization's decision to share $350,000 of its reward
with a federal government whistle-blower and another $350,000 with
a retired federal employee is now under investigation by a House
committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Justice Department's Criminal Division has
opened a preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The House Resources Committee last week approved a request by
its chairman, Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, for authority to subpoena
records from POGO and the two ``grant'' recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a federal employee be able to take that amount of
money related
</P>
<P>
   to things that they worked on?'' said Duane Gibson, an
investigator for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were another organization making the payment, people
would be
</P>
<P>
   incensed,'' he said. ``Well, we're incensed that this
organization made that
</P>
<P>
   payment.''
</P>
<P>
   A POGO spokeswoman said the organization was ``very proud'' that
it shared its proceeds from the settlements with Interior
Department economist Robert Berman and retired Energy Department
employee Robert Speir. The two men had for years worked
unsuccessfully to get the oil company royalty payments increased,
said Beth Daley.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that POGO had not made the grants public,
adding that ``in hindsight,'' that was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Young, likening the grants to ``government-by-auction at the
Department of the Interior or the Department of Energy,'' said the
committee had a responsibility to ``understand how such payments
were allowed to be made and how they affected our legislative
proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Young and other oil state lawmakers have blocked rules that
would close loopholes that groups like POGO say allowed the
companies to shirk paying the full royalty obligation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, although Mobil has settled its suit, billions of
dollars are riding on similar POGO suits against other oil
companies. A lawyer who represents some of those companies says he
thinks POGO, Spier and Berman may have violated criminal laws with
the $350,000 payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``A federal employee cannot serve two masters,'' said the
lawyer, Poe Leggette. ``These two employees were either working for
the public or working for POGO. If they were working for the
public, then it was clearly improper for POGO to pay them a
so-called 'award.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Leggette represents Phillips Petroleum Corp., Comoco Inc., Shell
Oil Co. and other defendants in the fraud suits brought by POGO. He
also is a former lawyer at the Interior Department _ where he
helped write the regulations that led to the allegedly fraudulent
company conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing about his activities violates government ethics
regulations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Tabackman, Berman's lawyer, said neither he nor his
client believes there was anything wrong with Berman accepting the
POGO money.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Berman has no authority or influence over any
change in government regulations sought by POGO and has not
promised to do anything in return for the money.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the grants to monetary awards such as Nobel prizes
that are sometimes won by government officials for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations allow government employees to accept awards
in excess of $200 ``upon a written determination by an agency
ethics official that the award is made as part of an established
program of recognition.'' No such determination was issued.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Tabackman said Berman has been writing memos at the Interior
Department since 1986 objecting to a formula under which oil and
gas companies that drill on government lands or offshore waters
were being allowed to pay only a fraction of the royalties he
believed they owed.
</P>
<P>
   The memos did not result in any changes, Tabackman said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, POGO issued a report in which it said that some of
the largest oil companies in the world _ companies such as Mobil,
Shell, Exxon and Texaco _ were using accounting tricks and
subsidiaries to understate the amount they owned the government.
</P>
<P>
   Still there was no change.
</P>
<P>
   Then POGO filed a series of lawsuits under the False Claims Act,
a law that permits private organizations and individuals to sue in
behalf of the government and to share in the proceeds if the legal
action succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil was one the defendants in one of POGO's suits, Daly said.
Additional suits, claiming the government has been defrauded of
more than $5 billion in royalties, are pending against 16 other
companies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Six other public interest groups wrote to Young this week,
charging that the POGO investigation is ``simply intended to divert
attention from the real issue _ that major oil companies have
underpaid royalties owed the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who are lining up against POGO are also among the
largest recipients of campaign donations from the oil and gas
industry, according to a study by the Center for Responsive
Politics. Young received more than $118,000 in donations from that
industry for his last re-election campaign. Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., who has also joined in criticizing POGO, collected
$306,000 from oil and gas interests for his 1998 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   However, Young's aide denied that oil companies were playing a
role in the House committee investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one from big oil came in here and asked us to do this,''
Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merely because there's campaign donations by certain PACs,
that doesn't mean there's influence. This is not about oil. This is
about true and proper decisions that have not been influenced by
outside groups.''

 &HT;    Braves pitchers battle for long-ball title
 &HT;    (Eds: Note time reference in 4th graf.)
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The commercial is hilarious, the Cy Young of TV spots,
and yet it cries out for a revised ending. Yes, Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine still would belt batting practice bullets. Heather Locklear
still would approach the cage and come-hitherly coo, ``Hi, Tom.''
Maddux would bash forearms with Glavine and declare, ``Chicks dig
the long ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the remake, Heather then would ask, ''Hey, have you guys
seen Smoltzie?''
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't happen, right? Maddux and Glavine are Nike guys. John
Smoltz wears Reeboks. Big deal. As Braves pitching coach Leo
Mazzone knows, ``If John stays at this pace, he could have a
commercial all by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   If chicks do dig the long ball, dig this: Here it is, mid-June,
and Smoltz, who pitches tonight against Baltimore, is hitting an
even .400. Not since 1941, when Ted Williams finished at .406, has
a big-leaguer hit .400. It has been 19 years since George Brett's
.390 flirtation in 1980, five years since Tony Gwynn's
strike-shortened bid ended at .394 in '94. Yet in the last season
of the '90s, baseball holds its breath and wonders, ``Can Smoltzie
do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go out on a limb,'' Glavine dead-panned, ``and say he's
not going to hit .400.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What else do you want to talk about?'' Maddux asked, feeling
bigger. ``Me having twice as many homers as Smoltzie?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the season's going to go on and I'm going to have about
80 at-bats,'' Smoltz said resignedly, ``I won't hit .400.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by their lofty standards, these are heady hitting times for
Smoltz, Maddux and Glavine. Baseball's winningest pitchers of the
'90s are also its hittingest pitchers. Yes, Glavine, who last year
won his fourth Silver Slugger as the NL's top-hitting pitcher, has
staggered out of the gate this season. A single Wednesday was just
his third hit of the year, but it improved his average to .120 (3
for 25). In the good-natured, highly competitive batting race among
the three Cy Young winners, Glavine has miles to go before he
sweeps past them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glavine's still the reigning king, the defending champion,''
Mazzone cautioned. ``Don't count Glav out yet. He's always laying
in the weeds. Glav sneaks up on everybody in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, yes. But how to explain his .083 start before
Wednesday's 1-for-2 eruption? ``You know, we play a lot of golf,
and John always gives me strokes in golf,'' Glavine said. ``So I
figured I'd handicap this and let John get off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, there's a lot of carryover from the commercial. I think
I'm going out there trying to hit the ball out.'' This from a guy
with one career dinger. ``I'm going back to the old way, go
inside-out and hit to left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Maddux, a lifetime .178 hitter before this season
with two career homers _ none since joining the Braves in '93. But
in his first start on April 6, Maddux took Chad Ogea deep to left
field for his first homer in seven years. Estimated distance: 380
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get a good wind,'' Maddux said, ``and the ball carries
and the barometric pressure is just right, yeah, I can go about
380.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the afternoon of May 30, though, that truly astounded.
Maddux reached out and homered to right off _ Kevin Brown?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the first time I ever got a hit off him,''
Maddux said. ``You just want to put it in play. I'm hoping, 'Maybe
I can just get a grounder that won't go at anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Long ball. His second in less than two months, after two
in 12 seasons. ``I'm in a tree,'' explained Maddux. A tree? ``In
over my head. I'm like the guy who won playing Lotto. You've got to
be in a tree, over your head, to win Lotto.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, then Smoltz has won the Big Game. A Silver Slugger winner
in '97 with 18 hits and a .228 average, he is 10 for 25 this
season, with three doubles, six RBIs and his fifth career homer.
That three-run, opposite-field blast on Monday overshadowed
Smoltz's 2,000th career strikeout an inning earlier and rallied the
Braves from a 3-0 deficit to a 9-5 victory. And it came after
Smoltz heard a familiar mantra in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all you hear when you're at the plate: 'Chicks dig the
long ball,''' Smoltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Maddux, like Glavine, takes partial credit for
Smoltz's success. ``I think the commercial fired him up,'' Maddux
said. ``I think it gave him the extra push he's needed. If you can
find ways to motivate yourself to be a little better, you do it. I
think it gave Smoltzie that little extra push to lock in up there:
'No way somebody from Vegas hits higher than somebody from
Michigan.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough that he has to live with me being a better
golfer than him. It would crush him if I was a better hitter,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add below.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mad Dog's showing more power this year,'' Mazzone said. ``But
Smoltzie's showing more power and base-hit ability. The ball's
exploding off his bat.'' Pause. ``Of course, the ball's exploding
off everybody's bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Juiced-up ball notwithstanding, what in the names of Hillerich &AMP;
Bradsby is going on here? Is Smoltz using a titanium-shaft
Louisville Slugger? ``Everyone else's bat but my own,'' he said.
``I haven't gotten the greatest lumber. Bats to me are like
putters: Whatever feels good, looks good, works for that moment.
When it runs out, it's time to change.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Smoltz used Kevin Millwood's bat _ the longest and
heaviest of the pitchers' bats _ to smack his homer and then a
single. In his previous start, his first since coming off the
disabled list, Smoltz used Glavine's bat _ the lightest among the
pitchers' bats, with the most barrel _ to drill a double, and then
he used Maddux's for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's not just good wood. It's also a swing thing,
Daddy-O, that differentiates the hitting pitchers. ``My swing's
limited in a lot of ways but produces a lot more power than
Maddux's ever could,'' Smoltz said. ``He pretty much gets ugly
hacks, ugly hits. Glav's more of a (Punch and) Judy hitter with a
good swing. If I had to pick somebody from among the three of us to
not strike out and put it in play, it'd be Glav. The luckiest
hitter would be Maddux.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no, dude,'' Maddux said. ``Gotta be Millwood.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous, at the moment, is Smoltz, who recalls his
even better start in '97. ``I think I got as high as .450,'' he
said. ''But then I went 1 for my last 22, hit .228. Fortunately,
they voted (for the Silver Slugger) before that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit in eight straight games I pitched in, which I equate to
a 40-game hitting streak: Eight games times five (days for each
pitching start) equals 40,'' Smoltz said, smiling. ``So I figure I
was pushing DiMaggio's hitting streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's pushing the .400 envelope _ in mid-June. ``It's all
about matchups,'' Smoltz said. For example, Maddux attributes
Glavine's hitting slump to pitching at the top of the rotation and
batting against the opposing No. 1 starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certain things I don't want to give away that I can't
do,'' Smoltz said. ``I try to use my strengths and not worry about
the weaknesses. Once the weaknesses get exposed, you're done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Smoltzie's got a chance to hit .300,'' Glavine conceded.
``He's given himself a little cushion here. When you hit that good,
though, word gets out, and he's going to get a steady diet of
breaking balls. So, don't count me out yet. Smoltzie's got how many
hits, 10? I just need some two-hit games.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be tough to catch me,'' Smoltz said. ``But when Glav
gets his hits, they come in bunches, and I'm capable of a 1-for-20
(streak). If anyone can catch me, he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, though, and .400 appear safe.''Most definitely,''
Smoltz said. ``Unless I go through a tremendous bunting spree,
where I get my (sacrifice) bunts down. I'd love to have 20 hits, 10
RBIs, 15 to 20 sacrifices. Thennnnnnn . . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'm already leading the team in batting average with
runners in scoring position.'' He's 4 for 5, .800.
</P>
<P>
   ``How 'bout forehead?'' Maddux asked, referring to Smoltz's
hairline, receding so rapidly that it could be timed with a JUGS
gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in batting average with bases loaded,'' Smoltz continued.
``I'm 1-for-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltzie, Mr. .400, paused. ``This is all going to jinx me,
isn't it?''

   Most Popular, Yes, but Most Likely to Succeed?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to stocks, popularity seems to be inversely
related to future performance. That is the gist of a study by H.
Bradlee Perry, a consultant at David L. Babson &AMP; Company, a money
manager in Cambridge, Mass., with $20 billion in assets under
management.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Perry equated ``popularity'' with a high
price-to-earnings multiple. He tracked the performance of the New
York Stock Exchange stock with the highest P/E as of April in each
year since 1982, totaling their returns through May 27, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results: The high P/E stocks have returned less than a third
as much as the S&AMP;P 500-stock index, measured from when they won the
P/E popularity contest through last month. The winning stocks
returned 121 percent, on average, compared with 366 percent for the
S&AMP;P 500, averaged the same way. (The stocks had a P/E of 52 in
their winning years, on average, compared with 16 for the S&AMP;P in
those years.)
</P>
<P>
   Perry pointed to two factors in the underperformance of the
popular stocks. First, they were often in new industries that
piqued investors' interest for a while but then lost their sizzle.
As evidence, he pointed to the performance of Rollins
Environmental, a hazardous-waste disposal company, which won the
high P/E award in 1988. It benefited from stricter environmental
regulations, fueling investor excitement. But the cost of its
services encouraged companies to reduce the volume of toxic waste
they produced. (Rollins, which merged with Safety-Kleen last year,
had a P/E of 34 in 1988 versus just 15 for the S&AMP;P 500; its stock
then lost 78 percent, versus a gain of 406 percent for the index.)
</P>
<P>
   Even when a company is in an industry with staying power, the
very promise of the market attracts keen competition. Advanced
Micro Devices, a pioneer in microprocessor chips, was the high P/E
company in 1984. But then Intel and others moved in. The results:
Advanced Micro, with a P/E of 35 in 1984 versus 12 for the S&AMP;P 500,
is down 32 percent since then, versus a gain of 724 percent for the
index.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the popularity kings have underperformed. Home Depot won
in 1993 with a P/E of 58, versus 18 for the market, and has since
gained 239 percent, versus 196 percent for the index.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's winner, Coca-Cola Enterprises, was down 5 percent
from April 1998 though May of this year, while the index is up 17
percent.

<P>
   How Much Will They Buy When Trading on Line?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some investors are obsessed with trading on line. But how
much are Americans willing to bet in a single online trade without
asking a financial adviser? The answer, according to a poll by
Louis Harris &AMP; Associates, is $4,500, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Men seem to be more aggressive. They are willing to invest up to
$6,800 in one online trade, on average, versus just $1,900 for
women.
</P>
<P>
   And younger investors seem to be more aggressive than older
ones. Those who are 18 to 24 years old were willing to make a
$9,300 trade, versus a limit of just under $6,000 for those aged 50
to 64.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, commissioned by Alliance Capital Management, whose
funds are mostly sold through brokers and advisers, surveyed 1,010
adults in May.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDS WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Betting on a Cancer Cure
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds are becoming increasingly specialized. Kinetics
Holdings, a money manager in North Babylon, N.Y., has filed a
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer a
new fund, called the Medical Fund and the Cure for Cancer Inc.,
that will invest in companies involved in cancer treatment and
research.
</P>
<P>
   An impossibly narrow field for a fund? Many people thought so of
Kinetics' last offering, the Internet Fund, started in 1996. It
returned 196 percent in 1998, and has $670 million in assets.

<P>
   Why do the creators of ``That 70s Show'' feel they need to blast
viewers with a cacophonous, libidinous, and vacuous laugh track
that sounds like a hyena on amphetamines? Guys, your amusing show
brings on smiles regardless of all the force-fed happiness and
manipulative, metallic mirth. Furthermore, it's funny in a sly,
self-conscious, and pot-clouded way, one that calls for snickers,
and definitely not peels of thunderous laughter.
</P>
<P>
   If you can ignore the laugh riot, ``That 70s Show'' is actually
a neat little teen sitcom. It's a sort of TV-series equivalent of
Eddie Haskell from ``Leave It to Beaver'': On one level, it's a
friendly half hour filled with sweet nostagia for the 1970s, for
high school, for bad haircuts and sneaking around with friends in
paneled basements. Set in Wisconsin, it could be ``Happy Days''
with lava lamps and 8-track tapes. But look behind its Farrah
posters and beneath its shag carpeting and you'll find a fairly
warped sense of humor at play _ the sort of giddiness that made the
``Wayne's World'' movies so much twisted fun. Just watch actor
Topher Grace's deadpan face, as he gives his teen everyman Eric
Foreman layers upon layers of 1990s-style slacker irony. He's no
Richie Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though Fox wants to provide ``That '70s Show'' with
a good chance to catch on with viewers. Last season, the series
aired on Sunday nights before ``The X-Files,'' a plum timeslot that
made ``King of the Hill'' into a hit the year before. It begins a
Monday summer run, with new episodes at 8 p.m. paired with repeats
at 8:30. And in the fall, it's set to move to Tuesdays after
``Ally,'' the half hour of outtakes from the popular ``Ally
McBeal.'' But ``That '70s Show'' may never become a mainstream hit
for Fox, simply because it relies on material that could be too
subversive for many viewers. In Monday's episode, for instance,
Eric's mom worriedly compares his zombie-like behavior to the
checklist in a ``Is Johnny High'' pamphlet. What Mom doesn't know
is that he's a zombie because he accidentally saw her and Dad
making love. Meanwhile, he and his friends have painted a giant pot
leaf on the local water tower that looks suspiciously like an
obscene hand gesture.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the show, which was going to be called ``Teenage
Wasteland'' until Pete Townshend said no, is pretty upfront and
nonjudgmental in its references to marijuana. The smoking itself
takes place off camera, but the kids can be exceedingly giggly and
spacey in some scenes, and the Steve Hyde character is predicated
on the sort of government paranoia (the ``phony'' gas crisis'')
that is comically identified with longtime pot use. Every week the
show gives us its trademark 360-degree camera pan, sometimes with
the kids around a table riffing off one another's comments in a
flow of tangents, the bong seemingly one step ahead of the camera.
While ``That '70s Show'' has touches of ``American Graffiti''
innocence, its big-screen analogy would be accurately be ``Dazed
and Confused.''
</P>
<P>
   The young ensemble is appealing, particularly Topher Grace and
Danny Masterson, whose frizzy-haired Hyde is both a burnt-out
radical and an eager kid. Laura Prepon, who resembles Claire Danes,
makes her Donna into more than just the mature girl nextdoor and
the object of Eric's desire; she's also his friend. It's too bad
Prepon looks distractingly older than the rest of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   As Fez, the foreign-exchange student, Wilmer Valderrama milks
more laughs than ever seemed possible from a few malapropisms and a
Latin accent. The kids parents _ particularly Debra Jo Rupp as
Eric's protective Mom _ are also a hoot, as silly as their children
in their attempts at self-realization in the Me Decade. They, too,
are coming of age on ``That '70s Show,'' and you never know what
those crazy parents will do next.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a brief moment Friday morning, the cream of
the Los Angeles political establishment could be found deep
underground, doing something that residents of this sprawling,
car-crazed city hardly ever do: riding the subway. And not just any
subway, but the spanking new stops under Hollywood that, after two
decades of striving, setbacks and billions of dollars spent, have
finally brought the system to just over 11 miles of subterranean
track.
</P>
<P>
   As he dedicated the new terminus of the Metro Red Line at the
fabled intersection of Hollywood and Vine, where old film reels
line the arched ceilings like pale blue stars and cast concrete
columns are shaped like giant palm trees with bright green metal
fronds, Mayor Richard Riordan pronounced it ``truly a great day.''
But the grand beginning was also an ending of sorts, because Los
Angeles' first subway line will almost certainly be its last.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, an extension is scheduled to open through the
Hollywood hills to Universal Studios and North Hollywood, bringing
the total subway to 17.4 miles, from Union Station downtown to the
southern edge of the San Fernando Valley, at a cost of about $4.5
billion, with some stretches costing $500 million a mile. But
further plans for underground lines have been suspended
indefinitely, and last fall voters in Los Angeles County
overwhelmingly passed a ballot measure barring further use of the
county sales tax surcharge that has financed the project for subway
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The fond dream of the late Mayor Tom Bradley, begun in the early
1980s with a self-conscious desire to give Los Angeles the
trappings of a world-class city, the subway opened its first short
downtown stretch in 1993. But from the beginning, it has been
plagued by cost overruns, political infighting, unexpected
difficulties in tunneling and doubts about its usefulness. Even if
ridership reaches the expected level of 125,000 weekday passengers
next year, it will serve only a tiny fraction of the city's
residents who depend on public transportation, and nothing like the
3.4 million passengers who use New York City's subways daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should get out of the subway business,'' Riordan said in a
less celebratory moment earlier this week. ``We never should've
started in the first place, and the only reason we're celebrating
opening these stations this week, and the only reason why we're
completing it to North Hollywood, is that the Red Line would be
virtually useless without completing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, planners hope that tourists in downtown hotels will
use the five new Hollywood stations, which cover 4.6 miles and open
to the public on Saturday, to take in venerable attractions like
Mann's Chinese Theater and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and that
commuters from the San Fernando Valley will use the North Hollywood
stop next year as an alternative to the freeway to downtown. Los
Angeles' low-rise sprawl makes comparisons difficult, but the net
effect will still be roughly akin to a line that ran only from New
York's City Hall to Shea Stadium, by way of the Lower East Side and
Bellevue Hospital Center.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, weekday ridership for the Red Line is about
35,000 boardings, compared to more than 1 million on the city's
overcrowded fleet of buses. The stations are spotless and nearly
empty, the rubber-wheeled trains almost silent and the whole
experience such a comparative novelty that the $1.35 fare still
works on a honor system, in which passengers are expected to buy
tickets (and can be fined if they do not have them) but face no
turnstiles or other barriers before boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Another 60,000 passengers are carried on an interlinked system
of about 40 miles of light rail lines that run from downtown to the
harbor at Long Beach, and along the city's southern fringe near Los
Angeles International Airport, and total ridership of the combined
system is projected to reach 200,000 next year. But in a city where
residents live and work in a hopelessly criss-crossed pattern,
without a single central core, hub-and-spoke rail lines have
limited use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flawed thinking on all of our collective parts was that we
could build a mass rapid transit system that was principally
underground in time to make a difference, time for when it was
needed, and be able to afford it,'' said Zev Yaroslavksy, a Los
Angeles County supervisor who, like Riordan, sits on the 13-member
board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the
system, and who sponsored last year's ballot measure cutting off
further funds for the subway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible,'' Yaroslavksy added. ``What became clear
years ago was that the subway project was on a collision course
with the other transit needs of Los Angeles, first and foremost
buses.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since 1996, the transportation authority has been
operating under a federal consent decree in a civil rights lawsuit
brought by bus riders in an effort to force it to improve service.
It is currently fighting the demand of a court-appointed special
master that it buy 481 new buses to replenish its aging fleet,
arguing that the master has no such authority and that it is
working as fast as it can, with plans to deploy another 115 buses
in the coming fiscal year, bringing its fleet to over 2,000 buses
at peak hours.
</P>
<P>
   Over much of the decade until the suit was filed, bus service
was cut, fares increased and ridership fell as money was diverted
to pay for the subway, and bus riders argue that the system still
slights the poor riders who need service the most. On Friday
morning, a knot of protesters marched up and down Hollywood
Boulevard in front of the new Vine Street station carrying placards
that mocked the MTA's slogan, ``Downtown to Tinseltown in 15
Minutes,'' with an alternative reading: ``From Downtown to
Tinseltown in 13 Scandal-Plagued Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the rail's configured now, some of it will be serving
minority and low-income riders,'' said Erica Teasley, a lawyer with
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents the
bus riders in the suit. ``But it is ironic that politicians
continue to fight for subways. Buses can work well when there are
enough on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the subway has been driven by pork-barrel
politicking that helped determine its proposed route in an effort
to spread the spoils of construction jobs. Despite some outspoken
criticism of the system by Yaroslavksy and Riordan, who is
finishing up a two-year term as chairman of the MTA board, other
local politicians, especially those representing the heavily
Hispanic area of East Los Angeles, have continued to press for
extending the subway _ or at least a light rail line _ to their
neighborhoods as originally planned, perhaps with state money.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that railways make sense as part of a broader
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buses will always be the backbone'' of the transit system
here, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, another county supervisor and MTA
board member who assumes the chairmanship this summer, said at the
dedication ceremonies Friday morning. ``But we cannot afford to put
all our transportation eggs in one basket. There's no single
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has picked up about half the cost of the
subway project and in the past it has been harshly critical of the
MTA's budget and management practices, several times rejecting its
proposed spending plans as unrealistic. But over the last two
years, under pressure from Riordan and the chief executive he
recommended, Julian Burke, the agency has much improved its
relations with Washington, and on Friday the federal transit
administrator, Gordon Linton, was among the dignitaries at
Hollywood and Vine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the ceremonies if the government would be inclined
to support further subway construction after next year, Linton
replied: ``That's truly a local decision.'' But, he added, ``I do
think they have learned that you have to build within your
available budget.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, as cast members from a touring production of
``The Wizard of Oz'' scampered through the station to the strains
of ``Over the Rainbow,'' even skeptics like Yaroslavksy could not
resist an air of celebration. The new stations are each designed to
reflect their local flavor, so Hollywood and Vine pays homage to
the movies, with a yellow brick road rising out of the red floor
and upstairs to the street, while the Vermont and Sunset station,
which adjoins a handful of leading hospitals, has a space-age motif
containing medical symbols and an elevator that echoes the dome of
Griffith Park Observatory in the hills above it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a tremendous boon,'' said Leron Gubler, the
executive director of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, whose
members endured years of construction debris and mishaps, including
a giant sinkhole that swallowed up part of Hollywood Boulevard and
forced the closing of some stores in an area that is struggling to
reclaim its former glamour after years of hard times. ``I think the
new stations are going to be a tourist attraction in and of
themselves. We might even get a few Angelenos to go down and check
it out.''

   Raising Air Fares And Slashing Them, Too
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines raised leisure fares 4 percent on June 2. But
less than a week later, the increase was effectively rescinded when
the airlines trimmed those fares by as much as 25 percent for
off-peak summer travel and capped fares for round-trip travel on
peak days at $498.
</P>
<P>
   David Swierenga, an economist with the Air Transport
Association, a trade group, said that only about 6 or 7 percent of
passengers pay full fare _ ``almost everyone travels on some kind
of discount.''
</P>
<P>
   So do small fare increases make much difference? Terry Trippler,
the airline writer for 1Travel.com, thinks so, and not only because
they are likely to remain after the fare sales end. While raising
overall fares, he said, airlines often eliminate an entire tier of
bargain fares _ though they haven't done so this time around.
</P>
<P>
   _EDWIN McDOWELL
</P>
<P>
   Rewarding Wall Street Careers
</P>
<P>
   Workers may have grown accustomed to tiny pay raises in recent
years, but not so the chief executives of eight big Wall Street
investment houses. Last year, their median total compensation was
$13.9 million, up 27 percent from $10.9 million in 1996, according
to Pearl Meyer &AMP; Partners, a consulting firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures count only salaries, bonuses, restricted stock,
long-term performance payouts and the value of options on the date
they were granted. Add in profits from exercising stock options
issued in the past, and the numbers really soar. Sanford I. Weill,
co-chief executive of Citigroup, made $156.6 million exercising
options last year, and Philip J. Purcell, chairman and chief
executive of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, made $40 million. Of
course, profits from options reflect rising stock prices, which
benefit shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies in the analysis were Bear Stearns; Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette; Lehman Brothers; Merrill Lynch; J.P. Morgan, and
Paine Webber.

   A Fallen Bridge, A Raised Hurdle
</P>
<P>
   What could the collapse of a highway bridge in Connecticut 16
years ago have to do with up-to-date bookkeeping standards? Quite a
bit, when it comes to some controversial new rules that were
approved last week by the governmental Accounting Standards Board.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of government officials say they resent the board's
approval of a plan that will force states and cities to begin
including monetary values of their roads and bridges in their
financial statements. The government officials say it will be too
costly to gather decades-old files of information on bridges built
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rules will also force many governments to assess the
condition of their bridges systematically, a requirement that, for
some members of the accounting board, hits close to home.
</P>
<P>
   The board is based in Norwalk, Conn., and some members and
employees frequently cross a new bridge over the nearby Mianus
River, where the old one fell apart in June 1983, killing three
people and severing busy Interstate 95 for months. Federal safety
officials said the cause was rusty parts and poor inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive over that bridge quite often,'' said Tom L. Allen, the
board's chairman. In board meetings on the new rules, Allen said,
at least one board member made the point, ``Well, look what
happened on that bridge.''

CLINTON CONGRATULATES AIR CREWS IN MISSOURI

<P>
   WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, Mo. _ President Clinton applauded U.S.
air crews Friday for a job well done a day after U.S.-led NATO
bombers forced Yugoslav troops to retreat from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton congratulated the troops not only for besting Yugoslav
forces in the field but for being an example of ethnic diversity
that gives lie to Slobodan Milosevic's policy of ethnic division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all came down from Washington today on behalf of your
fellow Americans to salute the men and women of Whiteman Air Force
Base, to thank you for a job well done, to honor you for the way
you honor America,'' Clinton told several hundred crew members and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hastily arranged appearance at Whiteman Air Force Base
also gave the military a chance to highlight the first successful
operation of the B-2 stealth bomber, the $1.3 billion bat-shaped
radar evader that proved so controversial throughout much of its
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an I-told-you-so day,'' crowed Rep. Ike Skelton of
Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House National Security
Committee and a supporter of the B-2 development. Many members of
Congress opposed the B-2 because of its costs and questions about
its mission after the demise of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The dual-pilot crews here flew 50 missions, each a 30-hour
roundtrip between the Missouri base and the Balkans. Although the
crews flew only a small number of the 30,000 sorties over
Yugoslavia, the B-2 dropped 11 percent of all the bombs that fell
during the 79-day air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   B-2 pilots told reporters that their 30-hour flights began with
some apprehension but turned into a routine. A pilot called Sunny
told of crews purchasing aluminum lawn chairs that they turned into
makeshift beds in their cramped cockpit quarters. Pilots took turns
sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Each plane carries 16 2,000-pound precision-guided bombs.
Whiteman currently has 10 B-2s. Six were used in the sorties. The
Air Force has 11 more B-2s under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the goals of the United States and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to force Serbs to withdraw from
Kosovo, to deploy an international force with NATO at its core and
to return the hundreds of thousand ethnic Albanians to their homes
have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Milosevic accepted these conditions for one reason _ you
made him do it,'' Clinton said. ``Thanks to you and the others who
flew and supported our air mission and those of our NATO allies; he
ran out of room, and he ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president also warned that much was left to be done in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to win the peace,'' Clinton said. ``Those folks
have to go home, and they've got to have a roof over their head
before it gets too cold to be outside. We've got land mines to take
up, and businesses to rebuild, and a future to make. That work,
too, can be dangerous for those who follow in your footsteps in the
peacekeeping missions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also pointed to the varied ethnicity of the crews in
contrast to Milosevic's vision of an ethnically pure Greater Serbia
without the Bosnian Muslims, the Croatian Catholics or the Kosovar
Albania Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look around here. You put the lie to that by the power
of your example. And make no mistake about it, it is even more
powerful than the power of our bombs,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the effort to stop Milosevic's ouster of ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo a ``defining moment'' for the Western
alliance because Milosevic thought its diversity would break its
unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought open societies with free dissent _ where, as you
know, everybody in America was free to tell me I was wrong about
this from the get-go _ he thought that made us weak. But he turned
out to be wrong,'' Clinton said, allowing himself a bit of
boasting.

SOUTH KOREAN NAVY RAMS SHIPS FROM NORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korean patrol boats rammed at least three North
Korean vessels Friday, raising tensions in the five-day standoff in
the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently responding to political concerns that it was dealing
with North Korean intrusions too gently, South Korea's Defense
Ministry also ordered more of its warships to the area. It said
that it had asked the United States to put some of its forces on
alert and said that U.S. troops would help in any crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States did not put any of its 37,000 troops in
South Korea on alert, and the U.S.-led United Nations Command
called for talks between generals on the two sides to help ease the
dispute. North Korea has not responded to the call for talks.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's actions Friday were a surprise, because generally
the South has been relatively patient and conciliatory toward the
North. But the government of President Kim Dae-jung has been
strongly criticized by the opposition party for being soft on the
North, and the government may have decided as a result to be more
forceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation came close to an armed clash,'' The Associated
Press quoted a member of the National Assembly, Han Young-soo, as
telling reporters after he received a briefing by navy officials.
``After the collision, the North Korean ships trained their guns at
us, and we responded in kind. It was a close call.''
</P>
<P>
   No shots were fired, and the six North Korean naval vessels in
the area initially retreated after the ramming. At least one had a
hole in its hull and was taking on water and had to be towed,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, several North Korean vessels returned to
the area, and the standoff continued.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the confrontation has been sketchy and often
contradictory, but it seems to have begun Monday when several North
Korean patrol boats escorted fishing vessels into rich crab-fishing
grounds that South Korea regards as its own. The fishing grounds
are in a buffer zone south of the ``northern limit line,'' which
the South treats as the demarcation line between North and South in
the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The North has never acknowledged the line as the boundary, and
its ships venture south of it about 30 times a year, particularly
in the crab season. But while North Korean vessels normally back
off in the face of South Korean warships, this time they stood
their ground.
</P>
<P>
   There are various theories about what North Korea was up to. One
is that it was simply after crabs because food is so scarce in the
North. Another is that it was testing the South's will. A third is
that the North is preparing to negotiate with the West and has
found that it always gets more in negotiations if it reminds
everyone that war remains a real possibility on the Korean
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of confrontation as a bargaining tactic arises
because the Clinton administration is proposing to lift sanctions
against North Korea if it is willing to give up its long-range
missiles and take other measures to reduce tensions. North Korea
and Japan are also edging toward a resumption of talks on
normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   As for the South, Capt. Shin Han-Woo, a Defense Ministry
spokesman, explained its tough actions as a show of force to teach
the North a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep them out of the buffer zone and we wanted to
display our firm will that we will not hesitate to deal with
violations,'' Capt. Shin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Defense Minister Cho Seong-tae had met the top U.S.
military commander in South Korea, Gen. John Tilelli, on Thursday
morning and asked him to put some U.S. troops on alert in case the
situation deteriorated. ``We do not intend to take military action,
but if such incidents happened, the U.S. Command would help us,''
said Shin, in what appeared to be a warning to the North.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Carl Kropf, a spokesman for the U.N. Command, said that the
command regarded the North Korean intrusion as a provocative act
but that no forces had been placed on alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching the situation very closely and are in dialogue
with the South Koreans,'' he said.

INTERNET AUCTION GOES DOWN, ANGERING DEALERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a company's Internet site breaks down, it usually means a
minor annoyance for consumers and a costly embarassment to the Web
site owners. But when eBay, the world's largest Internet auction
service, was knocked out of service late Thursday, the breakdown
put Tom Ostrowski of Cincinnati temporarily out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell need to make a lot of money right now, and it's
killing me,'' says Ostrowski, who made $6,000 last month selling
used books and old magazines on eBay. ``All my eggs are in the eBay
basket,''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of eBay entrepreneurs like Ostrowski are fuming over
the outage, which was caused by a faulty database server computer.
Friday night, eBay was still out of commission. So were angry eBay
dealers, who say they'll start peddling their merchandise at other
on-line auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fulton, a Fredericksburg, Va. dealer in Civil War
memorabilia, said he will start listing 40 percent of his
merchandise on an auction site run by the popular Internet portal
Yahoo. As for eBay, ``I think we are very nearly through with
counting on them to provide a major source of our income,'' Fulton
said.
</P>
<P>
   eBay's success at attracting merchants like Fulton is one of the
keys to its success. Since it debuted in 1995, the company has
grown to host 1.8 million auctions at any given time, with over
250,000 new items posted on a typical day. The sheer number of
items available on eBay attracts millions of potential buyers, who
in turn attract still more sellers. eBay makes its profit by taking
commissions and listing fees on every sale.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay has a history of spotty reliability. The Thursday
outage follows a similar incident on Wednesday. Before that, eBay
suffered a major breakdown in May and briefer outages last December
in the midst of the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Internet firms have suffered outages. The America
Online computer network was knocked off-line for 19 hours in August
of 1996. Then in December, the company's new flat-rate pricing
scheme boosted usage levels to the point where many subscribers
couldn't get through at any price. AOL ended up paying refunds to
angry customers and spending $100 million to upgrade the system.
More recently, major Internet on-line trading firms like ETrade
have been socked by serious technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the breakdown could be especially painful for eBay, due to
its unusual blend of commerce and populism. The company has
fostered an on-line community where buyers and sellers spend hours
discussing their lives as well as their latest bargains. According
to statistics from Media Metrix Inc., eBay's seven million monthly
users spend an average of two hours at the site, compared to just a
few minutes a month at most other sites.
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Swerdlow, senior analyst at Jupiter Communications LLC in
New York, warns that this kind of loyalty won't survive frequent
service outages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say eBay's number-one priority at this point is to get
their arms around this problem,'' Swerdlow said.
</P>
<P>
   eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove (cq) expressed embarrassment and
concern over his firm's recent stumbles. ``In our first two or
three years we were up and running, we were always proud of the
fact that we were up 98, 99 percent of the time,'' Pursglove said.
``Something has changed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, eBay dealers are sizing up their options. Marsha
Collier of Los Angeles, a long-time eBay user who has just written
a book on Internet auctions, refuses to panic. ``When we're dealing
with computers, for gosh sakes, they're going to go down,'' Collier
said. ``Things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's taking steps to avoid losing money on her auctions
of Beanie Babies and Star Trek action figures. Auctions last for
one week, and Collier said that the loss of a day's bidding will
depress prices to an artificially low level. That's why she's
sending e-mails to everybody who bid on an item before the system
crashed to tell them that the auction is cancelled.
</P>
<P>
   Collier said she'll restart her auctions once eBay is up and
running again. But she pointed out that because many eBay users
probably won't cancel their auctions, smart eBay buyers should go
looking for good deals as soon as the site reopens. ``There's going
to be some great bargains on eBay,'' Collier said.

CHIEF RABBI CREATES A FUROR WITH REQUEST TO `MR. POPE'
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ Seizing his moment in a receiving line,
Poland's chief rabbi brushed past protocol Friday to ask Pope John
Paul II to remove a large cross at the walls of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a favor to ask Mr. Pope,'' the chief rabbi, Pinchas
Monachem Joskowicz, said after introducing himself as a survivor of
the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz who ``can still hear the crying of
the children.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the pope that this cross ``is like a stop, a `halt'''
that disturbs his prayers. ``I ask Mr. Pope to give a call to his
people to also take this cross away from the camp.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's appeal, which was televised live, shocked many
Polish viewers and resurrected a painful issue that Catholic and
Jewish leaders in Poland have been seeking to smooth over during
the papal visit.
</P>
<P>
   The chief rabbi's timing was as jarring as his words. The
79-year-old pope had just laid out his vision for a new Polish
democracy founded on tolerance and spiritual values in a speech to
Parliament that brought into the same room Lech Walesa, the founder
of the independent trade union Solidarity, and Wojciech Jaruzelski,
the Communist Party leader who imposed martial law in 1981,
crushing the Solidarity movement. The pope was preparing to pray
alongside leaders of Jewish groups at the Holocaust memorial in
Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was an unexpected reminder that even as the pope
was pleading for unity and understanding, the wounds of World War
II remained open.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who on Sunday plans to beatify 108 Catholics killed
by the Nazis, has long sought to honor Christian Poles who died in
concentration camps with the Jews who perished in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But as Friday's incident demonstrated, a dispute persists over
who suffered more in a war that devastated Poland and all but wiped
out its Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Jewish groups quickly dissociated themselves from the
aged chief rabbi, who retires on Sunday, saying that the setting
was inappropriate and that his way of addressing the pope was
``scandalous'' and ``unjustifiable.'' One Roman Catholic bishop
dismissed the rabbi's comments as the views of an ``extremist.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Catholic bishops have decided that the cross should
remain, Jewish leaders said they were still hoping to remove or at
least reduce its visibility. And that fundamental clash, which both
sides had hoped to keep under wraps during the pope's trip, veered
up at the worst possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the pope arrived in Poland, the government
ordered riot policemen to remove hundreds of smaller crosses
erected at Auschwitz by Catholic militants. But the Catholic
leadership decreed that one 26-foot cross, planted on property that
borders the walls of Auschwitz in 1989 and visible from inside,
should stay. Many Catholics view the cross both as a commemoration
of the pope's visit to Auschwitz in 1979 and a memorial to
Christian victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the pope would consider the chief rabbi's request
to remove the cross, his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said
this was a ``local issue'' that did not concern the Vatican. ``My
impression is that the vast majority of Poles want it to remain,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Stanislaw Gadecki, who heads the Polish Episcopate's
Commission for Relations with the Jews, said of the rabbi's
comments: ``We are not bothered by extremist points of view.'' He
spoke on a sidewalk while waiting for the pope's arrival at the
Holocaust monument on Umschlagplatz, the depot from which 300,000
Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto were taken by cattle car to Auschwitz
in 1943 and 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that he was at Auschwitz, we share his pain and the
pain of all the Jewish people,'' Gadecki said of the chief rabbi.
``But there is the pain of the Polish people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, leaders of Jewish groups were assessing the damage done
by the rabbi to their own efforts to remove the cross that many
Catholics as well as Jews in Poland consider inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To address the pope in that way was embarrassing to all of us,
and it was seen by everyone,'' Stanislaw Krajewski, director of
interfaith relations for the Union of Jewish Congregations in
Poland, said while waiting for John Paul's arrival. ``We thought we
had a good chance of finding a compromise solution,'' he said,
referring to the fate of the cross. ``As of today that effort is
much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajewski and other Jewish leaders complained that the chief
rabbi, who before the war spoke Yiddish and after the liberation of
Auschwitz moved to Israel and the United States, spoke clumsy
Polish that might alienate Polish listeners, as would his failure
to address the pope as ``Your Holiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Few, however, disputed the legitimacy of the rabbi's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I completely agree that the cross should not be there,'' said
Konstanty Gebert, a journalist and Jewish activist. ``But the image
of an insolent Jew treating the most respected leader in the land
that way confirms the worst stereotypes and that really hurts us.''
</P>
<P>
   If the pope was offended, he gave no sign of it. He listened
patiently and attentively as the rabbi spoke, paying no heed to the
Vatican official who squirmed impatiently next to him. His few
words in reply, however, were inaudible to bystanders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Umschlagplatz, surrounded by rabbis and other leaders of
Jewish group, including Marek Edelman, the last surviving leader of
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the pope delivered a prayer for Jews,
asking God to ``support them so that they may experience respect
and love from those who still have not grasped the immensity of the
suffering of the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation was also a theme of John Paul's address to
Parliament, where the country's three branches of government, along
with religious leaders of various faiths, vigorously applauded the
pope's call for a ``responsible use of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in an armchair on the floor of the lower house of
Parliament, the pope said, ``While the autonomy proper to the life
of a political community must be respected, it should also be kept
in mind that a political community cannot be seen as independent of
ethical principles. Even pluralist states cannot abandon ethical
norms in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, he looked back on Poland's tragic history, noting
that Poles, ``in a situation of mortal threat to the very
biological existence of the nation,'' resisted the Nazis by
establishing a clandestine Polish state, ``something which did not
exist elsewhere in occupied Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Many tens of thousands of Poles lined the streets of Warsaw
Friday, eager for what some feared could be their last close look
at a frail pope, who remains a national hero as well as a spiritual
guide.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who gave her name as Hannah, 49, was among those waiting
near the Holocaust memorial. She said that she had watched the
chief rabbi on television, and that unlike her friends, had not
found his words so offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The context was unfortunate, given that the pope was coming to
this place,'' she said. ``But he probably just didn't know how to
address him.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, that she disagreed with the rabbi's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no,'' she said, ``of course the cross at Auschwitz must
stay.''

<P>
   Although the stock market has exhibited relative indifference to
the upward march in Treasury bond yields, rising interest rates are
not good news for equities. In the simplest terms, higher bond
yields _ currently 6.16 percent for the 30-year Treasury _ make
those instruments more attractive than stocks to many investors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the damage from rising rates is neither random nor
universal. As Eric Sorensen, a quantitative research strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney, points out, some industry groups have
historically fared better than others.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen examined the performance of 60 industry groups during
five different periods of sustained rate increases in the last 22
years. The top-performing groups were the oil-and-gas drillers,
which beat the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by 27.6 percent;
the oil producers and sellers, which outperformed by 25.4 percent,
and computer software and services companies, which beat the index
by 23.7 percent.

   Losers included shares of home builders, which underperformed
the index by 27.3 percent; trucking companies, which fell 26.6
percent more than the S&AMP;P., and engineering and construction firms,
which lagged by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even more vulnerable this time is a group that has
produced some of the biggest profits in the current bull market:
financial services companies, including commercial banks, brokerage
firms and mortgage lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Peabody, a bank analyst at Mitchell Securities,
believes that the combination of rising interest rates and the
hefty leverage on the books of these businesses will prove
hazardous to their stock prices. ``Right here and now, money center
banks and broker dealers are most vulnerable,'' Peabody said,
``because they are the most exposed to interest-rate-related
products such as swaps and mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of all derivative products is the interest rate
swap, which essentially allows participants to make bets on the
direction interest rates will take. According to the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, interest rate swaps accounted for
three out of four derivative contracts held by commercial banks at
the end of the year. The notional value of these swaps totaled
almost $25 trillion; 2 percent to 3 percent of that reflected the
banks' true credit risk in these products.
</P>
<P>
   Derivatives of all kinds weigh heavily on banks' capital
structures, as the accompanying chart shows. But interest rate
swaps can be especially toxic when interest rates rise. And since
only a few economists predicted a jump in rates for the first half
of the year when 1999 began _ in fact, yields have risen 21 percent
_ it is a good bet that many of these institutions now find
themselves on the wrong side of an interest rate gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as interest rates rise, Peabody noted, banks' income
diminishes from interest-rate-related businesses like mortgage
lending. ``Interest-sensitive sources of income will be the revenue
disappointments this year,'' Peabody said. Last year it was
trading, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   With Treasury yields at their highest levels in a year and a
half, a rate increase from the Federal Reserve Board at the end of
this month seems all but certain. Stock investors haven't cared so
far. But if rates go higher still, they will. &QL;

POLITICAL RISE OF SUKARNO'S DAUGHTER EVOKES MEMORIES OF YOUNG
INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ To enter Supeni's sun-dappled home here is
to be transported to a different time _ a newsreel era in which
Indonesia was young and a brash soldier named Sukarno ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of Sukarno, Indonesia's founding president, peer down
from two walls of Mrs. Supeni's living room _ one smiling, one
stern _ like relics in a musty shrine. Sipping tea under his gaze
and reminiscing about his tempestuous rule, Mrs. Supeni, 81, is the
very embodiment of a Sukarno loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We adored him because he was a fighter,'' said Mrs. Supeni,
who like many Indonesians uses only one name. ``From the very first
day, I called him Brother Sukarno. He was a friend of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the ghost of Sukarno has hung heavily over this
sprawling country of more than 200 million, as it held its first
democratic elections in 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   The party of Sukarno's 52-year-old daughter, Megawati
Sukarnoputri, seems headed for victory in the parliamentary vote _
raising the possibility that another Sukarno may become the
nation's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   For older Indonesians like Mrs. Supeni, who have burned a candle
for Sukarno since he fell from power in 1966 and died in 1970, the
prospect that his daughter may inherit his power is at once
exhilarating and sobering.
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, Megawati will win,'' said Mrs. Supeni, a regal
woman who first met Sukarno in 1931 and served as deputy foreign
minister in his government in the 1960s. ``Indonesia needs someone
like her at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Mrs. Supeni said Mrs. Megawati, a gentle,
placid-looking housewife who was drafted into politics six years
ago largely because of her name, is hardly a replica of her
charismatic father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that because she is a Sukarno, they will be
getting Sukarno,'' Mrs. Supeni said. ``She is a Sukarno
biologically but not ideologically. I think people may be
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not least Mrs. Supeni herself. She is the leader of Sukarno's
original party, the Indonesian Nationalist Party, which fielded its
own candidates for Parliament and has not been invited to join a
potential coalition with Mrs. Megawati's Indonesian Democratic
Party of Struggle. Less a political force than a historical
curiosity, Mrs. Supeni's party has drawn a fraction of the votes of
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   True believers like Mrs. Supeni are a tiny and dwindling bunch,
consisting of retired civil servants and military officers who
stayed loyal to Sukarno after he was maneuvered out of power by
President Suharto. For the last 32 years, a group of them gathered
weekly in Mrs. Supeni's living room to talk politics and vent their
anger at the repressive Suharto government.
</P>
<P>
   While the older generation talked, their grandchildren marched
in democracy rallies that convulsed Jakarta and other Indonesian
cities last year and helped force Suharto to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of Suharto's rule, Mrs. Supeni said, she was
harassed by the police regularly. She said she eluded prison only
because Suharto's wife once publicly greeted her at a reception _
sending a message that her husband had decided to tolerate her
low-key dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to come into my house and say, `Why do you keep
these pictures up?''' she said. ``I would reply, `Why not?'''
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's relatively benign treatment of Mrs. Supeni underscores
how he grappled with his predecessor's legacy. He pilloried Sukarno
for his economic policy, which by the mid-1960s had plunged
Indonesia into an economic crisis as dire as today's.
</P>
<P>
   But Suharto also understood that many Indonesians regarded
Sukarno as a hero. He was the warrior who drove the Dutch out of
Indonesia, the builder who fashioned a nation out of a far-flung
archipelago. And with his jet-black hair and slick sunglasses, he
cut a deeply romantic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is appealing, above all, because he is seen as the reverse
of Suharto,'' said Herb Feith, a lecturer at Gadjah Mada University
in Jogjakarta. ``Sukarno was honest, Suharto is corrupt. Sukarno
was exciting, Suharto is boring. Sukarno died relatively poor,
Suharto is notoriously rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is more complicated. In his later years,
Sukarno became isolated and repressive. His economic policy, which
consisted largely of spurning aid from the West, left Indonesia in
a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Suharto government became deeply unpopular, Sukarno's
failings did not seem to matter. During the 1987 elections,
thousands of young people wore Sukarno T-shirts to political
rallies. The cult of Sukarno grew so rapidly that the authorities
banned the T-shirts in the 1992 election.
</P>
<P>
   When the Suharto government fell last year, Sukarno re-emerged.
During this year's campaign, posters and T-shirts for the
Democratic Party featured his face looming just behind his
daughter's. Mrs. Megawati did not hesitate to capitalize on her
father's celebrity while campaigning. She has told advisers that
she communes with his spirit for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always says that her teacher in politics was her father,''
said Dimyati Hartono, a legal adviser to Mrs. Megawati and a
professor at the University of Indonesia who keeps Sukarno
memorabilia is his office.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Schwarz, the author of ``A Nation in Waiting'' (1994), a
political history of modern Indonesia, said, ``Megawati seen as a
unifier, a nation-builder, someone who gives Indonesians a sense of
nationhood.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is exactly what Sukarno was remembered for. And
that is the main reason that Mrs. Supeni _ despite her reservations
about Mrs. Megawati's style _ cannot help supporting the daughter
of her idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am loyal to all Sukarno's children,'' she said. ``If there
is a chance for them to make something out of themselves, then why
not?''

NEW BEETLE ADS POINT TO THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking to be in the forefront of a trend in cross-marketing, a
television ad invites viewers to check out the new turbocharged
version of Volkswagen's updated Beetle on a Web site called
turbonium.com.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the TV ad introduces a story line, and the story
line is continued and reinforced on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying this is the wave of the future, but it could
be,'' said chief creative officer Ron Lawner of Arnold
Communications, the Boston agency that created both the ad and the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have used traditional advertising to drive
traffic to their Web site. Remember the Super Bowl ad that
stampeded eyeballs to a Victoria's Secret Internet fashion show?
But these efforts are often for products that cost under $200.
</P>
<P>
   Now cross-marketing techniques are pitching cars. While most car
manufacturers have informational Web sites that contain echoes of
their ads, it is believed that the new VW spot is one of the first
examples of a car maker directly tying together a TV ad, a car
model, and special Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The VW ad is a spoof of a newscast. There's been a scientific
breakthrough, an announcer says. Turbonium has been discovered. Put
it in a Beetle, and the Beetle can attain warp speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Images in the TV ad were carefully selected so they would be
equally effective when viewed on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integration of Web marketing and traditional advertising
is increasing rapidly,'' noted Larry Weber, chief executive of
Weber Public Relations Worldwide, a firm that has done a lot of
Internet marketing. ``The Web could become the largest showroom in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In the not too distant future, ``you're going to see a lot of
ads that say, `Come to our Web site and take a virtual test drive,'
'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For companies that want to sell products to young adults, the
Web has special appeal. Many young adults are turned off by the
hard sell of conventional advertising but seem more receptive to
marketing on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the inspiration for the turbonium campaign came from an
earlier VW ad created by Arnold. That ad showed a couple driving a
VW through New Orleans, all the street scenes in time with the
music of an original sound track.
</P>
<P>
   The VW Web site received so many inquiries about the ad that
Arnold decided to marry a future TV ad to a special Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times you'll see a fun TV ad, but when you go to the
company's Web site, it's all business,'' said Arnold creative
director Alan Pafenbach. ``We felt if we could continue the fun of
the TV experience on the Internet, people will come and stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the turbonium.com site to be regularly upgraded
with fresh content.

RELIGION COLUMN: GRAND MUFTI OF KOSOVO: AT HOME IN A ZONE OF GOD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Turkey)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Rexhep Boja, the Grand Mufti of Kosovo, left New York last
Sunday for Istanbul. As of Friday, he was heading for the refugee
camps in Albania and Macedonia so that he could be with people as
they faced the joys and terrors of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Home for Boja himself is what it is for many other Kosovars: a
burned-out dwelling, in Pristina in his case, from which he and his
family were driven at gunpoint shortly after the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<P>
   But home for Boja (pronounced BOY-ah) also seems to be a
remarkable zone of faith in God, in the future and in human nature
_ a zone where sorrow nests, but no discernible trace of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   The Mufti was a marked man. As the elected religious leader of
Kosovo's Muslims, he had long been harassed, arrested and
interrogated by Yugoslav officials. Then he led the funeral prayers
for Bajram Kelmendi, a neighbor and prominent human rights
advocate. Kelmendi and two sons were seized on the first night of
the bombing; their corpses were found two days later.
</P>
<P>
   It was lunchtime not long afterward when armed men arrived at
Boja's home. Forced entrance, orders to lie on the floor, demands
for money, seizure of documents, house set aflame, the march to the
train, people shoved into the cars through open windows _ the
sequence is by now all too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 miles to the Macedonian border took eight hours. At each
prolonged halt, the huddled passengers feared they were about to be
shot, or used as shields against NATO bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I was praying and depending on God,'' Boja said, ``and
many people were saying, `Pray for us.' Everyone was scared.''
Sitting in a Manhattan hotel restaurant next to a translator, he
raised his eyes to heaven and threw up his hands in a manner
expressing a state of both helplessness and supplication.
</P>
<P>
   It was an expansive gesture for this grave, neatly bearded man
in a dark suit who most often bent forward as he spoke and made
small, graceful circles with his cupped hands, like a potter
rounding, shaping and smoothing his words into reality. It was
typical that he concluded his story of flight with a plea: Please
don't sensationalize it so as merely to stir up more passion.
</P>
<P>
   Boja was in the United States under the auspices of the World
Conference on Religion and Peace, a worldwide coalition of
religious leaders addressing issues of conflict resolution, human
rights and economic development. The organization is convinced that
cooperation among Balkan religious leaders will be an essential
component of any future reconstruction and reconciliation in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Boja expressed deep disappointment that Kosovo's Serbian
Orthodox leaders had never condemned the ethnic cleansing and
anti-Albanian terror. Then he quickly qualified his remarks.
``Maybe myself I would try to find some excuse for the Orthodox
leadership,'' he said, ``because we know the mentality of the
Communist regime: if any priests said a single word, they could pay
with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boja, there was clear continuity between the anti-religious
attitudes of the earlier ``communist regime'' and the current
Belgrade Government's efforts to inflame and manipulate religious
feelings. As a youth, he was spurned by Communist organizations and
condemned by Communist publications for his devotion to Islam. To
study his faith, he had to go abroad, earning a doctorate in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Today's government, he said, ``tried to play the religious
card,'' deliberately offending Muslim sensibilities in hope of
provoking reactions that would substantiate government ``slogans
about `jihad.'''
</P>
<P>
   He challenged the widespread impression that Balkan history is
nothing but a chronicle of religious warfare. In Kosovo, it is
quite the contrary, he said: three religious communities _ Muslim,
Orthodox and Roman Catholic _ long coexisted peacefully. There are
sacred sites of the Serbian Orthodox in Kosovo, he said, that for
many years have been in the safekeeping of Albanian Muslim
Kosovars, who consider them part of a national heritage and spared
them damage even as ethnic conflict grew acute. In earlier years,
imams and priests were often jailed by communist officials in the
same cells, and emerged friends.
</P>
<P>
   Boja's hopes for the future brightened even while he was in New
York. The conversation in the restaurant took place before the
Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, accepted NATO's terms; it
continued, four days later, after that initial acceptance, over tea
at the home of William F. Vendley, secretary general of the World
Conference on Religion and Peace.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to remain constant, however, was his conviction
that, with the aid of ``civilized nations'' _ first among them the
United States, in his eyes a model of religious pluralism _
reconstruction and tolerance could overcome bitterness and revenge.
</P>
<P>
   At moments during the talk at Vendley's home, it was hard not to
think the Mufti naive. Yet only that morning he had been visiting
refugee families at Fort Dix, N.J., and he knew that he would soon
be counseling families learning not only of destroyed homes and
livelihoods but also of murdered sons and raped daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to visit, advise, encourage and guide the families,
psychologically and spiritually,'' he said, ``and help them look to
the future, not be caught in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Boja discouraged by the fact that the Islamic center in
Pristina, which had also functioned as a civic and educational
center with newly installed computer technology, was now gutted:
``Even the spoons were taken and everything shot up with machine
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Vendley recalled having been welcomed there in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will come again,'' the Mufti said softly.

   Jordan Shows His Hand
</P>
<P>
   Having dealt his way out of a job by turning Westinghouse, the
appliance maker, into CBS, the network, Michael H. Jordan has dealt
his way back into another job, and in a manner characteristic of
the times. Last week, the Clarant Worldwide Corp., which aims to
help major corporations and new Internet ventures do business on
line, filed for a $150-million-plus public offering, for 30.7
percent of the company, with Jordan as chairman. Clarant, based in
Dallas, will be formed from eight companies that it has agreed to
acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan yielded the top CBS job to Mel Karmazin, a far more
experienced broadcasting executive, on Jan. 1. Turns out, however,
that Jordan has learned a thing or two about matters digital. He
has been on the Dell Computer board since 1992 and the
Marketwatch.com board since last June. He is also involved in
ventures range from webcasting to Internet document encryption.
Jordan will leave the company's operations in the hands of
Clarant's chief executive and founder, Guillermo G. Marmol.

   Celebrity Celebrations
</P>
<P>
   From women's fashion to general interest, magazines hardly let a
month pass without putting more actresses and pop stars on their
covers. Weightier publications compete for contributions by
renowned writers. And the celebrities are used to being treated
like, well, celebrities. While a model might be happy with a few
celery sticks, a celebrity requires some public prandial pampering.
</P>
<P>
   In October, when Vogue's editor in chief, Anna Wintour, featured
Oprah Winfrey on a cover, Ms. Winfrey got a grand cocktail party
for a few hundred friends at the restaurant Pravda. This spring,
Tina Brown threw a lavish dinner for Martin Amis, the British
writer, at her apartment and invited Harrison Ford and David Bowie.
Ms. Brown announced last week that her Talk Media group had signed
Amis for three books, a screenplay and several magazine articles.
Last month, when The New Yorker published a story by Salman
Rushdie, David Remnick, the editor, threw a dinner party for a
hundred and fifty at Il Cantinori.
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, Elle magazine hosted an eight-course dinner at
Bond St., an upscale Japanese restaurant, to celebrate Jennifer
Lopez's cover. Sony music? chairman Tommy Mottola and Robert DeNiro
mingled with executives from L'Oreal and the advertising agency
McCann-Erickson. The cost? For about 40 diners, anywhere from
$5,000 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not a contest to see whose dinner party is bigger or
more expensive, said Keith Estabrook, a publicist for Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines, which publishes Elle. ``It brings the product
to life,'' Estabrook said. ``It's the people who are in the
magazine, who read the magazine or that should be in the
magazine.'' All that, and everyone got a free tube of L'Oreal
mascara.

   Brimming With Wealth
</P>
<P>
   C. Everett Koop, 82, the bearded apostle of well-informed
patients, critic of managed care, and battler against health
hazards from Big Tobacco to big bellies, once spoke disdainfully of
big bucks. He was already a reknowned pediatric surgeon when he
joined the Reagan Administration, and as a crusading Surgeon
General, he valued candor over political discretion. ``I did not
come here having to prove anything to myself,'' he said in 1987,
``and I was not looking for a six-figure job afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Koop became an eight-figure lord of the Internet
last week. Drkoop.com, his consumer-health startup, went public on
Tuesday at $9, soared to $20.25, and closed Friday at $15.8125,
valuing his 2.5 million shares at $39.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Koop Web site faces what David Restrepo, an analyst at
Jupiter Communication, calls ``a ton of competition.'' An estimated
15,000 Internet health sites range from cyberquacks to pillars of
science like mayohealth.org. Still, Chick Koop, as some medical
colleagues call him, is arguably the best-known doc since Benjamin
Spock. ``He has the persona to nudge patients and physicians
towards better health care,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey, president of
the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Koop himself was understandably euphoric last week, but he cited
improved public health rather than his improved private wealth as
the reason. ``My special delight about this,'' he said, ``is it
provides me with an opportunity to get my message out to people _
that they have to take care of their own health.'' _MILT

PLANTS THAT MAKE LIFE EASIER FOR WATER CARRIERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, June 13)  
(DW) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If house lots were all designed by efficient gardeners, there
might never be a need to carry water in a bucket to a thirsty
plant. All ornamental beds would be within easy reach of a
sprinkler.
</P>
<P>
   But every dwelling I've inhabited that had a yard also had a
little patch of flowers or shrubbery in a sun-baked spot that was
inconvenient or difficult to water. One was at the far end of the
driveway, the maximum distance possible from the outdoor faucet.
One was on a slope where most of the water ran onto the sidewalk.
One was adjacent to the neighbor's rose garden, which resented
having its foliage dampened by sprinkler drift. I watered by hand
to save the neighbor's roses from mildew.
</P>
<P>
   My current abode has a plethora of hard-to-water ornamental beds
in full sun, for which my inefficient nature is entirely to blame.
I didn't design or place them with the garden hose in mind. But I
did choose plants for those beds with a thought to minimizing the
number of times I'd need to water.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Mediterranean natives like lavender and thyme are
content in sunny beds that seldom or never see a sprinkler or
soaker hose. They're far more likely to die in constantly moist
soil, or soil that stays soggy for days after a downpour.
</P>
<P>
   Domesticated versions of prairie flowers like Kansas gayfeather
(Liatris spicata) and meadowsweet (Filipendula purpurea) will grow
and bloom reliably without the gardener standing over them with a
watering can. Yucca and German iris are both great, and almost any
kind of dianthus or artemisia will thrive on natural rainfall
unless you live in a desert or semidesert area.
</P>
<P>
   Two personal favorites are butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa)
and cushion spurge (Euphorbia epithymoides, sometimes sold as E.
-poly-chroma). It stands to reason that these plants would do well
in dry areas. Butterfly weed is cousin to milkweed (A. syriaca),
and cushion spurge is kin to flowering spurge (E. corollata), both
common weeds throughout most of the eastern United States. I've not
yet seen the drought that milkweed and flowering spurge couldn't
survive.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly available butterfly weed has orange or yellow
flowers, but there are white- and pink-flowered varieties as well.
All varieties take a very long time to emerge in the spring. Be
sure to mark where you've planted them so you don't accidentally
dig them up.
</P>
<P>
   Cushion spurge makes a neat mound of foliage, about a foot tall
and two feet in diameter. Like most euphorbias, it doesn't flower
in the usual sense but has colored bracts or terminal leaves. (The
family includes Christmas poinsettias, whose ``flowers'' are really
colored leaves.)
</P>
<P>
   The bracts on cushion spurge are a vivid sulfur yellow,
appearing in the early spring after the crocuses have finished
blooming and lasting for several weeks. For most of the year, the
plant is solid green, and in the autumn it turns scarlet. It's
extremely drought-tolerant, hasn't been bothered by any insects in
my garden, and looks good three seasons out of four. I can't find
much fault with it.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing annuals for seldom-watered spots is a little tricker
than choosing perennials. Annuals are expected to produce flowers
and foliage all summer long, which takes water, and they don't have
the deep roots that can tide perennials over in a dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Annual vinca (Vinca rosea) or Mexican heather are good choices
if watering is mildly inconvenient but can be done if necessary.
Both will take hot weather and dry soil, but don't expect them to
survive without water for weeks on end.
</P>
<P>
   Vinca is a low-growing, spreading plant with small, shiny leaves
and flowers that resemble those of impatiens. The flowers are white
or shades of pink, lavender and rose. Mexican heather (Cuphea
hyssopifolia), also called false heather and elfin herb, looks
almost like a small boxwood shrub, except that it's covered with
tiny purple flowers. It is perennial in mild climates. It won't
survive winters much north of Georgia, but it grows so quickly that
it's well worth enjoying as an annual.
</P>
<P>
   If you're desperate for seasonlong color in a sunny spot where
watering is nearly impossible, the hands-down choice is portulaca,
also called moss rose. Like butterfly weed and cushion spurge,
portulaca has all the survival skills of its weedy relatives. It's
a cultivated version of common purslane, called pusley in the
South, which thrives in hot, dry areas.
</P>
<P>
   Portulaca is easy to grow from seed, and there are several good
varieties available that have been bred to keep their flowers open
longer during the day. (Portulaca tends to open its flowers only
when the sun is shining brightly, and to close them in the morning,
evening and on overcast days.) Seed-grown varieties have slender,
needlelike leaves and a habit of flopping over, which makes them
look untidy close up, but they are not stingy with their flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Even better is the vegetatively propagated variety called Yubi.
Yubi has a spreading growth habit. Each plant will cover an area
about two feet in diameter, which makes it useful as a ground
cover. Its succulent leaves look like a jade plant's, its flowers
are twice the size of those on seed-grown portulacas, and it grows
fast.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a terrific plant for tubs and baskets on sunny decks
and porches, especially those with no convenient source of water.
If decks and porches were all designed by efficient gardeners,
they'd all have built-in water taps.

BOND PRICES FALL; FED EXPECTED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American consumers, the backbone of the second longest economic
expansion ever, are not showing any signs of pinching pennies. And
their spending spree is putting continued upward pressure on market
interest rates, with long-term yields jumping to a 19-month high
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile and furniture buying helped push retail sales up one
percent in May, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A separate economic report showed that prices paid to producers
of finished goods rose 0.2 percent last month, suggesting that
inflation was still in check.
</P>
<P>
   But price increases outside the oil sector in crude goods, like
wheat, and intermediate goods, like flour, could signal a
turnaround in the global economy. Such a turnaround would mean more
demand for credit and would put even more upward pressure on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a rebound in Asia gained credibility last week
after Japan reported that its economy grew at a surprisingly strong
1.9 percent in the first three months of the year. Economists found
reason for optimism even after the government rushed to play down
the size of the increase, suggesting the growth rate would not be
sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with everyone that first-quarter GDP overstates the
rate of revival in Japan,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief
economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co. ``But we buy the notion that Japan is now
rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   All three reports strengthened the view of many analysts that
the Federal Reserve will raise its short-term interest rate to slow
economic growth and prevent any surge in prices. Economists now
expect a quarter of a percentage point increase when Fed
policy-makers meet at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Like many economists, Richard Berner, chief U.S. economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, expects the central bank to push rates
up yet another quarter point later in the year. ``The question
now,'' he said, ``is what will the Fed do after that'' second rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The new data and growing concern about how far the Fed might
have to go to slow the economy helped send interest rates higher
again Friday in a very jittery market. The yield on the 30-year
bond jumped to 6.16 percent, its highest since November 1997, as
the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 1 point and
7/32 to 87 22/32.
</P>
<P>
   This sell-off capped the worst week for bonds in 3 1/2 months as
the yield on the 30-year-bond jumped from 5.96 percent last Friday.
The yield has now risen nearly 1.5 percentage points since a
30-year low for long-term interest rates last October.
</P>
<P>
   And as interest rates moved higher Friday, the stock market
tumbled. The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 130.76 points, or
1.2 percent, to finish at 10,490.51.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Talk of bond sales by big investors, which was not confirmed,
and other rumors about hedge-fund troubles pushed the bond market
sharply lower in the afternoon. Some traders said the Japanese were
selling, while others said that big money managers who had waited
too long to sell were jumping in to stop their losses.
</P>
<P>
   And the market volatility is expected to continue as investors
await this week's report on May consumer prices, scheduled for
release on Wednesday, and the appearance of Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, before Congress the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of nervousness about that,'' said Thomas
Connor, head government trader at J.P. Morgan Securities. The
consumer price index jumped seven-tenths of one percent in April,
and analysts now believe that even a more moderate increase for May
will guarantee a Fed interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   Based on various market monitors, investors seem to be expecting
at least a half a percentage point increase in the Fed's short-term
target for Federal Funds, which is the amount banks charge each
other for overnight loans. But one barometer is leaning toward a
bigger move.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Friday the yield on the two-year Treasury note jumped to 5.69
percent, which leaves it almost a full percentage point above the
central bank's current Federal Funds target of 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If that yield moves just a little higher, it will indicate that
some investors are expecting a total move of three-quarters of a
percentage point in a series of steps. Such a move by the central
bank would erase all three of the quarter-point rate cuts made last
fall in a successful effort to calm global financial markets after
the Russian currency devaluation and the near-collapse of a major
hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera of Hoenig &AMP; Co.contends that long-term rates could edge
toward 6.50 percent, rather then the 6.25 percent peak many
analysts are discussing. He argues that much of the rise in market
rates this year reflects increasing demand for credit as the
economy grows, not just concerns about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the case, he said, a revival of the global economy
will put much more pressure on interest rates than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 percent increase in retail sales in May came after what
had appeared to be two anemic months. But with Friday's report, the
Commerce Department revised April sales upward to an increase of
0.4 percent from the initial report of a 0.1 percent. Retail sales
rose 0.1 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
   The May increase was led by a 2.7 percent jump in automobile
sales, a 1.1 percent climb in sales of furniture and other home
furnishings, and an 0.8 percent rise in department store sales,
adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading day differences. Over
the last 12 months, retail sales have risen 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On producer prices, the increase of 0.2 percent on finished
goods in May followed gains of 0.5 percent in April and 0.2 percent
in March.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between May and April was the price of
energy. In April, when the price of oil shot up to over $18 a
barrel, prices for finished energy goods, like gasoline, jumped 5.1
percent. But last month, when crude oil prices dropped back to $17
a barrel, finished goods energy prices were unchanged. The gasoline
index dropped 2.7 percent after a record 29.1 percent increase, on
a seasonally adjusted basis, in April.
</P>
<P>
   The core PPI index for finished goods, which excludes energy and
food, shows a more restrained picture. It has risen 0.1 percent in
each of the last two months and through the first five months of
the year is unchanged at an annual rate. In the same period the
overall finished goods index is up at a 2 percent annual rate after
being unchanged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lift in commodity prices and the revival in early stage
of processing does reflect that the global economy is on the
mend,'' said Berner of Morgan Stanley, ``and that is consistent
with inflation moving higher.''

RUSSIANS RUMBLE INTO YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Throughout the Balkans war, unpredictable,
nuclear-armed Russia has always been the X-factor, and Friday was
no different.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the first foreign power to send in troops in
Yugoslavia since a peace deal suspended 79 days of NATO airstrikes,
Russia has rattled the alliance's long-awaited entrance into the
southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow's unexpected move to transfer several hundred
peacekeepers from Bosnia into adjacent Yugoslavia means much more
than being first. It is a signal that the Russians are determined
to play their own game in the resolution of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders have sought to portray Russia's diplomatic
backing for a peace plan approved by NATO as a sign that Moscow had
joined in the opposition to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials still say that NATO, not Milosevic, was
the aggressor. They say that NATO, as the guilty party in the war,
should not be allowed to command peacekeepers in Kosovo. Russia
wants its troops to take control of a sector in northeast Kosovo
where most of the ethnic Serbs in the region live. NATO rejects
that and says Russia can be part of a unified force under a NATO
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after US and Russian officials in Moscow were unable to
hammer out an agreement on Russia's role in the peacekeepers'
command structure, Friday's move to send in troops looks like a
challenge to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders reacted with palpable surprise. British troops
near Kosovo were put on alert and US Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott turned his plane around to return to Moscow for
urgent talks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO later appeared to publicly accept assurances from Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov that the troops were not going into Kosovo
under a deal could be worked out. But a senior military official,
General Leonid Ivashov, said Russia reserved the right to make a
separate deal with Belgrade on where its troops will be stationed.
Russian news agencies reported that more troops were ready to
arrive in Yugoslavia soon.
</P>
<P>
   Splits and confusion are nothing new to Russian policy on the
Balkans. Most political parties have distanced themselves from the
peace plan, which was helped along greatly by Russia's own envoy,
Viktor Chernomyrdin. Parliament this week passed a resolution
accusing Chernomyrdin of betraying Russia's geopolitical interests.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin's comments Friday did not make clear
whether Ivanov or Ivashov was right, only that the Russian leader
still rejects putting his troops under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on television with Ivanov and a Russian general,
Yeltsin growled: ``We have done all we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing NATO wants is Russian troops staking out their
own territory in Kosovo. But even if the Russians plan to
coordinate their movements with NATO, their presence in Yugoslavia
puts another crimp in the alliance's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO merely suspended its airstrikes after Yugoslavia accepted a
peace plan that provides for Serbian troops and police to withdraw
from Kosovo. The alliance has held out the threat of resuming the
bombing if the Serbs play any tricks. The presence of even a small
contingent of Russian troops complicates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yugoslav troops do not complete the pullout from Kosovo,
will NATO be able to resume bombing with Russian troops in
Yugoslavia?,'' a commentator for NTV television asked.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Russia's move Friday may have caught Washington by
surprise, but it appeared to have been planned with the Serbs, who
gave the Russian troops a police escort.
</P>
<P>
   The troops came from among the 1,300 Russian peacekeepers have
been serving under the NATO-commanded SFOR force, a parallel NATO
officials frequently bring up when trying to convince the Russians
of their need to command KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian politicians and military officials are suspicious
about NATO's motives. Despite the assurances of the alliance
leaders, many Russians believe NATO will be unable, or unwilling,
to prevent the takeover of Kosovo by the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we even talk about Russian troops, we should ask what
the goal of these peacekeepers is,'' said Russian lawmaker Alexei
Arbatov, an expert on defense issues. ``If the goal is to keep
Kosovo a part of Serbia, to stop the violence and allow refugees to
return, then we do not need a heavily armed force like the one NATO
is putting in place. We need 50,000 lightly armed troops under the
United Nations to act as police.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to divide Serbia and allow the KLA to take
power, we should not be involved in this contingent,'' he said.

WEB OFFERS HOPE TO YOUNG PROFESSORS TRYING TO GET PUBLISHED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Pa., N.Y., Mass., N.J., Okla., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregory S. Brown, an assistant professor of history at the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is by almost any standard an
outstanding young scholar. His dissertation adviser at Columbia
University, Isser Wolloch, called him ``certainly one of the very
best students I've had.'' The dissertation committee, Wolloch said,
judged Brown's thesis on the status of French writers during the
Enlightenment ``extremely original, creative, insightful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is in trouble. His pioneering monograph, based on new
sources, has been turned down for publication by several university
publishers because, they said, its focus is too narrow and it would
not sell.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not alone. Caught between growing pressures on
university publishers to make money and shrinking library budgets,
young professors in fields ranging from military history to ancient
Near Eastern studies can't get their work turned into books.
</P>
<P>
   Now help is on the way. Over the last five years, the New
York-based Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has spent $20 million and
teamed up with university presses, colleges and influential
scholars to try to publish monographs on the Internet as a way of
disseminating research and provide a place for young scholars to
publish so they can get tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation awarded $744,000 to the American Historical
Association this year to publish prize-winning history
dissertations. Columbia University Press will administer and
publish the books on a Web site. The project, dubbed Gutenberg-e,
is aimed at expanding the definition of scholarly publishing. For
the first time thousands of pages of source material and archives,
upon which the dissertations are based, would be available to
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the AHA plans to award six $20,000 fellowships to
recent Ph.D's in endangered fields, like African or South Asian
history, European history before 1800, military history outside the
United States and colonial Latin America, so they can revise their
dissertations into books and put them on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to, I hope, create a new kind of scholarly
book,'' said AHA president Robert Darnton, a leader in the effort
to publish books on the Web.``The whole landscape is being
transformed, the landscape of scholarly life in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpublished monographs mean more than a disappointed author. The
monograph is the cultural capital of scholarship. It is, by
definition, original research, usually on a narrowly focused area,
to make a significant contribution and stimulate further study by
other scholars. It is essential for obtaining tenure and as a
building block for future research.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most serious obstacle to online monographs is
legitimacy. Scholars need to distinguish between a book that is put
on the web by the geeky boy next door and one that is judged worthy
by a committee of scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeful that publishing big-name scholars on the Web will help
gain acceptance for online publishing, the American Council of
Learned Societies, an umbrella group that oversees scholarly works,
has applied to Mellon for $3 million to publish works by senior
scholars on the Internet. The council hopes its proposal will be
approved at June's board meeting of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea, almost a necessary idea,'' Edmund
Morgan, a professor of history at Yale University, said of the
project. He is writing an introductory essay to the papers of
Benjamin Franklin, which are being published on CD ROM. ``I
wouldn't have any objection to it going online.''
</P>
<P>
   One well-known historian who is also considering publishing a
work with the council's project is Bernard Bailyn, a professor at
Harvard. ``I am proposing to publish the Jefferson lecture I gave
in Washington in that form,'' he said. ``I'd like to see what you
can do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Darnton said he intended to publish a book and archival material
on 18th-century France online as part of the council's project.
Princeton University, where Darnton teaches, has contributed some
money to putting his research on the Web. ``What I think is crucial
is for scholars to take the initiative in setting standards and
basically mastering this new medium so that it works to the general
advantage of scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone suggests that electronic publishing will replace
academic presses. Even Darnton plans to publish a shortened form of
his work in hardcover. But advocates say it could supplement
traditionally published books and relieve some of the pressure on
scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the Mellon projects suggests that online
publishing may increase hardcover sales. The Mellon Foundation gave
an additional $360,000 to Columbia University Press in 1997 to put
works on international affairs online. Columbia International
Affairs Online (ciaonet.org) has 40,000 pages of conference
proceedings, papers and books online, with 2,000 pages of material
being added monthly. The service has 170 subscriber institutions.
Columbia expects it to be self-supporting with 200 subscribers by
September, said Kate Wittenberg, the editor in chief of the press.
``We have seen no decline in hard sales,'' Ms. Wittenberg said.
``In fact there's been a slight increase. We think people are
browsing and then purchasing.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania, in conjunction with Oxford
University Press, is also using $218,000 of Mellon money to try to
create a digital library of history books for use on the
university's internal network, to see whether digitalization
affects sales of hardcover books.
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars have been caught in a double squeeze. On one side
are the struggling university presses, which are losing their
university subsidies at the same time they're being pressured to
make a profit. Originally established solely to publish
dissertations, more and more of these presses are picking up books
that have been rejected by commercial publishers, who prefer to
focus on potential blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many university presses have stopped publishing books on
certain subjects that aren't big sellers. ``There are whole periods
of European history we don't do at all anymore,'' said John
Ackerman, the director of Cornell University Press. ``We don't do
political and diplomatic history. We focus on women's history,
psychoanalysis, intellectual history. Those still do OK
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the board we try to do fewer and fewer of this kind of
book, first books, revised dissertations,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are the libraries that have traditionally
bought scholarly books. A generation ago, libraries might have
guaranteed a sale of 1,000 copies of Brown's book. Today they would
probably only ask for a few hundred copies. Although budgets at
many university libraries have stalled, the price of scholarly
journals has not. An annual subscription to the Journal of Brain
Research, which comes only with a package of other journals about
the brain, costs $15,203, for instance, up nearly 50 percent from
1995. The Journal of Comparative Neurology cost $13,900. Fifteen
years ago the typical university library spent 50 percent of its
budget on monographs and 50 percent on journals. ``Now it's about
35 percent for monographs versus 65 percent,'' said Peter Givler,
president of the Association of American University Presses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Association of Research Libraries, library
purchases of monographs have declined 25 percent since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that doesn't mean younger scholars have given up
trying to attract a traditional publisher. ``Most graduate students
don't think about what's sexy,'' said Joshua Landis, an assistant
professor at the University of Oklahoma, whose book on why Syria
failed as a democracy after independence won the Malcolm Kerr Award
from the Middle Eastern Studies Association, the top award in his
field. Landis has had little difficulty getting a contract with
Oxford University Press to write a general history of Syria. But it
is his monograph that is giving him trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Landis said his monograph is being considered by a press and he
is making revisions to try to broaden its scope. He said: ``My
publisher's immediate reaction was how do we justify such a short
time span? Can't you make it bigger?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown complained, ``We have been playing by the rules all along,
and now the rules have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not confined to junior scholars. Carla Hesse, a
professor of French history at the University of California at
Berkeley, is the author of one scholarly work, ``Publishing and
Cultural Politics in Revolutionary Paris,'' and the editor of
another, a volume of essays. She is co-director of the editorial
board of the University of California Press. ``I've always had a
fantasy of writing a little monograph on French revolutionary
editions of Rousseau,'' Ms. Hesse said, ``but I know I would never
find a publisher.

RENO BLASTS GOP LEADERSHIP OVER GUN CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno accused House
Republican leaders Friday of undermining a Senate-passed
gun-control bill by shortening the time required for background
checks and changing the definition of a ``gun show'' to make it
easier for criminals and minors to buy weapons without checks.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual attack directly at the GOP leadership, Reno said
the House version of the bill scheduled for consideration Wednesday
would continue to allow guns to be sold without regulation at small
gun shows, flea markets and other venues. She said those outlets
traditionally have been prime shopping spots for criminals and some
teen-agers looking for no-hassle access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current House bill will not require background checks at
lots of events where large numbers of guns are sold, such as flea
markets,'' Reno told reporters at her weekly Justice Department
briefing. ``It doesn't matter to criminals if the event is called a
gun show or a flea market. If they can buy guns without a Brady
(background) check, they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno also complained that the House measure would gut the Brady
law, which is due to expire this year, by replacing its
three-business day limit on checks with a 72-hour limit. Since most
gun show events are usually held on Fridays or weekends, she said,
the 72-hour proposal would hamper the ability of law enforcement
officials to access court and other government documents used to
determine if an individual has a prior record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting the amount of time won't really benefit law-abiding
buyers,'' Reno said. ``The vast majority ... are already able to
buy their guns almost immediately. But the House bill is sure going
to make it easier for criminals to buy guns on weekends when their
state court records are inaccessible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a gun-control measure last month that broadly
defined gun shows as events where large numbers of guns are sold by
licensed and unlicensed dealers, collectors and individuals. The
bill also extended the Brady law, which is due to expire this year,
to gun shows, applying the same three-business day approach to
completing background checks that is now required for store and
dealer purchases
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also required that safety locks or other devices
be sold with all guns, but that provision has been altered in the
House bill to allow sales without locks.
</P>
<P>
   Reno called the Senate legislation ``the common-sense'' approach
to strengthen current gun control laws. But she said the House
changes had ``undermined'' the intent of the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last month, the American people spoke and the Senate listened.
They heard the American people say they wanted to keep guns out of
the hands of criminals and kids,'' Renot said. ``I'm hopeful that
the House will also listen to the people of this country and pass a
bill that makes all Americans, and particularly our children,
safer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill passed with a small measure of bipartisan
support last month on a vote of 51-50, with Vice President Al Gore
casting the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   Its passage, in the wake of the tragic school shooting and
bombing incident in Littleton, Colo., followed a contentious and
embarrassing debate on the Senate floor in which Republicans were
roundly criticized by Democrats and the public for not taking a
tougher stand on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Senate bill reached the House, members on the
Judiciary Committee drew up their own version of the bill with
significant changes recommended by the National Rifle Association.
Although they denied that the NRA, which opposes the Senate bill,
had been allowed to write the House version, they later
acknowledged that its lobbyists did confer with members who were
drafting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of embracing the bill, a number of Republican
conservatives and moderates _ who hate it for different reasons _
have all vowed to vote against it, making it doubtful that
gun-control supporters will be able to muster enough votes to pass
any measure designed to make access to guns tougher.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill, also has announced that he
will not use his leadership position to help pass any gun-control
measure this year, although he supports the idea of strengthening
existing laws and raising the age limit for purchasing a gun from
18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's announcement stunned not only Democrats but many
members of his own party who had looked to him for support,
especially in light of comments he made only two weeks promising to
forge a common position among Republicans on the gun-control issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert got a letter Friday from the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
which urged him to work for swift passage of measures raising the
age limit for gun buyers and requiring background checks for buyers
at gun shows.

RUSSIANS RUMBLE INTO YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Repeats to correct slug . )   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Throughout the Balkans war, unpredictable,
nuclear-armed Russia has always been the X-factor, and Friday was
no different.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the first foreign power to send in troops in
Yugoslavia since a peace deal suspended 79 days of NATO airstrikes,
Russia has rattled the alliance's long-awaited entrance into the
southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow's unexpected move to transfer several hundred
peacekeepers from Bosnia into adjacent Yugoslavia means much more
than being first. It is a signal that the Russians are determined
to play their own game in the resolution of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders have sought to portray Russia's diplomatic
backing for a peace plan approved by NATO as a sign that Moscow had
joined in the opposition to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials still say that NATO, not Milosevic, was
the aggressor. They say that NATO, as the guilty party in the war,
should not be allowed to command peacekeepers in Kosovo. Russia
wants its troops to take control of a sector in northeast Kosovo
where most of the ethnic Serbs in the region live. NATO rejects
that and says Russia can be part of a unified force under a NATO
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after US and Russian officials in Moscow were unable to
hammer out an agreement on Russia's role in the peacekeepers'
command structure, Friday's move to send in troops looks like a
challenge to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders reacted with palpable surprise. British troops
near Kosovo were put on alert and US Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott turned his plane around to return to Moscow for
urgent talks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO later appeared to publicly accept assurances from Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov that the troops were not going into Kosovo
under a deal could be worked out. But a senior military official,
General Leonid Ivashov, said Russia reserved the right to make a
separate deal with Belgrade on where its troops will be stationed.
Russian news agencies reported that more troops were ready to
arrive in Yugoslavia soon.
</P>
<P>
   Splits and confusion are nothing new to Russian policy on the
Balkans. Most political parties have distanced themselves from the
peace plan, which was helped along greatly by Russia's own envoy,
Viktor Chernomyrdin. Parliament this week passed a resolution
accusing Chernomyrdin of betraying Russia's geopolitical interests.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin's comments Friday did not make clear
whether Ivanov or Ivashov was right, only that the Russian leader
still rejects putting his troops under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on television with Ivanov and a Russian general,
Yeltsin growled: ``We have done all we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing NATO wants is Russian troops staking out their
own territory in Kosovo. But even if the Russians plan to
coordinate their movements with NATO, their presence in Yugoslavia
puts another crimp in the alliance's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO merely suspended its airstrikes after Yugoslavia accepted a
peace plan that provides for Serbian troops and police to withdraw
from Kosovo. The alliance has held out the threat of resuming the
bombing if the Serbs play any tricks. The presence of even a small
contingent of Russian troops complicates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yugoslav troops do not complete the pullout from Kosovo,
will NATO be able to resume bombing with Russian troops in
Yugoslavia?,'' a commentator for NTV television asked.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Russia's move Friday may have caught Washington by
surprise, but it appeared to have been planned with the Serbs, who
gave the Russian troops a police escort.
</P>
<P>
   The troops came from among the 1,300 Russian peacekeepers have
been serving under the NATO-commanded SFOR force, a parallel NATO
officials frequently bring up when trying to convince the Russians
of their need to command KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian politicians and military officials are suspicious
about NATO's motives. Despite the assurances of the alliance
leaders, many Russians believe NATO will be unable, or unwilling,
to prevent the takeover of Kosovo by the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we even talk about Russian troops, we should ask what
the goal of these peacekeepers is,'' said Russian lawmaker Alexei
Arbatov, an expert on defense issues. ``If the goal is to keep
Kosovo a part of Serbia, to stop the violence and allow refugees to
return, then we do not need a heavily armed force like the one NATO
is putting in place. We need 50,000 lightly armed troops under the
United Nations to act as police.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to divide Serbia and allow the KLA to take
power, we should not be involved in this contingent,'' he said.

POLICE CLAIM TO NAB MAIN RIVAL OF `HOLLYWOOD MADAM'
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six years after police here titillated the country
with the arrest of Heidi Fleiss, who became known as the Hollywood
Madam, the Los Angeles Police Department said Friday it had
arrested one of her main rivals, Jody Diane Gibson, known as
Babydol, and charged her with running a high-level international
prostitution ring.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ms. Gibson had been running one of the largest
call-girl operations in Los Angeles since 1990, catering to
well-known Hollywood figures as well as the head of a major
corporation and a professional athlete, but they refused to release
names or say how many clients Ms. Gibson had.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Mike Felix said that Ms. Gibson, 41, was arrested on Tuesday
night at a hotel after she stepped into a trap set by undercover
officers. He added that she had been under investigation for about
10 months after the police received a tip from a woman who
complained she had been cheated out of some money after working for
Ms. Gibson. Ms. Gibson is free on $25,000 bail, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Ms. Gibson had been charging fees of $500 to
$3,000 for the services of her prostitutes and that her clients
included men from Arizona, New York and Europe, among other places.
They said she employed 34 women. She operated a Web site, called
California Dreamin', which displayed photographs of more than 25
women, often scantily clad, some nude, from which clients could
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson was charged with one count of pimping and pandering,
police said, but added that they expected to charge her with a
number of felony counts once the investigation was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Felix said that a search of her bags, her car and her home, in
the remote town of Palo Verde, Calif., near the Arizona border, had
turned up detailed log books with the names of her clients and
their particular interests, offering the prospect of a scandal on
the scale of Ms. Fleiss'.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson's mother and her public relations representative
expressed shock at the news of the arrest. A person in the office
of her publicity agent, Edward Lozzi, said Ms. Gibson had recently
recorded an album of dance songs and was about to release it and
begin a tour of Europe to promote it. A previous album of hers was
called ``Good Girls Go to Heaven, Bad Girls Go Everywhere.'' Her
new album was to have been called ``Right on Track.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gibson's mother, Tobe Gibson, reached at the talent agency
she operates in New York City, said that as far as she knew her
daughter was a singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter's never really told me what she does,'' Mrs.
Gibson said. ``She's been singing for quite a while. This all hit
me like a ton of bricks.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her daughter called on Wednesday and they spoke
briefly. ``She said, `Don't worry,' '' Mrs. Gibson said. ``It never
dawned on me she would do something like this. She didn't tell me
anything more and I don't want to know more at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gibson said that her daughter was divorced and had been
living in Los Angeles for some time, trying to succeed in the
entertainment industry. Ms. Gibson grew up near Scarsdale, N.Y. The
person in the office of Lozzi, her publicity agent, refused to give
his name but said that Ms. Gibson had also done some acting. He
added that the fate of her second album was now unclear.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew her said Ms. Gibson cut quite a figure. Her
driver's license lists her as 5 foot 5 inches, with blond hair and
brown eyes. She drives a blue 1994 Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Felix, the police lieutenant, said she had moved her primary
residence to the distant desert community of Palo Verde, in a
modest home on a canal off the Colorado River, in an effort to
avoid detection by the police.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virginia Witbeck did a mannequin spin to show off her coat, a
luminous garment of quartz-pink silk that she designed in India.
Part of a collection she was showing at the Upper East Side
apartment of a banker friend, it looked fit for a Mogul prince. And
why not? It was, after all, cut from the cloth of her fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, drawn by the image of a mythologized East and
spurred by wanderlust, Ms. Witbeck embarked on a personal passage
to India. The grail she sought, and ultimately found: the
semiprecious stones and vibrant textiles that now find their way
into the lavish coats, caftans, evening wear and jewelry she sells
to private clients and a few upscale stores like Linda Dresner in
New York. She spends as much as six months each year hopscotching
around India, from Jaipur to New Delhi to Bombay, stopping at small
villages in between. Along the way she shops and collaborates with
local tailors and gem cutters to fashion her wares. ``You can't
have a real job and do what I do _ it takes too much time,'' said
Ms. Witbeck, a former creative director for Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   But then, why would she want to? A lawyer's daughter who grew up
on a horse farm in upstate New York, Ms. Witbeck would be the first
to acknowledge that she is living a dream. She lodges in palaces
and tents across the subcontinent, ruled by a passion for work that
she calls ``a lifelong research project.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sentiments, and her vagabond way of life, are shared by a
small band of international quasi-bohemian elite who Ping-Pong from
Paris, New York or London to Bombay and New Delhi and back,
thirsting for adventure and fashion inspiration. Mostly in their
30s and holding arty inclinations, they tend to be the daughters of
affluent professionals who led quasi-nomadic lives themselves. Many
have abandoned conventional careers as fashion stylists, editors
and decorators to follow their bliss and dabble in fashion design.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Isabelle Fraysse, 36, is a contributing editor at
French Vogue whose father was a banker and whose mother, a
perfumer, routinely wore couture. Another, Muriel Brandolini, 39, a
French-Vietnamese stylist-turned-decorator who is married to an
Italian banker, shows her diaphanous hand-printed caftans and coats
in the elegant drawing room of her Upper East Side town house. A
third, Marie-Helene de Taillac, grew up in Lebanon _ her father
worked for Elf, the French oil company _ and now travels by jet
half a dozen times a year between Paris, her home, and Jaipur, the
source of the semiprecious stones in her jewelry designs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Taillac, 33, sold an apartment in London three years ago
and used the proceeds and a small inheritance from her godmother to
finance her first trip to Jaipur. ``When you travel as much as I
do,'' she said, ``you can adapt to almost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-confessed dilettantes, these jet-set fashion wayfarers are
unfamiliar with cutting boards and pinking shears. Not that they
care. ``I'm not a fashion designer at all,'' Christina Gitti said
blithely. ``I studied industrial design,'' The head of her own
Milan-based company, Malatesta, Ms. Gitti, 31, now sells
block-printed sarongs and pashmina shawls to Bergdorf Goodman and
Calypso, a trend-setting purveyor of exotic trinkets and clothing
in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fraysse likewise makes no excuses for her lack of fashion
expertise. ``My education is in traveling,'' she said. But her
gadabout background, sophisticated eye and instinct for color and
line gained her entree into the rarefied world of style. It wasn't
long before vanguard London boutiques like the Cross began asking
her for the colorful bags and blanket-size shawls she got in Jaipur
and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few of these women are actually designers,'' said Nicole
Fischelis, the fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, which carries
Mrs. Brandolini's caftans and exotic housewares. ``But sometimes
they are social, and they have good taste. They're exposed to a lot
of travel, and they often sell to women like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They tend to run their businesses with an airy disregard for the
bottom line. ``I have no idea what I'm earning,'' confided Ms. de
Taillac, who designs about 100 pieces a year. At Barneys New York,
her designs fetch from $250 for a pair of fragile earrings to more
than $9,000 for a necklace. ``At the end of the day, I do this
because I enjoy it,'' she said. ``As long as the orders keep coming
in, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She and the others could not have chosen a more propitious
moment. Fashion has embraced exoticism, ornamentation and
high-voltage color as part of a continuing enthrallment with the
East, India in particular. That country seeped into fashion
consciousness several years ago, when designers like Dries van
Noten began spicing their collections with sari fabrics. But the
raj rage also stems in part from a nostalgia for the festive,
free-spirited 1960s, when Jacqueline Kennedy returned from India
laden with shimmering saris, sparking a new Mogul mania.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so later, the designer and socialite Mary McFadden
ventured to Bombay to have extraordinary beadwork done. ``In those
days we saw a swelling of craftsmanship, creativity and
self-expression,'' recalled Jade Hobson Charnin, who visited Jaipur
and New Delhi more than 20 years ago as a fashion editor for Vogue.
Designers today have retraced the steps of a past generation partly
out of ``a yearning to restore to fashion its soul and
individualism,'' Ms. Charnin said.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the force driving Ms. Fraysse, who
commissions her raw silk and linen caftans and dresses, glass
beads, hand-dyed leather albums and canvas bags in India, and sells
them under the ISI label to Barneys and Kirna Zabete, a
high-bohemian outpost that is to open on Greene Street next month.
``My designs are imperfect, but that is part of their beauty,'' she
said. ``These things have nothing to do with a mass market
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   India is once again, as it has been on and off for four decades,
a magnet for spiritually thirsty Westerners in search of the latest
yogi. But for most of these well-bred fashion gypsies, India is
less a spiritual Mecca than a giant bazaar, and a place to act out
their most colorful fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these women may be in love with the myth of India,''
suggested Sandy Dalal, a New York designer whose family is from
Bombay but whose own work refers only obliquely to his roots.
``They are romanced about the place, and they go. Most of them are
genuinely devoted to their craft, but a few just want a joy ride.''
Not that he begrudges them that. ``Hey, if you can afford a joy
ride through all of India, do it,'' he said.

TEXAS FAMILY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT $234 MILLION JUDGMENT
AGAINST RUSSIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ED ASHER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ International protocol might prevent a Texas family
from collecting a $234 million judgment it won against the Russian
Federation, an attorney who represented the Russians said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government could appeal and claim it was never
properly served with a lawsuit filed by Houston attorney Lee
Alexander Magness and his mother and aunt, Houston attorney Brendan
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Or Russia might simply ignore the judgment and wait to see what
happens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with what is really a technical area of the law
and there is some fine hair splitting,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the threshold issue, since you're dealing in the
international realm, is whether they (the family) have followed
proper procedures and protocol to serve the lawsuit on the
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of proper service could force another hearing on the
matter, either in federal district court in Houston or the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who no longer represents the Russian government, said he
did not know what hoops the Magnesses would have had to jump
through to properly serve Russia with notice of their lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly don't know,'' he said. ``The complication is whenever
you're dealing in the international arena, as we are here, where
you have parties who are truly foreign citizens, there are various
treaties and conventions and specific statutes, all of which
complicate the equation that dictates how, when and where these
parties are to be served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what was done'' in the Magness case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Hittner this week awarded the
multimillion-dollar judgment in compensation for the Russian
government's seizure of Magness family ancestral property in St.
Petersburg, Russia, in 1917 and again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Magness' mother, Nina Schroder Magness, and aunt, Agnes Schroder
Atkins, are daughters of Johann Schroder, who in 1917 owned three
valuable properties in St. Petersburg: the K.M. Schroder Piano
Factory, now known as the Red October Factory; a retail shopping
center; and a 30-room downtown mansion, Hittner said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   All were seized by the communists after the Bolshevik revolution
in 1917, he said. The family claimed the property then was worth
more than 16 million gold rubles, or about $162 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism, the Russian government initiated
reforms, including laws that prohibited the nationalization or
expropriation of foreign investments, Hittner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnesses traveled to St. Petersburg in 1994 to reclaim the
family fortune. After presenting historic documents showing they
were Schroder's heirs, the family was assured by Russian
authorities that they would receive titles to the property,
Hittner's ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Magness also purchased two antique Schroder pianos, one
built in 1889 and the other in 1910, according to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1994, the Russian Federation claimed that all of the
properties were ``national treasures'' or ``historical'' in nature
and expropriated them, Hittner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Magness family sued in 1997 to stop the Russian Ministry of
Culture from removing a touring $100 million Romanov jewel exhibit
from Houston. The family asked the judge to hold the jewels as
collateral, which he refused to do.
</P>
<P>
   The jewels belonged to Russia's ruling Romanov family,
overthrown by the communists.
</P>
<P>
   After Hittner refused to stop the tour, the Magness family
pressed on with its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Embassy spokesman Mikhail A. Shurgalin and Tim
Dickinson, a Washington, D.C., attorney who also represented
Russia, could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The award increases by an estimated $31,000 in interest per day,
and Magness family attorney Daniel B. Nelson believes there is a
way for his clients to collect.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has declined to say what his strategy will be.
</P>
<P>
   Hittner also awarded Lee Magness $400,000 for the two pianos.

UNDATED: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Charnin compares the current generation of entrepreneurs to
an earlier wave of young plutocrats, including Ms. McFadden, who
journeyed to India in the 70s and also brought back clothes and
goods for their friends and select stores. ``Those women had the
finances and the wherewithal to get around,'' she said. ``If you
were just some hippie girl, you might have been swallowed up by the
place.''
</P>
<P>
   No such fate is likely to befall Ms. Fraysse, who is nothing if
not resourceful. She travels from village to village in a beat-up
Ambassador, swathed to the ankles in traditional Indian garb and
wearing a scarf ``to cover the parts that shouldn't be seen,'' she
said. She spends about $12 nightly on lodging. She works with
village craftsmen, sitting side by side with them in sweltering
tin-roofed sheds. She communicates, when all else fails, by waving
her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I want the men to loosen up a certain pattern, I trace
the shape of a mountain or some other soft image,'' she said. ``I
just try to be as visually expressive as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Her dedication is fed partly by the noblesse oblige that dates
to colonial times. ``Designing in India traditionally has been a
lady's occupation,'' said Richard Martin, curator of the Costume
Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``It has a certain
do-goodism about it: the ability to serve a social purpose and
esthetic commerce at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fraysse works with Datskar, an association of self-employed
women whom she commissions to do embroidery. She said that the
organization enables women to earn good wages and gain self-esteem.
``I'm given so much on a human level every day that I'm in India
that I find it only normal to put something back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Francesca Amfitheatrof, a London-based designer who works in
India, said, ``Setting up a workshop and teaching people what I do
_ I think about doing that at some point.'' But Ms. Amfitheatrof,
who designed the jewelry for Fendi's fall 1999 collection and sells
her gold rings and pastel-colored beads to about 25 stores
worldwide, isn't entirely an altruist. As a girl, she lived like a
nomad, following her father, Erik Amfitheatrof, a foreign
correspondent for Time magazine, to such far-flung destinations as
Moscow and Rome. ``My upbringing was so adventurous, I would like
my adulthood to be as incredible, but in a different way,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Amfitheatrof, 30, travels to Jaipur three or four times a
year, subsidizing her expeditions with her earnings _ a sum that
she put, somewhat vaguely, at under $1 million a year. But she said
that profits are secondary to the thrill she gets from working with
gem cutters at the fabled Gem Palace in Jaipur, India's largest
gemstone workshop and market, which has drawn shoppers like Goldie
Hawn and Diana, the Princess of Wales. Sitting on the floor at the
workmen's elbow, Ms. Amfitheatrof oversees the execution of her
designs, including gold rings and unfaceted tourmaline, citrine and
smoky topaz stones that she turns into luminous beads.
</P>
<P>
   The work tends to be improvised. ``There are about 20 cutters,
and they have this huge chest of drawers full of rocks,'' she said.
``The head of the workshop will pull one out, hold it to the light
and say, `You can get this or that shape out of it,' and the cutter
starts cutting it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then a little man comes and takes the stones away. He cycles
20 kilometers to his workshop and drills them, and brings them
back. Some have been drilled properly, and some haven't. That's
part of the charm, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Taillac, another Gem Palace devotee, works with peridot,
bright turquoise and other pastel stones. ``I might spend an entire
day making nothing but pink necklaces,'' she said. ``I think I'm
quite eccentric at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Westerners would think of running a business as casually and
erratically as Ms. de Taillac and her fellow travelers. Nor would
most willingly subsist on an income that scarcely covers their
expenses. Ms. Fraysse said she put all her earnings back into her
business. ``Everything I have and own is in what I make,'' she
said. ``This bank account of mine, sometimes it's full, sometimes
it's empty. I guess I'm running at a risk, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   When monsoons, unreliable transportation and an unpredictable
labor force threaten to make hash of production and delivery
schedules, these entrepreneurs cultivate a kind of balmy fatalism.
Ms. de Taillac laughed at the memory of the day she charged into
work, desperate to meet a deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``My craftsmen had already arrived, but not one of them lifted a
finger,'' she recalled. ``They just sat there all day long, saying
prayers for their tools. I had learned too late that it was a
special holiday. Patience is key _ that, and a readiness for the
unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``In India, everything is possible. I could have my samples made
in two days, or not at all. That's what makes this life so
interesting and challenging. What doesn't get made doesn't get
made. I don't get upset anymore. Why should I? I have only myself
to look after.''

 &HT;    Lax liquor law slips by Alabama legislators
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alabama's got a tempest in a beer can.
</P>
<P>
   Putting its trust in a lobbyist at the 11th hour of its annual
session, the Alabama Legislature passed a bill that would permit
statewide Sunday alcohol sales in wet counties.
</P>
<P>
   Advocating Sunday sales wasn't his intent, said state Rep. J.E.
Turner, a Republican who represents Mobile.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Majority Leader Tom Butler (D-Madison) says Turner
apparently was duped by a lobbyist. Turner wanted to allow
19-year-old restaurant servers to be able to deliver alcoholic
drinks when ordered with a meal.
</P>
<P>
   But a subtle change in another part of the bill opened the door
for Sunday sales in counties that already permit alcohol sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the existing law, if you don't have a local law
authorizing the sale, you can't sell it'' on Sunday, said Jerry
Bassett, director of legal reference for the Alabama Legislature.
``Under the bill as it's currently before the governor, you can
sell it unless it's prohibited by local law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just changed it 180 degrees. The language is very clear.
It doesn't take an attorney to read it to see the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he ``didn't intend for it to do that. I take the
position that it doesn't do that. I guess it does but I had no
intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Alabama _ like Georgia and many other Deep South states _ lets
counties and cities determine their Sunday alcohol policies.
Mississippi prohibits Sunday sales except at resorts.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, only the largest metropolitan areas _ Montgomery,
Birmingham, Mobile and Huntsville _ permit Sunday sales.

 &HT;    Father's Day comes early for Earnhardts
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Father's Day came early for the Earnhardts
Friday at Michigan Speedway. Dale Earnhardt and his son, Dale Jr.,
raced side-by-side on the final lap, bumping fenders twice, before
dad pulled away to win his third straight IROC (International Race
of Champions) event.
</P>
<P>
   Twice before they'd been on the same track, but the race in
Japan last winter was an exhibition and three weeks ago at
Charlotte, Little E quickly fell a lap down in his Winston Cup
debut.
</P>
<P>
   This one was for real, even if it was in a 50-lap race matching
12 drivers from different types of racing in similarly-prepared
cars. Father beat son by .007 seconds. Or by a gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most unique, neatest, exciting, fun and
just everything-rolled-into-one best times I've ever had in
racing,'' papa Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Was there a chance you might let the kid win, someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Earnhardt said. ``He's going to have to earn
everything just like dad did. And I don't think he would want me to
let him win. If he went home and everybody said, `well, your dad
let you win,' that wouldn't be cool. Of course, they're going to
say, `well, your son let you win.' Bull. Look at the side of that
race car.''
</P>
<P>
   They bumped fenders at the finish. ``I came off the (fourth)
corner and he hit me pretty hard, like `you ain't gonna win it,' ''
Little E said. ``I knew if I tried to pass him and didn't make it,
I was going to get a chewing out.''
</P>
<P>
   No IRL for Petty
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to be just a little fun ride in an Indy Racing
League car but Friday Kyle Petty had to do some rumor control. He
denied he was ever going to drive one of the open-wheel cars in the
July IRL race at Atlanta Motor Speedway as has been rumored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were set up to test at Road Atlanta with the No. 43 car
(John Andretti's) and, ifwe can get it read to go, the No. 44 car
(Petty's) this coming Monday preparing for Sears Point,'' Petty
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Lingner, who's a friend of mine, is a part owner of that
Panter Racing (IRL team) and they were going to test at Atlanta
Motor Speedway on Tuesday. He asked me if I'd be interested in
staying over and driving the Indy car for a few laps. I was going
to do a few laps for fun, see what it was like, tell them thanks
and head back home. It was just a fun deal, that's it.''

 &HT;    Delta postpones deliveries of Boeing 777s
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blaming excessive pilot pay demands, Delta Air Lines
said Friday it is postponing all further deliveries of Boeing 777
widebodies and will sell or lease the two it's already flying after
the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows five months of fruitless negotiations over pay
rates for the giant jet, considered the industry's premier
international aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unfortunate development for our company,'' Chief
Executive Leo Mullin said in an employee memo. ``The 777 is a
prestigious aircraft flown by our competitors and popular with the
traveling public.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Delta, currently offering to pay 777 captains $239 an
hour, will continue talks with the pilot union, which is seeking
$319 an hour. The airline will renegotiate delivery dates with
Boeing ``if and when an agreement is ratified,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Under its original plan, Delta would have had 11 of the jets by
next summer, adding them to an international fleet now consisting
of smaller MD-11s and 767s. It was scheduled to get another two
777s in 2002, with options to buy 20 more after that.
</P>
<P>
   Even if deliveries are rescheduled, Mullin said, it would be
``at a substantially reduced pace than we had anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, which represents Delta's 9,000
pilots, suggested the real motive for Friday's action is concern
over slowing traffic growth on trans-Atlantic routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Delta pilots may be a convenient scapegoat for
management's fleet decisions, there are marketplace realities that
must be considered,'' the union said, adding ``airline analysts
have been noting for months that traffic is softening over the
North Atlantic while capacity is increasing and revenues are
down.''
</P>
<P>
   A Delta spokesman rebutted that claim, saying, ``Airlines don't
make decisions about aircraft of this magnitude on short-term
market demand.''
</P>
<P>
   ALPA also said the airline ``has shown little interest in or
commitment to reaching an agreement with pilots.'' It said Delta
``has spent the majority of the negotiating period issuing
ultimatums about the 777 fleet'' rather than bargaining in good
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it was forced to take the action now because of
scheduling issues. The pilot union has vowed to invoke its
contractual right to stop flying 777s on Nov. 1, six months after
the first plane entered use, unless a ratified pay rate is in
place.
</P>
<P>
   That creates too much uncertainty for the airline to add the
plane to fall and winter schedules, now being formulated, Delta
said. If the airline continued to take 777 deliveries, it said,
such a grounding would cause service disruptions and cost millions
as the planes sat unused.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side argues that 777 pilots should be the best-paid at
Delta, owing to the plane's newness and size.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said its offer would pay 777 captains $223,385 in base
salary, based on a typical 78-hour month. That's 5 percent above
the existing rate at American and 25 percent above the rate at
United. The pilot union's demand equates to $298,546, or nearly 40
percent above American's rates, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   ALPA has said its pay demand is calculated on the 777's
``productivity and efficiency.'' But Delta contends it wouldn't get
an adequate return on investment in the $108 million jets at the
rates ALPA is demanding.
</P>
<P>
   While only a few dozen pilots would be assigned to the planes
over the next several months, the ripple effect from their
promotions would have pushed many others into higher-paying
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ALPA cut its demand about 8 percent last month, while Delta has
raised its initial offer only 1 percent since February. It also had
announced a first wave of order deferrals in April, when it
indefinitely postponed four deliveries scheduled for early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side had made any new proposals in the last two
negotiating sessions. Another session is scheduled Tuesday, and a
breakthrough might yet allow Delta to salvage the purchase
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But if the impasse continues through the summer, 777 pay could
be incorporated into new contract talks that start in September. In
addition, the airline faces impending talks on another new
airplane, the 767-400, scheduled for delivery about a year from
now.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber analyst Samuel Buttrick said the lack of 777s hurts
Delta's service reputation, especially among frequent
trans-Atlantic fliers with a choice between carriers that fly the
plane and those that don't.
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted a deal will eventually be reached and the
orders will be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta wants to fly the triple-seven,'' Buttrick said. ``Pilots
want to fly it. Customers want to fly it. It will be flown. It's a
matter of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta's stock closed down 25 cents Friday at $57.

DEMS CRY FOUL OVER DELAY IN SENATE ACTION ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
BEST BUDDIES? 
NOW HEAR THIS 
ERODING COASTAL LAW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah)  (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers) (rk) 
 By CARL HULSE AND SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With 24 high-priority vacancies on the federal
bench, Senate Democrats say Republicans are playing politics with
judicial nominations, holding them hostage to score some points or
move their own picks forward.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, there are four so-called judicial emergencies,
vacancies that have existed for at least 18 months. The Southern
District of Alabama, the Middle District of Florida, the Northern
District of Georgia and the Eastern District of North Carolina each
have one such vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   Another 18 judicial nominations are also pending before the
Senate Judiciary Committee, but those are for more recent
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of North Carolina are entitled to a federal court
system that isn't clogged with backlogs that delay justice in
criminal and civil cases,'' said Sen. John Edwards, a freshman
Democrat from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   While Edwards did not criticize his Republican colleagues, other
Democrats are angry with Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, saying the GOP
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee is stalling judicial
nominations because the White House won't nominate a conservative
Republican friend to the federal bench in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that in many cases, the White House has been
slow to nominate candidates to the bench. A spokeswoman for the
Judiciary Committee said that a hearing has been set for Wednesday
to consider some nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina vacancy has a unique wrinkle. By tradition,
both senators must sign off on a home-state nominee before the
Judiciary Committee will act on the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Jesse Helms is, so far, withholding his support
for Judge J. Rich Leonard of Raleigh, nominated in March to served
on the Eastern District. An aide to Helms said the senator has
``nothing against'' Leonard, but Helms wants to shift a federal
judgeship from eastern North Carolina to the Western District in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Said Edwards: ``That would simply be robbing Peter to pay
Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST BUDDIES?
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Louisiana's Republican leaders were campaigning
against him. Now, they're throwing parties for him on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The newest member of Congress, Republican David Vitter of
Louisiana, found out that there's nothing like victory to foster
friendships. Vitter just won election to Louisiana's 1st
Congressional District, which was vacated by the retirement of Bob
Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, dean of the Louisiana delegation,
threw a reception for Vitter his first day in office despite the
fact that Tauzin and most of the state's Republican establishment
supported Vitter's Republican opponent, David Treen, in Louisiana's
unique open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin laughed off the irony. ``That's our history,'' Tauzin
said with a smile. ``When the election's over, it's over. Now we
close ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW HEAR THIS
</P>
<P>
   With a meager six-vote margin in the House, Republicans simply
can't afford too much dissension within their ranks if they expect
to accomplish much this year.
</P>
<P>
   So House Speaker Dennis Hastert met with GOP members recently to
tell them that while debate is welcome and healthy, they better
fall in line once it's time to vote. Many conservatives had been
blocking appropriations bills, complaining that Republicans are
violating their own once-sacred spending limits. Moderates,
meanwhile, are unhappy with their party leaders for weakening
proposed gun safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who is close to Hastert, applauded the
speaker's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most members of our conference understand that to get anything
done, we need to stick together as a team,'' Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., who sided with conservatives during the
recent budget dispute, agreed. But she warned that Republicans must
not sacrifice their fiscal principles for the sake of expediency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, we're just like everybody else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ERODING COASTAL LAW
</P>
<P>
   An environmental group that monitors coastal issues accused
House Republicans of watering down a measure intended to slow
beachfront development.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of strengthening the coastal barrier resources system,
critics said an emerging measure that renews the program removes
property from the system, making the land eligible for federal
flood insurance and other government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers intent on turning coastlines into condos are lining
up to strip acres from the system,'' said Steve Ellis of Coast
Alliance, who complained Congress has been steadily eroding the
system's holdings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal adopted by the House Resources Committee would
remove parcels on Cape Hatteras, N.C., and Upper Captiva Island,
Fla., from the system. Backers of the bill said the land is already
developed and should never have been included in the program in the
first place.

 &HT;    Meeting in New Orleans, mayors push tough gun laws
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Congress should pass legislation requiring much
tighter restrictions on guns, including raising the age for
possession of a gun from 18 to 21 and requiring background checks
for buyers at gun shows, the U.S. Conference of Mayors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors proposed the legislation _ which goes further than
any bills being considered by Congress _ in a letter to U.S. House
Speaker Dennis Hastert. The letter will be signed by the 300 mayors
attending the conference here and sent to Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are saying to Republicans and Democrats that we want a
meaningful bill with teeth,'' said New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has been debating bills designed to restrict access to
guns and increase gun safety in response to the fatal shootings at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., in April.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed by the Senate is stuck in the House because it is
seen by many legislators as too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   The mayors' letter asks Congress to approve legislation that:
</P>
<P>
   _ allows a maximum of one gun purchase a month;
</P>
<P>
   _ reinstates the ``cooling-off'' period between the time of
purchase and possession of a gun;
</P>
<P>
   _ provides ``substantial'' funding for the development of
personalized ``smart'' guns, which only the owner can use;
</P>
<P>
   _ requires a background check for purchases at gun shows;
</P>
<P>
   _ raises the age for purchasing and owning a gun to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Pressuring Congress is one part of what Morial called a
``multi-front movement'' to reduce the incidence of gun-related
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Another important element is litigation: Twenty cities,
including Atlanta and New Orleans, have filed lawsuits against the
gun manufacturers and sellers. The suits allege that the industry
failed to make a safe product by not putting locks and other safety
devices on guns.
</P>
<P>
   Several states, including Georgia and Louisiana, have passed
laws making such lawsuits illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Morial said he is not worried about his city's suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bill that seeks to nullify an already-filed lawsuit is
headed for a swift constitutional death in the courts,'' he said.
``We will not be deterred.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayors _ some Republicans, some Democrats _ expressed
frustration and even outrage at the Republican-controlled Congress
for hesitating to pass stricter gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ridiculous,'' said Mayor Scott King of Gary, Ind. ``I
have buried a 2-year-old and I have buried a police officer and I
watch maimed and crippled people every day. Enough is enough.''

 &HT;    CARE workers prepare to enter Kosovo
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A five-person team of CARE workers may enter Kosovo as
early as Sunday to assess the needs and dangers in the bombed and
burned-out Yugoslav province, and to determine the best way to help
refugees returning from other countries as well as Kosovars who
have been hiding in the hills with little to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Many challenges await relief workers entering the province _ the
danger of land mines and unexploded bombs, a lack of knowledge
about the number and the condition of internally displaced
Kosovars, and uncertainty over whether Kosovars now in refugee
camps will return in an organized fashion or a mad rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rapidly unfolding situation that will undoubtedly
take unexpected twists and turns,'' said Peter Bell, the president
of Atlanta-based CARE USA.
</P>
<P>
   CARE expects to be providing aid to 150,000 people in its first
month of operation in Kosovo, and the number may swell to 250,000
within a couple of months after that, Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   For the purpose of organizing the delivery of humanitarian aid,
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has divided Kosovo into
seven sectors. CARE will operate in the Urosevac area in the
southeastern part of the province, adjacent to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Glocker, a spokesman for CARE USA, said six different
CARE organizations will participate in the effort _ those from
Canada, Austria, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the different organizations are coordinated by
Brussels-based CARE International, a confederation of all 10
national CARE organizations. CARE International has named Marge
Tsitouris, a CARE USA official based in Atlanta, Balkans
coordinator for the international effort; the different national
CARE operations will report to her in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's immediate priority, Bell said, is to acquire the
necessary equipment _ trucks, fork lifts, computers, and the like _
to run what he called ``a fairly complex logistical operation.''
Aid workers' initial efforts will be to provide the refugees with
food, sanitation, temporary shelter such as tents, and building
materials, he said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE's preference will be to house people in tents next to their
damaged houses rather than to create new camps inside the province,
though anything is possible once the situation is assessed, said
Robert Macpherson, a CARE USA official.
</P>
<P>
   Macpherson, a retired colonel with 25 years service in the
Marines, plans to leave Atlanta Monday for Macedonia. He will lead
a team of about 25 people into Kosovo next week to further assess
the dangers _ and to begin setting up the relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to assess this thing to death,'' Macpherson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Macpherson said he is worried not only about land mines, but
about unexploded bombs, thousands of which he assumes are lying
about, and the possibility of numerous wells having been poisoned
as part of the campaign against the Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Macpherson was in Kosovo before the bombing began, and he said
the province's infrastructure then was very good. But his team will
have to assess how badly roads and bridges have been damaged, and
how difficult it is now to move equipment and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that CARE estimates it will need $2.5 million to pay
for the first two months of the operation, excluding food and
supplies. So far the organization has designated $700,000 of the
$3.8 million it received for the Balkan crisis from the American
public _ individuals, foundations, and corporations _ for
operations in Kosovo itself. And the CARE board has approved using
and additional $800,000 from an emergency fund. But that still
leaves the organization $1 million short for the moment, he said.

 &HT;    EPA's new fuel standards hailed
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A parade of private citizens, environmentalists and
scientists told U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials
Friday they are pleased with a federal proposal to make gasoline
cleaner and to sharply cut the pollution from sports utility
vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile manufacturers said they will need more time than what
the EPA would allow to make their vehicles cleaner. Officials with
the oil and gas industries said the whole proposal should be put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 people testified Friday at the all-day hearing in
Atlanta on EPA's proposed new standards, which are designed to
reduce smog levels in metro Atlanta and dozens of other urban
areas. Among other things, the new rules would force gasoline
producers to remove 90 percent of the sulfur currently found in the
fuel. Sulfur damages an automobile's pollution-control equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without cleaner fuel, you can't expect car companies to
deliver cleaner cars,'' said Margo Oge, head of the EPA's Office of
Mobile Sources.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations also would require car makers to cut
tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxides, or NOX, by 77 percent in new
passenger cars. A fourth of the cars produced by a manufacturer
would have to meet the standard by 2004 by installing new
pollution-control devices on the vehicles. All new cars would have
to meet it by 2007. NOX is a main ingredient in the formation of
ground-level ozone.
</P>
<P>
   For SUVs, minivans and pickup trucks, which are now subject to
weaker standards than those for passenger cars, the rules would be
even more stringent. Light-duty trucks and SUVs _ those weighing
less than 6,000 pounds _ would have to be as much as 95 percent
cleaner by 2004, and, for the first time, they would have the same
exhaust system requirements as passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs, minivans and pickups now make up nearly half of all
passenger vehicles sold in metro Atlanta and typically emit three
to five times as much pollution as cars. The EPA would give
manufacturers of heavy-duty vehicles weighing 6,000 to 8,500 until
2009 to meet the standards. Those vehicles include the Ford
Expedition, the Dodge Ram and the Lincoln Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, EPA estimates that the new standards would add
about $100 to the cost of a new car and up to $200 for a light
truck. Consumers would pay less than 2 cents per gallon for the
low-sulfur gasoline, officials projected.
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers at the hearing said it was about time that SUVs,
minivans and pickup trucks be subjected to the same emission
standards as cars and objected to the heavier vehicles being given
extra time to meet the standards. But Josephine Cooper, speaking
for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said automakers
``need enough flexibility ... to allow the invention of the
technologies necessary to make EPA's standards a reality. Getting
there will take time and require us to clear a number of
technological hurdles.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as a birthday party for the former Yankee pitcher David
Wells and his best friend, the restaurateur Noel Ashman, was coming
into full swing at Veruka on Wednesday night, the guests of honor
were nowhere near the SoHo nightspot. They were stuck in Flushing,
Queens, awaiting the outcome of a deadlocked baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, pitching for the Toronto Blue Jays, was a strike away
from closing out a 3-0 victory against the New York Mets when his
birthday went south. The home team rallied, sending the game into
extra innings. Ashman, Veruka's owner, grew more frantic in his
field-level seat at Shea Stadium. He phoned Wass, his doorman, and
went over the guest list, making sure that VIP's who had RSVP'd,
like Penny Marshall and Sarah Jessica Parker, would get in and
dictating the names of those who would have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wanted to torture me, this would be a good way to
do it,'' he said. ``You're having this great birthday party and you
can't even get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The party marked a return to New York nightlife for Wells, who
during his Yankee years was known for his 91-mile-an-hour pitching
heat and faster barroom-brawling social life. They look like
unlikely buddies. Wells, a towering, 250-pounder from San Diego, is
a hard drinker with a passion for Harleys, Babe Ruth memorabilia
and tattoos of his children's faces. Ashman is a soft-spoken,
boyish 5-foot-9 Upper East Sider. He played a Henry Higgins role,
fine-tuning the rambunctious athlete's taste for the high life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to all the wrong places,'' said Ashman, who
turned Wells from stripper bars to the club demimonde of models,
rock stars and Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:15, Ashman was pacing the Diamond Club bar in his black
suede Adidas, keeping an eye on the game and his ear to his Nokia.
``Lorne Michaels is there,'' he said with frustration. ``Ione Skye,
Alex Von Furstenberg, Shoshanna Lonstein, Donovan Leitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaning on the bar, he relayed the play-by-play of his agonizing
split-screen night. At Veruka, on Broome Street, Samantha Ronson's
band was making its rocking debut in the downstairs room. At Shea,
neither team could buy a hit. Fashion models were blowing
over-the-phone kisses to Ashman. In the cheesy Mets bar, the
televisions were on the fritz.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:15 a.m., when the Mets scored at last in the bottom of the
14th, breaking the tie, Blue Jay wives and friends traded relieved
high-fives. ``Kato Kaelin's there?'' Ashman said into the phone.
They cheered when Wells, having skipped his press interviews,
arrived at the Diamond Club in a black T-shirt and khakis, his
short, thinning hair gelled into a spiky crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pitched a great game, Dave,'' Ashman said consolingly in
the stretch limo speeding toward Manhattan. Wells grimaced, upset
about his blown shutout and about being a straggler at his own
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the last of the Mohicans,'' he grumbled. Crossing the
Williamsburg Bridge, Ashman gave instructions via Nokia to have a
bottle of Ketel One vodka and Wells' favorite heavy metal ready.
``Play AC/DC,'' he instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, play Bob Marley,'' Wells said unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the crush at Veruka after 1 a.m., the birthday boys
squeezed into their VIP booth, greeting Michaels and other friends
who had waited to say hello before saying goodbye. Von Furstenberg
rushed over for a hug before heading home. By all accounts, the
party had peaked an hour earlier, but Wells helped keep it alive
until dawn.
</P>
<P>
   A yardlong white birthday cake floated into view. Wells, who has
turned 36, and Ashman, soon to be 29, leaned forward to blow out
the candles. Then Wells took a swig of his screwdriver and started
playing air drums to ``Highway to Hell.''

 &HT;    Gordon wins pole in Michigan
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ A ``trying year'' for Jeff Gordon got a little
bit better Friday at Michigan Speedway. He won the pole for
Sunday's KMart 400 with a track-record lap of 186.945 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It's Gordon's 27th career Winston Cup pole, fourth this season
and second straight at the two-mile track. He'll start up front
with some surprising running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan had a season-best qualifying run, 186.712 mph, and
will start on the outside pole. Mark Martin and Ken Schrader were
third and fourth, respectively, and Bill Elliott ripped off his
best qualifying effort of the year (186.543 mph) to start fifth.
</P>
<P>
   What Gordon considers a trying year would delight the majority
of Cup drivers: three wins, seven top fives, sixth in the points
race and a $1 million bonus for winning one of the Winston No Bull
5 events.
</P>
<P>
   But the standards of a three-time Winston Cup champion are
understandably higher than the majority. He's also experienced some
un-Gordonlike calamaties: four DNFs (did not finish), five finishes
of 31st or worse, the first injury crash of his career at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been a trying year for us a little bit,''
Gordon said. ``When you have the type of success we've had the last
few years there's a lot of pressure on you to live up to those
expectations. We came out of the box in Daytona with an awesome win
and said, man, we're going to start off where we left off. Well,
that quickly turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned around with a succession of what Gordon calls ``kind
of crazy things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A blown motor, cut tires, power steering pump seal go out,
things that rarely happened to us the last few years are happening
to us this year,'' Gordon said. ``It's just the way racing goes.
When you have the type of year we had last year, when it seemed
like we couldn't do anything wrong, you know that those times are
going to come back and they certainly have.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crazy thing happened last week at Dover. Gordon was
leading with six laps to go but had to pit for fuel and lost to
Bobby Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   And while Gordon believes that things happen for a reason (``If
it's our year to win the championship, then things will start going
our way'') he also realizes his team probably can't afford another
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically have no more opportunities left to have problems
and the other guys will have to have a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Stanley Cup finals: 'It's a war'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ What was expected to be a Stanley Cup final
short on goals and long on yawns at the blue line has been
saturated with threats, mudslinging and injury reports seemingly
put out by the secret service.
</P>
<P>
   Well. Couldn't hurt the TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   When Dallas and Buffalo resume the Stanley Cup finals this
evening, with the series tied at one game each, the Stars may be
without their best player, center Mike Modano. It's also possible
Modano will start. It's also possible his next game will be in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Modano either did or didn't suffer a fractured left wrist when
he was crunched into the boards by the Sabres' Jay McKee in the
third period of Dallas's 4-2 win Thursday night. Dallas coach Ken
Hitchcock said only that his player's wrist was ``jammed,'' and
that his status was day-to-day. He would not comment when asked if
there was a fracture, as reported by ESPN, and NHL spokesman Frank
Brown said Hitchcock, ``has fulfilled his obligation'' in
disclosing the injury, even if the disclosure was somewhat vague.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the worst-case scenario has Modano out for seven
to 10 days, which could be the duration of the finals, but added,
``We think he's a player'' tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Now it gets interesting. The Sabres, upset because they beleive
the Stars have been taking intentional runs at goalie Dominik
Hasek, declared ``open season'' (coach Lindy Ruff's words) on
Dallas goalie Ed Belfour. At least one Buffalo player also
indicated Modano _ specifically, his left wrist _ would be targeted
if he does play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd be foolish not to,'' center Michael Peca said.
``I don't think we'd have anybody take a two-hand chop. But you
want to make sure you're physical with him. Maybe you bump him.
Certainly if there's a weakness, you want to exploit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano's response: ``Whether I'm hurt or not, I'm still
targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's threat: ``Mike's our best player. If they go after
our best player, we'll go after their best player. Tit for tat.
Their best player is Hasek.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Ruff picks it up. He said he ``wouldn't want'' his
players taking an intentional run at Belfour, then made a U-turn:
``We're talking about the big prize. You do what you have to do to
win. Hitch is going to be the same way. What's fair? Fair is the
weather in Buffalo in March or April.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Our team will protect our goaltender in the same way
they're going to protect theirs. But if they take liberties, I
won't be able to control my players. Right now it's an eye for an
eye. It's a war. You do anything to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock returns: ``That's good. Eddie can take care of
himself. He's a tough guy. And if we get going exchanging
goaltenders, we've got lots of good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   McKee chimes in: ``We're going to drive the net hard. If we feel
guys are intentionally running over Dominic, I guess we'll drive
the net harder and if we get hauled down we'll end up going through
Belfour.''
</P>
<P>
   If Modano doesn't play, he likely will be replaced on the Stars'
top line by Tony Hrkac, who would center Brett Hull and Jere
Lehtenin. ``The thing we can't do is let down if Modano's not
there,'' Peca said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem possible.

AN ALL-STAR TICKET SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buyer beware. That's the message coming from those people who
think they have deals to get tickets for the Major League All-Star
Game at Fenway Park in July.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people around here were scammed on tickets when the
Patriots made their last Super Bowl trip, and more will get skunked
on the All-Star Game. A friend told me Friday that a business
associate just paid $10,000 for four tickets. I told him that was
interesting, since the tickets haven't been issued yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been told that tickets are selling on the Internet for
$3,000 and $4,000 each,'' said Kevin Shea of the Red Sox. ``We want
to point out that it is illegal to re-sell an All-Star Game ticket.
The only tickets around here are going to season ticket-holders,
and they are not supposed to be resold.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is: Don't give anyone money in advance for the
tickets, or you may never see the money again. There has never been
a ticket as hard to get as this All-Star ticket. Imagine, the face
value of the ticket is $150 for a box seat, $100 for the
grandstand, and $50 for the bleachers, and people are ready to
spend at least 25 times that much.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a Boston businessman called and said he and some
friends had a chance to by six tickets to the Super Bowl for $1,500
from a contact in Ohio. The Ohio seller claimed to have a
connection to an NFL assistant coach. I called the team, and the
coach said he had never heard of the seller and certainly wasn't
going to get him Super Bowl tickets. The whole thing was a sting.
The Ohio guy wanted the check in November, but the tickets weren't
even going to be distributed until January. No one has All-Star
Game tickets yet. Not even the Red Sox. And no one can guarantee
anything until the tickets are in hand. Last year, the Red Sox
pulled the season tickets of some fans when it was discovered they
were selling some of their tickets. They will do the same to any
ticket-holder who is found selling the All-Star Game tickets.

<P>
   Celtics coach Rick Pitino has been appointed to a new committee
to study point scoring in the NBA by commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stern is very concerned and upset by what is happening,'' said
Pitino, who will serve with a dozen other league coaches, general
managers, and owners to find a way to get the game back to higher
scoring levels. ``He wants the games to go back to both teams
scoring more than 100 points each. To get that, I think we have to
develop some defensive guidelines. Players are getting away with
murder on defense, and this is detroying the flow of the offense
and the ability to score points. The game has become too physical.
Even on the most simple play, like a pick and roll, the defensive
player is just using his forearm to push the offensive player
around. This has all slowed the game down and made it a halfcourt
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as fast, or exciting to watch, as a game with more
speed and plays in the open court. When I coached the Knicks, we
averaged 117 points a game, and 28 or 29 (fast-break
opportunities). This year with the Celtics, we averaged about 18.
We've got to take away some of the things the defense is doing.
Some guys are averaging 40 percent (shooting) from the floor. It
should be up around 48. When McHale and Parish were playing, they
both averaged 55 percent, and Bird was just under 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino feels the clutch-and-grab tactics that are being
permitted don't allow for big offensive explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grabbing and holding throws the timing of the offense
away,'' he said. ``It takes eight seconds to get the ball over
halfcourt, on average. Then it takes another 12 seconds to run the
play and try to set up the shot you want. If the timing is
destroyed, you run out of time, someone has to go one on one and
try to get off a shot before the buzzer. We've got to get the game
back to where these players can make plays in the open court and
make the game more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``maul-ball'' type of play dates back to the Detroit Pistons
of Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, etc., who won two
titles by getting away with murder on the defensive end. This was
the start of the so-called ``Jordan Rules,'' in which the Pistons
found the best way to stop Michael was to hold him and never let
him use the screen to get away the shot. The problem is that the
Jordan rules are still in effect for anyone who has any kind of
offensive game: Clutch and grab him so he can't get free to get
some space. The Knicks have done it to Reggie Miller throughout the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This from a Toronto publication earlier this season: ``Roger
(Clemens) didn't want to be here, didn't think we could contend,''
said Blue Jay pitcher Pat Hentgen. ``And there are 24 Blue Jay
players here who didn't want him to stay.'' ... Credit Patriots
coach Pete Carroll for pushing Chris Canty out the door and helping
the Patriots cut their losses. Carroll didn't want Canty in the
first place. Canty's agent is calling other teams, who are calling
around to find out why a team would waive its first-round draft
choice after just two years
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I wish Connecticut would stop whining about suing the Patriots
and the NFL. The state officials are the ones to blame. When you
offer someone the greatest deal in the history of sports to move
and don't make it binding, and leave him five different ways to get
out, then you lose. It's your fault. But Connecticut left the
loopholes in and is now crying about the Patriots using them to
come back to Foxborough.

 &HT;    Georgia researchers target tropical diseases
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ They resemble stink bugs, but instead of eating
plants, Reduviid bugs suck the blood of humans and animals, then
leave behind a plop of feces.
</P>
<P>
   They can also leave a lifetime of problems _ their waste can
contain a protozoan parasite that causes a fatal heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated 20 million people, mostly in Latin
America, already infected with the parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi will
die of complications from an enlarged heart produced by Chagas
disease. Charles Darwin was said to have suffered from the
debilitating, incurable illness.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular biologists at the University of Georgia are hoping to
find a cure for Chagas disease and other parasitic infections that
are major sources of plant, animal and human illness and deaths.
Parasitic infections account for millions of lost dollars and lives
_ malaria, associated with mosquitoes, alone accounts for 3 million
deaths annually, mostly of children.
</P>
<P>
   Formed last fall, the UGA Center for Tropical and Emerging
Global Diseases draws its researchers from UGA's College of
Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, College of Veterinary
Medicine and Franklin College of Arts and Sciences. The UGA College
of Pharmacy is also expected to become involved, and two other
faculty positions will be filled by scientists associated with the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Adjunct faculty are scattered at Emory University's Vaccine
Center in Atlanta, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta, and the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Research Alliance is helping with the start-up of
the associated Laboratory for Technology Development, which will
bring to the commercial market any developments from the center's
research, such as vaccines. UGA officials hope to work with the
Georgia Research Alliance to build facilities for the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We developed the center to strengthen UGA's strong program in
parasitology,'' said director Rick Tarleton, a cellular biologist
who has been studying T. cruzi since he was an undergraduate at
Wake Forest. ``Also, we wanted to become more competitive for
program project grants, which are given to collaborative efforts
instead of individual researchers.''
</P>
<P>
   One scientist is exploring ways to manipulate the genes of
Reduviid bugs to make them incapable of carrying T. cruzi , while
another is analyzing the bug's saliva, which prevents blood from
clotting.
</P>
<P>
   Tarleton and his graduate students are trying to understand the
response of the immune system to the parasite and to determine how
that response can be amplified by vaccination to increase the odds
against the development of Chagas disease. He is also trying to
understand why the disease occurs in only 30 to 40 percent of
infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Although infectious diseases occur primarily in less developed
countries, they are on the rise in the United States, Tarleton
said. Witness in the last few years the outbreak of diarrhea and
death in Milwaukee, caused by cryptosporidia in the water system,
and 21 clusters of cases reported to the CDC in 1997, most of them
linked to cyclospora -contaminated raspberries imported from
Guatemala. With more international travel, immigrants and imports,
the number of such occurrences is likely to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Chagas disease isn't the only parasitic infection under study.
Center faculty are researching the causes and carriers of malaria,
African sleeping sickness, river blindness and leishmaniasis, which
can cause fever, weight loss, enlargement of the spleen and anemia
_ and which, if left untreated, is fatal.
</P>
<P>
   The center has received a $3.4 million grant from the National
Insitutes of Health. Over the next five years, the money will fund
four separate projects, all related to developing a vaccine for
Chagas disease.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the grant will fund collaborative work with scientists
in Argentina. Tarleton has traveled three times to Buenos Aires
with graduate students to do research, and Argentinian scientists
from there have come to Athens for training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we study infected mice. There, we study infected
people,'' said Tarleton. ``It's different when a human face is
attached to the disease. What's an interesting biological question
here becomes in Argentina a human, personal tragedy.''

BANK OF AMERICA WILL STOP GIVING CUSTOMER DATA TO OUTSIDE
MARKETERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn.)   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid heightened concern about consumer privacy issues, Bank of
America, one of the nation's largest banks, said Friday that it
would no longer share any customer information _ including
addresses, telephone numbers and credit card account numbers _ with
outside vendors such as telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a day after U.S. Bancorp, a large Minneapolis
bank, ended relationships with several telemarketing companies that
solicit its customers to buy a variety of nonfinancial products.
Earlier in the week, the Minnesota attorney general's office sued
U.S. Bancorp, contending that the bank illegally sold credit
histories and other customer information to a large telemarketer,
even though it told customers it did not engage in such practices.
U.S. Bancorp disputes that its practices were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   As personal information continues to flow loosely across
telephone lines and through the vast reaches of the Internet, and
has become a lucrative trade for companies like banks with ready
access to the data, federal and state regulators have begun to
crack down on abuses tied to information trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Banks frequently provide birth dates, Social Security numbers,
checking and credit card account information, addresses and
telephone numbers to outside companies for hefty fees or
commissions. But there has been a proliferation of complaints from
consumers recently about telemarketing practices that include
charging a customer's credit card or withdrawing money from a
checking account when consumers believe they have not given
approval to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, consumer discontent about violations of financial
privacy have grown so strong that Congress took a step late
Thursday night toward circumscribing how banks do business. The
House Commerce Committee, in a bipartisan alliance, approved a
rider to financial services reform legislation that would give
consumers the right to prevent banks from sharing financial
information with their own insurance and securities affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   If the rider remains and the legislation passes it would be a
big setback for newly merged companies like Citigroup that are an
amalgam of banking, insurance and securities operations designed to
cross-sell a variety of products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   John Hawke, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, one of the main
federal banking regulators, has repeatedly spoken out about
incursions of financial privacy and has labeled information
trafficking as ``seamy.'' Friday, the Comptroller's office said it
welcomed Bank of America's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bank of America had previously advised us that it was
reconsidering its policies and we commend the bank for announcing
these changes,'' said Julie Williams, the comptroller's chief
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America and U.S. Bancorp will not be insulating their
customers from every form of telemarketing. Both companies will
allow vendors of financial products, like insurance companies, to
keep contacting their customers, but will no longer maintain
relationships with vendors of nonfinancial products, such as
vacation packages and dining club memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is going one step further, saying that it will
not allow financial products vendors to contact customers directly.
Instead, the bank will require those companies to use Bank of
America as a middleman when pitching their products. Bank of
America said a curtailed relationship with telemarketers would harm
the bank's profitability.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp said its move came in response to the Minnesota
attorney general's suit and to more than 800 complaints it received
from customers about its relationships with telemarketers. The bank
said it ended its relationship with four telemarketing companies:
Branddirect, Damark, Health Benefits Services and Memberworks.
Memberworks, cited for abusive practices in the Minnesota attorney
general's suit, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Corp. of Chicago said it only shared customer phone
numbers and addresses with outside vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. and Citigroup declined to comment on
exactly what customer information they shared with outside vendors.

PEACEKEEPERS TO `HOLD KOSOVO TOGETHER,' GENERAL PROMISES
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Gen. Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, told
allied ambassadors Friday that the peacekeepers who would soon
begin moving into Kosovo would try to ``hold Kosovo together''
until international aid agencies could set up relief operations
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to recognize that at first we're the only
organization that's in there,'' he said in an interview summing up
NATO's 11-week bombing campaign, which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have special responsibilities in gripping the situation,''
Clark said. NATO peacekeeping troops under the command of British
Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson are ready to provide first aid and food to
any refugees they find when they go in, he said, and to prevent
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there'll be hotheads on both sides who don't want to
let bygones be bygones,'' he said, not ruling out more organized
resistance to the peacekeeping force from Serbs or ethnic Albanian
rebels. ``We'll have to work those problems if we run into them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Clark said, the withdrawing Yugoslav forces had been
``pretty cooperative.'' The peacekeeping force delayed plans to
start moving in Friday, he said, because Yugoslav commanders had
asked for more time to get some of their heavy equipment together
and clear obstacles from the roads close to Kosovo's southern and
western borders.
</P>
<P>
   French, German and British peacekeeping troops plan to begin a
synchronized entry into Kosovo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 Yugoslav soldiers did pull out from the northern
part of Kosovo on the first day, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the allied command said that some fighting between Serb
forces and Albanian rebels continued near the Albanian border
Friday and a Yugoslav anti-aircraft missile radar had ``locked on''
to an allied plane, Clark said he had not been notified of any
other violations of the military withdrawal agreement by late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Like other allied officials, he said he was relaxed about
Friday's diplomatic and military maneuvering by Russia over its
possible participation in the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there'll be Russians there,'' he said. ``From a
military standpoint, I think Russia has military capacities that
could provide some significant assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and other allied leaders credited Russian
diplomatic pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for
helping isolate Serbia. Clark, who negotiated with Milosevic on the
military aspects of the peace agreement in Bosnia in 1995, agreed
that, on that level, the Russians did help.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really wasn't a war,'' he said. ``It was diplomacy backed
by force. The destruction was only a consequence of his not
complying with international will. It wasn't a sense that we were
going to move in and occupy the country.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Clark said, his first priority had been to
attack the 40,000 Yugoslav soldiers and Serbian police and
paramilitary units that were systematically driving the Kosovo
Albanians from their homes and have now finally begun to pull out
of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it took a while without a ground force to develop a
capability to go after them,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An essential part of the system that was developed, Clark said,
was Task Force Hawk, the 4,000 American troops who moved into
Albania in April with Black Hawk anti-tank helicopters that
famously never went into combat.
</P>
<P>
   The artillery-locating radar system that came with the
helicopters did go into action, he said, and was used to help
allied pilots and their targeting specialists develop new tactics
that eventually destroyed half the Yugoslav artillery and tank
forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he brought it in and fired it, we took it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had not gathered all the helicopters and planes he
needed before the bombing started last March 24, Clark said, ``We
could not have gotten all those assets at the outset. There wasn't
a consensus position that that kind of power and destruction was
going to be required.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects the value of alliance cohesion was greater
than the value of any specific target. When we started, there were
many who from a variety of motives felt it wasn't going to be that
difficult to achieve what we wanted. Some who said we should do as
little as possible because Yugoslavia was a European country, and
every bit of infrastructure we tear up, one of us will have to pay
for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we went in,'' Clark added, ``and it became clear it wasn't
going to be over in a few days or a few weeks, accelerating the
tempo became more attractive.At first, we wanted to work mostly at
night to minimize the effect of missiles and anti-aircraft fire. As
we got experience, as we took them out, we were eventually able to
fly 24 hours a day, but to do that we were going to need more
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ended, he said, with more than 900 allied planes,
three times as many as he had at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   By the time bombing was suspended, he said, these warplanes had
done tremendous damage to Milosevic's strategic military assets all
over Serbia. The allies lost not a single pilot in combat
operations in this campaign. ``A big part of our success was the
mystique of invulnerability,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   While they made their share of mistakes, causing unintended
civilian casualties in both Yugoslavia and Kosovo, Clark said they
were few, given the 23,000 bombs and missiles that were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final standard,'' he said, ``is, did it work? Did it
provide crucial leverage to diplomacy? I think yes, it did.''

<P>
   The signs have been evident for several months: top high school
seniors rejected by colleges of their choice, second-tier
institutions overwhelmed with excellent applications, state
universities raising admission requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Now, interviews with scores of college and school officials and
preliminary statistics, appear to confirm what stunned high school
seniors and their parents suspect: that the college application
season just ended was the most competitive in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   A roaring economy, a population boom, an increasingly
sophisticated education industry and the growing belief in the link
between college and personal success have raised the stakes for
acceptance to the nation's better colleges. And there is every
indication that the trend will intensify over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just never had anything like this,'' said Robert
Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research on Higher Education
at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It's a kind of college mania,
with suburban schools sending 70 to 80 percent of their students to
college. Other routes into the work force are withering. Vocational
education has been cut nearly in half. This is the wave
accompanying globalization of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The data available so far tell a compelling story. The number of
students enrolled in four-year institutions of higher education is
at an all-time high _ 14.8 million registered for this fall, up
from the record 14.6 million in fall 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children enrolled in kindergarten through 12th
grade is also at an all-time high and is expected to grow until
2008. The number of students projected to graduate from high school
this year _ 2.8 million _ falls below the record of 3.2 million in
1977 when the last baby boomers reached college age.
</P>
<P>
   However, the portion expected to go to college is up
significantly from 50 percent then to 67 percent today, according
to the National Center for Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board says the number of high school seniors taking
the SAT's has been hitting yearly records lately with a jump this
year to more than 1,300,000 from last year's 1,173,000. In 1977,
the number of SAT takers was about 980,000.
</P>
<P>
   Every year at this time, the National Association for College
Admission Counseling publishes a list in which colleges advertise
the slots left open in all their classes. This year, as in the
past, hundreds of institutions are on the list. But many of the
better-known colleges that have appeared in the past are not on the
list this year.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the pressure has been that the way applicants
groom themselves for college has taken on greater importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that people worried about having a good resume
upon leaving college,'' said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president
of the American Council on Education in Washington. ``The stakes
have now moved down the chain, with students wanting a good early
start including good high school internships to get them into
college.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately, even that approach does not seem to assure success.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew D. Lerner, who is graduating from high school in
Swampscott, Mass., this month, is seen by many of those around him
as an academic star and model college applicant.
</P>
<P>
   His SAT scores were 750 out of 800 on the verbal section, 700
out of 800 on mathematics; he took all advanced placement courses
this year and received the highest possible mark, five, on his
advanced placement calculus test.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of his school's political action club, drum
major in the high school band, religious director of his synagogue
youth group and is a published poet.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner applied to Harvard, Brown, Georgetown and Wesleyan
Universities and the honors program at the University of
Massachusetts. He was accepted only at UMass although he made the
waiting list at Wesleyan.
</P>
<P>
   ```Upset' doesn't begin to describe how I felt,'' Lerner said.
``I fell into a mild depression.''
</P>
<P>
   An array of teachers and his principal and rabbi all approached
Wesleyan to urge that he be admitted. In the end that is what
happened, but it was a piece of good luck. Wesleyan, which had a
record number of applicants, was a rarity among highly selective
colleges in taking anyone off its waiting list. Many of the most
selective colleges took no one.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The director of admissions at Brown, Michael Goldberger, said
its applicant pool for this year's entering class of 1,360 included
3,000 students scoring 750 or better on the verbal portion of the
SAT and 3,500 ranked in the top five of their graduating classes.
</P>
<P>
   John DiBiaggio, the president of Tufts University in Medford,
Mass., said it had turned away one-third of the valedictorians who
applied and a number of applicants with perfect 1,600 SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   The college received 13,500 applications for 1,200 spots and
accepted fewer than last year. Yet, more of those accepted decided
to come, and there are 90 more freshmen than beds, creating a
housing shortage for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Holyoke College is facing a similar problem with 50 more
accepted students than it has room for. So is Trinity College in
Hartford, Conn. Many other colleges _ Vanderbilt in Tennessee,
Pomona in California, Furman in South Carolina, Wabash in Indiana _
all have had record years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sea change out there,'' said Carl Bewig, director
of college counseling at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., one of
the nation's most selective preparatory academies. ``I have been in
this business for 30 years and I can't remember a time when there
has been such a shift.''
</P>
<P>
   College counselors and others who watch the admissions process
say that early in this season they detected crowding at the top
colleges, and figured it was because it is now so easy for
students, aided by computers and the Internet, to apply to lots of
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, the thirst for brand names has never been greater
and top universities have greatly increased their financial aid as
their endowments have risen with the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The theory went that at less selective institutions, there would
be far less pressure. Each student might have submitted numerous
applications but ultimately could choose only one college. Then the
other places would open up.
</P>
<P>
   That has not turned out to be the case. Colleges that a decade
ago worried about finding enough good students are now happily
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   An example is Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., which had a
record number of applicants for the fourth straight year. The
college admitted 200 fewer students than last year in order to cut
its acceptance rate to 55 percent and thus be considered more
selective by many college guides.
</P>
<P>
   Muhlenberg feels it has improved its reputation through an
aggressive building and marketing campaign. The college, like many
around the country, has invested in a new athletics complex and
student union, intending to make it a more attractive place for
prospective students, and has recruited and advertised around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of places like Muhlenberg are all the more
remarkable when considering the growing number of alternatives to
attending a private college, like online learning and for-profit
universities, and the much cheaper alternative of state
universities.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Demographers call the current generation of students either the
baby boomlet or the baby boom echo because they are the children of
the generation that bulged so markedly after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The population increase has also been fed by immigration from
Latin America and Asia and is heaviest in the South, West and
Northeast. Moreover, Americans have moved in record numbers to the
Sunbelt over the last generation. As a result, San Diego State
University, faced with a 28 percent increase in applications this
year, now requires a higher grade point average, 3.2 out of 4.0
instead of 2.5.
</P>
<P>
   There are states, like West Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana,
where there is a projected decrease in 18-year-olds because of a
drop in births in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not translated into reduced applications and
attendance at major colleges in those states. Indiana University
and the University of Kentucky have reported excellent application
pools over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's college-age population is expected to drop by 14
percent by 2008. Yet Marshall University in Huntington, W. Va.,
decided last year to increase its acceptance standards because of
the growth in its application pool. Five years ago, there were
11,000 students at the university; now there are 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our residence halls are so loaded we are putting kids up in
hotels,'' said Jim Harless, director of admissions. ``Each year,
our freshman class has increased by anywhere from 3 to 10
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The consumers of higher education have grown more sophisticated.
Today, applicants roam the World Wide Web, bargain over financial
aid and apply to colleges far beyond their immediate radius.
</P>
<P>
   The increased willingness of students to apply to colleges at
the other end of the country is a reflection of the nation's
increased prosperity. Parents have more money to spend not only on
studies but on their children's dormitories and apartments, and
colleges have far more money to offer in scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, when the economy thrives, community college
attendance goes flat, but the current trend contradicts that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Community colleges queried in Massachusetts, Iowa, Texas,
Washington state, Oregon and North Carolina all reported rises in
enrollments this year, although South Carolina and Nebraska say
applications have not increased. Part of the success of the
two-year colleges comes from increased numbers of foreigners
enrolling at them.
</P>
<P>
   Karl M. Furstenberg, dean of admissions at Dartmouth College,
said what has really struck him this year is the huge number of
students with top grades and test scores all applying to the same
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes our job harder,'' he said. ``But it forces us to
look at the intangibles, such as critical thinking. But how many
more excellent students can we turn away?''

 &HT;    You say you want a revolution? Music industry faces one with MP3
technology
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The way you buy recorded music is about to change.
</P>
<P>
   One day in the not too distant future, you will be able to sit
down at your computer and download music from your favorite artists
at competitive prices and put it on a music CD you'll make
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a just a vision from a William Gibson cyberspace
fantasy novel, but reality brought even closer to consumers by an
audio technology called MP3 and two deals made by major media
companies this week.
</P>
<P>
   This week's rollout of digital music downloads from Amazon.com
and the announcement of Cox Interactive Media's $45 million
investment in the extremely popular Web site MP3.com are the first
steps toward making music on the Web a legitimate enterprise and
easing the tension between the recording industry and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Interactive Media, a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises,
which owns Cox Newspapers and the Cox News Service, bought a 10
percent stake in MP3.com Wednesday, betting that the idea of
distributing music via the Internet, if not the technology itself,
will be a good way to make money in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Cox and MP3.com have agreed to develop Web sites incorporating
the MP3 technology. Cox Enterprises president and chief operating
officer David Easterly will join the board of MP3.com as part of
the deal. Neither MP3.com nor Cox Interacitve Media will comment on
the deal (MP3.com is in a quiet period because it has filed for an
initial public offering), but analysts believe it's a good move for
both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is a company known for placing its bets all across the
table. Cox also has a string of media interests including radio
stations and cable TV companies. Cable and radio could both gain a
great deal should MP3 technology blossom as Internet research firm
Jupiter Communications predicts it will by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about who is who in that investment relationship,'' says
Forrester Research analyst Mark Hardie. ``Cox is big in broadcast
radio, which is moving slowly to integrate interactivity into its
business and for good reason. They have yet to prove they can make
money from it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you see Cox saying is that the technology and the
distribtuion capabilities are imporant to the future of the
business. Digital music and the future of the business is critical
for radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio has always been a promotional tool for the music industy,
and in the past, even the most wildly popular radio station makes
no profit from any of the music it plays. At the same time, the
broadcast industry has demonstrated that if you put Web addresses
on the TV screen, viewers will go to their computers and visit that
site.
</P>
<P>
   The radio industry is slowly realizing the potential of Web
music downloads. They can play a song, then direct listeners to a
Web site to download music and eventually buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What radio stations want to do is prove that after they play a
song, it sells,'' Hardie says.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry watchers believe that Cox will have a calming
effect on the record industry, which has been hostile to MP3
technology, as well as mellowing MP3.com, which has often taken
shots at the major labels for not jumping on the download
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3.com has excellent traffic right now,'' says Jupiter
Communications analyst Mark Mooridian.
</P>
<P>
   However, the success of MP3.com as a Web site and a profitable
business venture depends on the company's willingness to work with
major labels to bring the big names online.
</P>
<P>
   ``When MP3.com gets a big artist like Tom Petty, they get
tremendous traffic, but so far their relationships with major
labels have been strained at best,'' Mooradian says. ``They've got
great growth potential that hasn't been realized. And the record
companies are starting to realize that MP3 is not going to go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Amazon.com rolled out the music downloads area of its
Web site Tuesday with largely positive results from both customers
and the record labels. Its success using music downloads to promote
artists and drive CD sales is showing the record industry just what
MP3 can do for business.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's product manager for music, Greg Hart, says Amazon
decided to offer free digital downloads after a trial run featuring
Sarah McLachlan in April sent advance sales of the album soaring to
the top of Amazon's music list. ``People liked to hear music they
couldn't hear anywhere else,'' Hart says, ``and it was a great way
to spur sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon worked hard to provide the ``positive user experience''
that analysts say is mandatory for the growth of the music download
industry. Currently, Amazon offers downloads for promotional
purposes only, because there are too many copyright and industry
standardization issues that haven't been resolved yet. ``We don't
think it's quite a sales format yet,'' Hart says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to focus on consumers and media experiences,'' warns
Hardie. ``It's not about a page on the Web, it's about an
environment and an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   These first forays of major media companies like Cox and Amazon
into the world of music downloads may establish a kind of detente
between MP3.com and the recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 isn't necessarily a blasphemous word in the music industry,
but for some it's still a foreign one. ``I don't really know what
it is, other than, supposedly, everybody in this business is afraid
of it,'' says teen R&AMP;B singer Monica, a correspondent on the web
site for the Grammy Awards this year who lives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I only hear people outside of the business
talking about it,'' she adds. ``As an artist, it hasn't become a
part of my day-to-day concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based LaFace Records co-president Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid
is also familiar with the talk, but less so the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't downloaded anything, or tried,'' he says. ``But I
know it's out there. And I have to tell you, I don't necessarily
feel it is as much a threat as other people. At the same time, it's
not something that I can say that I like.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's not because Reid thinks the technology might be a way
for someone to set up shop and compete with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an option,'' he contends. ``When it becomes more of
an organized and familiar business, I can see it being more of a
complement to the business. Rather than one cannibalizing the
other, I think we'll just see a tremendous growth in our
business.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a lot of work to be done before MP3, artists and
Web developers can live happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Hardie believes MP3 isn't ready for prime time just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``MP3 is just a format for downloading music,'' he says. ``It is
just an algorithm. It's a way to compress music, and it's not even
the best way. MP3 is really just the poster child for evoloution in
the distribution of music, but it's not ripe yet. It has no mass
market polish.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jupiter Communications analyst Lucas Graves says it's
time music companies learn to stop worrying and learn to love MP3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the industry focus was on how to eliminate MP3,''
he said. ``Now, like it or not, the industry has to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the record companies could stem the rampant piracy
of their product if they would embrace the new technology and use
the Internet as a marketing tool the way it uses MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every Alanis Morrisette CD that goes platinum in the
record stores, there's a massive promotion and marketing effort,''
he points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the music industry is one of the savviest
industries in the world, but they haven't spent any money in this
area. They are worried about priacy and they should be. However, if
the music industry plays its cards right, the piracy will be a
small part of the digital landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The record companies' refusal to take advantage of MP3
technology has fostered the proliferation of underground and
pirated music on the Internet, Graves believes. ``People's own
personal music collections replaced actual music product,'' he
says. ``Ironically, if the record companies had moved faster, they
might have nipped MP3 piracy in the bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, like Amazon.com, has relationships with record labels it
needs to protect. Amazon's careful courting of record labels and
Cox's alliance with MP3.com are indicators the recording industry
is slowly accepting the idea that music downloads are here to stay,
that major media companies are going to want to use them and there
could be a potential pot of gold at the end of this virtual
rainbow.

 &HT;    STANLEY CUP NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFAL0, N.Y. _ By whiffing on six power play attempts in Game
2, Dallas now has gone 15 straight power plays without scoring.
``The Sabres scored both of their goals on the power play and we
didn't score any on our six,'' said Stars forward Pat Verbeek. ``If
there's one area we need to improve on, it's special teams.'' . . .
The Sabres are 7-0 at home in the playoffs, the Stars are 5-3 on
the road. . . . The Sabres are a hot ticket in town. After
season-ticket holders and other officials were taken care of, there
were approximately only 2,000 tickets per game (or 6,000 total for
three potential home games) that went on sale to the general public
for the finals. They sold out in eight minutes. As a result,
tickets are being scalped for anywhere from $250 to $1,000. . . .
Dallas defenseman Craig Ludwig set a record for the most years (11)
between playoff goals when he scored in Game 2. The old record was
10 years, held by Johnny Bucyk (1959-69), Gordie Howe (1970-80) and
Harry Howell (1958-68).
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers interview Fraser
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Atlanta Thrashers have yet to stock their
minor-league system with players, but general manager Don Waddell
already has recalled a coach. For an interview, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Fraser, whom Waddell hired three years ago to coach the
IHL's Orlando Solar Bears, now the the Thrashers' top affiliate,
interviewed for the NHL team's head coaching vacancy Friday. Fraser
is only the third coach to have a formal interview in Atlanta,
joining former Phoenix coach Don Hay and former Edmonton coach Ron
Low. Waddell also has had informal interviews with Ted Nolan and
Mike Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell has spoken highly of Fraser before, although it was
believed he would he more in line for an assistant's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to hire an assistant right now I'm looking for
a head coach,'' Waddell said. ``Curt's a good guy, I know him well
and he's one of the bright young hockey coaches today. He's
obviously never been a head coach in the NHL before but he was an
NHL player and he's been in pro hockey for 20 years. He's down a
great job down there, so why not look at some of the better young
guys around who can grow with the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Fraser is the strongest indication yet that
Waddell has broadened his search from his original intention of
hiring only someone with NHL head coaching experience. It's also
further evidence that he is not close to reaching a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Solar Bears reached the IHL's Turner Cup finals this year
before losing to the Houston Aeros. Waddell also denied speculation
that Aeros coach Dave Tippett was a Thrashers candidate or had been
interviewed for the job.

   CALIF-LA-SUBWAY (Los Angeles) _ For a brief moment Friday
morning, the cream of the Los Angeles political establishment could
be found deep underground, doing something that residents of this
sprawling, car-crazed city hardly ever do: riding the subway. And
not just any subway, but the five spanking new stops under
Hollywood that, after two decades of striving, setbacks and
billions of dollars, have finally brought the system to just over
11 miles of underground track. By Todd S. Purdum.

MYSTERY SHROUDS SUSPECT IN STRING OF KILLINGS IN TEXAS, KENTUCKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 13) 
 
(Attn: Calif., Ky., N.M., Texas) 
 
By MIKE SNYDER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Aug. 19, 1995, a Santa Fe Railway police officer observed a
man climbing a chain-link fence onto railroad property in San
Bernardino, Calif. At the time, the area was known as a gathering
place for transients looking for a free ride on a freight car.
</P>
<P>
   The officer found a loaded pistol in a gym bag the man was
carrying. He was quick to come up with a story, telling the
skeptical officer he had found the bag in some nearby bushes. Local
police charged him with trespassing and having a loaded weapon in
public.
</P>
<P>
   The episode would become one entry on a growing list of
relatively minor crimes allegedly committed by this itinerant
Mexican national, who identified himself to authorities in
California as Pedro Angel Jaramillo.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, suspected in the
slayings of six people in Texas and one in Kentucky since the
summer of 1997. Hundreds of law-enforcement officers are trying to
find him.
</P>
<P>
   As FBI experts develop a psychological profile of
Resendez-Ramirez, their task is complicated by contradictions and
informational gaps: a history of nonviolent crime followed, police
say, by a series of savage attacks in which victims were bludgeoned
to death. A confusing tangle of aliases and disguises. An
incomplete criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real mystery man,'' said Devon Anderson, the Harris
County (Texas) prosecutor assigned to the December slaying of a
West University Place physician who authorities say is one of
Resendez-Ramirez's victims. West University Place is an enclave of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Evans, director of social psychology at the
University of Houston, said the emerging picture of
Resendez-Ramirez is of an intelligent but ``deeply disturbed'' man
who seems to feel no guilt about his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, Evans said, what might have triggered a
transformation from wandering illegal immigrant and burglar to
vicious serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not uncommon in these situations is a kind of lurking
rage that develops in people over time,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The limited information released publicly about Resendez-Ramirez
suggests a man who rides freight cars alone, committing sporadic
crimes of opportunity. Thus, Evans speculated that he may have ``no
family support system, no support system from friends _ an
itinerant person who probably has difficulty in relating to people,
is constantly rejected, and may have a terrible rage because of
something that happened in his personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Resendez-Ramirez has used at least nine
different names and four birthdates, and that he is adept at
changing his appearance. This has made it difficult for them to
track his background.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says Resendez-Ramirez is a native of Puebla, a city of
about 835,000 people 65 miles southeast of Mexico City. The various
birthdates he has provided make him either 38 or 39.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prison system records show that on Sept. 18, 1986, a
federal judge in Laredo, Texas, sentenced Jose Reyes-Resendez _ the
alias Resendez-Ramirez was using at the time _ to 18 months in
prison for falsely representing himself as a U.S. citizen. He spent
time in various federal detention centers until his release on Aug.
14, 1987, when he was turned over to immigration authorities and
deported.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, still known as Jose Reyes-Resendez, he was back
before a federal judge, this time in Missouri. He was sentenced to
30 months for illegally re-entering the country and making false
statements. Upon his release on Feb. 1, 1991, he was deported
again.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, according to prosecutor Anderson's records, he
resurfaced in Santa Fe, N.M., using the name Antonio Martinez. In
March 1992, he was convicted of residential burglary and sentenced
to three years in prison. It could not be determined how much time
he served.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, 1993, in the tiny town of Panhandle, Texas, near
Amarillo, a drifter identified as Carlos Rodriguez _ yet another
alias _ was sentenced to 29 days in jail for evading arrest.
Authorities in Carson County could not provide details of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the 1995 San Bernadino incident.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said fingerprints filed with records of each of these
cases matched those of Resendez-Ramirez. She said it is likely,
however, that there are other crimes in his past that authorities
don't yet know about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever have his complete criminal history,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the UH psychologist, said Resendez-Ramirez's use of
aliases and disguises indicates ``a certain amount of guile or
cleverness. Even though he is a lowly itinerant worker, he is not
unintelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of his alleged crimes, Evans said, also could yield
some clues about him.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have linked Resendez-Ramirez, through physical
evidence or descriptions and circumstances, to the slayings of
seven people, ranging from a Kentucky college student to a central
Texas minister and his wife. Three of the victims' cars were
stolen, and at least two of the attacks included sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   All of the crimes occurred near railroad tracks, and several
victims were attacked at night. Evans said a professional thief
would be leery of operating at night because of the likelihood of
someone being home.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently random pattern of the attacks and the killer's
choice of small, quiet communities, such as West University Place
and the little town of Weimar, Texas, may have heightened the level
of fear he is inspiring in the public, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   This anxiety was evident after 73-year-old Josephine Konvicka
was found bludgeoned to death in her bed on June 4 in Fayette
County, a month after the slayings of a minister and his wife in
nearby Weimar. Authorities said they found Resendez-Ramirez's
fingerprints in Konvicka's home and unspecified physical evidence
tying him to the slayings in Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a relatively major crime-free county,'' Fayette County
Sheriff Rick Vandel said the day after Konvicka's body was found.
``These are good, honest, God-fearing Czech and German folk who
obey the law. Naturally, because this crime has some similarities
to (the) one in Weimar, we're getting a lot of paranoid folks.''

IN RARE TALKS WITH LIBYANS, U.S. OUTLINES SANCTION VIEW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In their first official meeting in 18 years,
the United States told Libya Friday that it would not support the
complete lifting of sanctions until Libya stopped supporting
international terrorism and met other conditions required by U.N.
resolutions, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The message was delivered by A. Peter Burleigh, the U.S.
representative, to Libya's representative, Abuzed Omar Dorda, in a
meeting with Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Also present was Sir
Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative, whose government holds
views similar to the Americans, and other senior U.N. officials,
the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had called the meeting to discuss what the Security
Council requires to end the sanctions against Tripoli, which were
first imposed in 1992 and strengthened the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were intended to force Libya to hand over two
suspects charged with carrying out the bombing of Pan American
Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December
1988, killing 270 people, mostly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Libya turned over the two suspects this spring to stand trial in
a Scottish court in the Netherlands, and sanctions were suspended
on April 5. But Libya has been pressing for them to be permanently
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have maintained that Libya must
comply with other requirements imposed by the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony on Capitol Hill this week, Martin Indyk, an
assistant secretary of state, said Libya must ``end and renounce
support for all forms of terrorism, pay appropriate compensation''
to the families of victims in the crash, ``acknowledge
responsibility for the actions of its officials'' and ``cooperate
with the investigation and the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   While Libya, in handing over the suspects, had moved ``a
critical step closer'' to achieving the justice that would enable
sanctions to be ended, Indyk said, Libya had to fulfill the other
conditions as well. The United States is prepared to veto any
resolution to end the sanctions, he added, ``if it is presented
before we are satisfied with the Libyan actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Annan is supposed to offer his views on
whether Tripoli has fulfilled the Security Council's requirements
in a report next month. But the trial of the two suspects has been
delayed until next February at the earliest, which will complicate
Annan's ability to judge whether Libya is cooperating fully with
the trial.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat described the meeting Friday as ``very
professional'' and the atmosphere as cordial. Burleigh did not talk
to reporters after the session, but Dorda called the meeting a
``special day'' for Libyan-American relations. ``It will lead us
all to turn over the last page of the past and then we will open a
new one,'' he told reporters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that Libya has benefited handsomely from the
suspension of sanctions. Since April, Europeans in particular have
flocked to Tripoli in hope of securing lucrative contracts for the
development of Libya's estimated reserves _ 30 billion barrels of
oil and 55 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Takeyh, a research fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy, said, for example, that five European consortiums
are competing for a $5.5 billion contract to develop Libyan gas.
Even without a permanent lifting of sanctions, he said, ``Libya has
effectively escaped its isolation and re-entered the international
arena.''

 TEAR IN REBECCA LOBO'S KNEE IS COMPLETE , BUT SHE WILL PLAY AGAIN,
DOCTORS SAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news on Rebecca Lobo was bad and good Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Craig Scott, the Liberty's team physician, said the injury
Lobo sustained Thursday night in an 87-60 season-opening victory
over the Cleveland Rockers was a complete tear of the anterior
cruciate ligament in the left knee. She said Lobo also tore the
meniscus, which is fibrous cartilage in the knee joint.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Lobo, one of the marquee players in the Women's
National Basketball Association, would undergo reconstructive
surgery in two or three weeks, when the swelling goes down and the
range of motion is normal. She said Lobo would miss the rest of the
three-month season, but should regain full strength after at least
six months of rehabilitation and be able to play next season with
no loss of movement.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the inflammation, Lobo began therapy Friday morning at
Beth Israel Hospital, North Division. The therapy will continue
until the surgery. Then Lobo will stay in New York for
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   After an emotional night, Lobo was positive during a
teleconference Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first injury I've ever had that's taken me out of
commission for a long time,'' she said. ``I've had a scope on the
other knee, but this is the first thing of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Lobo, a 6-foot-4-inch power forward, led the
University of Connecticut to the national championship in 1995,
when she was voted the player of the year. She has started all 59
games in the Liberty's two-plus seasons. She was injured only 42
seconds into the game in Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a real sweet offensive rebound,'' she said. ``When I
came down, my thought was that somebody hit me on the side of my
knee because it buckled. I knew as soon as it happened that it was
torn. I never felt anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   For 20 seconds, while Lobo clutched her leg and screamed in
pain, no one called a timeout. Finally, the officials did. Lobo was
helped to the locker room and later taken to the hospital, where a
magnetic resonance imaging test disclosed the injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Lobo's mother and grandmother were in the Garden and rushed to
the locker room after the injury. Lobo's mother, RuthAnn, is in
remission from breast cancer, and mother and daughter wrote a book
telling how they had confronted the illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was a roller coaster of emotions,'' Lobo said of
the post-injury scene. ``I finally felt OK, spoke to my mom and the
tears came. Then I was OK. Then I spoke to my dad and the tears
came. I'm disappointed this happened, but at the same time I'm
upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said torn anterior cruciate ligaments were five to eight
times more common among female basketball players than male. She
cited three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   Anatomical _ the narrowness of the notch where the ligament is
attached prevents more flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Hormonal _ female ligaments are looser.
</P>
<P>
   Muscle mass _ a woman's muscle mass is not the size of a man's,
so when a woman's knee is injured with force, the muscles do not
protect her as well as they protect a man.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Jones Young, drafted by the Liberty last month after a
highly successful career in the defunct American Basketball League,
tore the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in her
right knee in January. Scott said Young was making good progress.
</P>
<P>
   With Lobo out, 32-year-old Sue Wicks, who is 6-3, will start
against the Sting Saturday night in Charlotte. There will be more
playing time for two rookies _ 6-2 Tamika Whitmore and 6-6 Michele
VanGorp. Whitmore is comfortable offensively in the low post. The
slender VanGorp is a solid outside shooter but is not strong.
Whitmore played 21 minutes and VanGorp 6 against the Rockers, and
while both had good offensive moments, they also had defensive
problems in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to learn from Sue,'' Lobo said. `They'll
have to learn under fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lobo will try to get ready for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is diminished,'' Scott said of her
patient. ``We'll let her play when the strength is equal from one
side to the other and the stability is equal. That's the end point
of the therapy and then we turn her loose. She'll make a full
recovery. She's a tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobo left no doubt that she would be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday,'' she said, ``the tears flowed. Today, I'm starting
to get better.''

SERB CIVILIANS JOIN TROOPS LEAVING KOSOVO CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Waving their guns and their traditional
three-finger salutes, thousands of Yugoslav soldiers rolled through
the Kosovo capital Friday on their way north, triumphant in
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   But more telling than the departing military vehicles were the
cars, tractors, and flatbed trucks interspersed among them. Serb
civilians were fleeing Kosovo, unmoved by NATO's pledge to protect
them from the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and the soon-to-return
ethnic Albanian refugees who were expelled by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   The cars carried families, clothing, and sticks of furniture,
and bore license plates indicating they came from the areas like
Djakovica and Prizren, where ethnic hatred was intense and where
the KLA could soon fill the vacuum created by withdrawing Serb
forces. Near Prizren, there was a convoy stretching more than 2
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Kosovo border, one car inched along, a mother and
father in the front seat, their school-age son crammed into the
back seat with bags of clothes, pillows and a Kalashnikov rifle.
The boy stared wide-eyed, his head resting on a rifle barrel
against the window.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of similar scenes on the border with the
republic of Montenegro, where local police told a UN refugee
official in Rozaje that about 250 Serbs and Montenegrins from
Kosovo had crossed the border in the previous two days.
</P>
<P>
   There were believed to be about 200,000 Serbs in Kosovo before
the war, about 10 percent of the province's population. Estimates
now put that number at 100,000, because many moved out when the
NATO bombing began.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, where the pre-war population of 250,000 has shrunk
to about 100,000, ethnic Albanians and Serbs always got along
better than in the more segregated, more bitterly divided
countryside. But the sight of their army, their police, and their
frightened compatriots leaving has got even fair-minded Serbs in
Pristina asking: Why are we staying?
</P>
<P>
   Alexander ``Simi'' Milosavljevic, 25, has thought about that a
lot lately. Most of his neighbors, Serbs and Albanians, have left.
His brother fled to Belgrade with his wife and three children. But
Milosavljevic needs only to take five exams to finish law school.
Despite the destruction throughout his country, he thinks there is
a future for him in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay,'' he said. ``I don't have anywhere else to go. I am
not a rich man. Besides, I didn't do anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that some of his countrymen did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people must be frightened about their destiny,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he doesn't believe most Albanians will come back looking
for revenge. His nickname _ Simi _ is Albanian, and although he is
Serbian, he had many Albanian friends before most of them fled.
</P>
<P>
   Like others here, he believes that most Serbs in the countryside
will flee, because they feel vulnerable to attack by the KLA and
because they don't believe that the American or other NATO soldiers
about to enter Kosovo are neutral when it comes to the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Milosavljevic worked for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which had been monitoring the escalating
violence between the KLA and Serb forces before the OSCE left
Kosovo right before the bombing began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Americans talking to Albanians in front of me. They
helped the KLA. They weren't so independent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, several hundred people gathered in Pristina's
center after rumors circulated that a contingent of Russian
soldiers was on the way to Pristina. It was a raucous crowd, and
their enthusiasm for the Russians underscored how little faith they
put in the word of the Western allies that they will be treated no
differently than the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Milosavljevic, who had served in the army, was called up again
to defend Kosovo. He wanted to serve, but his association with OSCE
made him suspect, ``so they discharged me.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his best friends were drafted and were killed by NATO
bombs. Several other friends also were killed. Their pictures and
death notices adorn mail boxes and storefronts here, a local
custom.
</P>
<P>
   Milosavljevic, however, remains free of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be angry,'' he said. ``I can't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosavljevic is unusual among Serbs here. Despite his anger at
NATO, he has a fondness for things from the West and doesn't hate
Westerners for things their governments have done. Friday, fellow
Serbs refused to serve him at three cafes when he tried to sit down
with Americans. The last man to refuse to serve the group was
Milosavljevic's brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get out!'' his brother barked.
</P>
<P>
   Milosavljevic, who wore a University of Michigan basketball
T-shirt, said his father worked for Texas Instruments in the United
States for several years before returning here in 1991, incensed by
what he saw as anti-Serb bias in the US news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is a super patriot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosavljevic said he will express his patriotism ``by staying,
by not running away.''
</P>
<P>
   Others here seem less sure of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Stojanka Mitrovic, 46, who like so many other people here is
unemployed, said she is terrified about what may happen in the next
few days as Serb forces pull out. Her uncertainty is shared by
many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, I'm afraid for the children,'' she said. ``I will try
to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said she will base her decision on the way NATO forces
behave when they get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO should protect us. We have the same rights as
Albanians,'' she said. ``The way NATO protects us will decide how
many Serbs stay.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a dirty war. Most shops and businesses have had
their windows smashed and their interiors trashed. The few that
survived unscathed had on their doorways a painted logo with four
C's and a cross, a symbol that means ``Only unity saves the
Serbs.'' Like lamb's blood to a newborn in the Old Testament story,
the symbol spared the Serb-owned shops.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' sense of abandonment, meanwhile, grew with each
passing convoy of soldiers. After low-flying NATO jets terrorized
this city for 78 days, the deafening roar of two formations of
seven Yugoslav MIGs flying over on the way to Belgrade was hardly
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   Bursts of gunfire sounded as often and as routinely as church
bells. A few miles outside the city, some Albanian homes, notable
for the brick walls that surround them, were on fire as retreating
Serb soldiers left a calling card.
</P>
<P>
   Many Serbs here denounce such behavior, some because they
genuinely oppose it, others because they say they'll have to answer
for it when the Albanians return.
</P>
<P>
   Milenko Savovic was philosophical as the fleeing refugees and
the retreating soldiers passed through the city he has called home
for all his 63 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid, because I'm old,'' he said. ``They can kill
me if there's any cause to kill me. I was born here and I expect to
die here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he believed NATO troops would protect Serbs, the old
man replied, ``If they're human, they'll protect us.''

<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ The lobby of the Sheraton Hotel here was packed
with dark-suited bankers last Wednesday, when Barbara J. Lundberg
blazed in.
</P>
<P>
   Her strawberry-red hair, bright enough to spot across the huge
room, had once again begun to rebel against her efforts to tame it.
But her freckled face scrunched up in easy laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a picture of me that I liked,'' she remarked
as she begged to avoid being photographed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like it or not, Mrs. Lundberg is the center of a lot of
attention here.
</P>
<P>
   A former Wall Street executive who set up a venture capital fund
in Warsaw nine years ago, Mrs. Lundberg is suddenly in charge of
one of Poland's biggest and messiest conglomerates. Her goal?
Engineering a billion-dollar bet on telecommunications to compete
against Poland's former state telephone monopoly in both wireless
and traditional telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities and the risks are enormous. Poland, with its
population of 42 million and its remarkably strong growth, has
become Central Europe's hottest target for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investors, mostly banks, own 50 percent of the shares in
Poland's banks. Foreign phone companies, including SBC
Communications of the United States and Deutsche Telekom AG of
Germany, are circling with interest around the government's plan to
sell off a big chunk of the national phone company.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to match the audacity of Mrs. Lundberg's plan. If
she succeeds, analysts predict Elektrim's debt will double to about
$1 billion next year.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Mrs. Lundberg became the chief executive of
Elektrim SA, a sprawling post-communist behemoth that had alienated
shareholders by buying up businesses from cable manufacturing to
chicken farms.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited by rebellious shareholders, many of them American
investment firms, Mrs. Lundberg has dismissed Elektrim's top
management and moved to sell off stakes in more than 80 companies.
</P>
<P>
   But far more important, she has plunged into the
telecommunications business with a string of acquisition totaling
more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she cemented a key part of her plan by teaming with
Vivendi SA, the French media and telecommunications conglomerate.
Vivendi will invest about $750 million to acquire 30 percent of
Elektrim's telecommunications ventures, which will be pooled into a
new joint-venture company.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Mrs. Lundberg plans to up the ante once again. In
need of big money to build high-speed networks around Poland, she
will try to raise about $500 million through a global convertible
bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the financial risks a huge challenge; so are the
political ones. Elektrim's strategy assumes in large part that the
Polish government will allow only one rival in each city to TPSA,
the former Polish telephone monopoly. But political leaders have
vacillated under strong lobbying pressure from a Swedish-backed
rival, Netia Holdings, and suggested Friday that they might change
the game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Worried about violating Securities and Exchange Commission
restrictions about promoting stocks before a public securities
offering, Mrs. Lundgren refused to talk about her plans with
American publications this week.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she has long been one of Warsaw's most visible
foreigners, and the broad elements of her plan are clear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many expatriate American entrepreneurs here, Mrs.
Lundberg did not come to Warsaw because of her Polish ancestry. Now
47, she had worked as a venture capitalist in California and later
as vice president for corporate finance at Kidder Peabody &AMP;
Company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, less than a year after the collapse of Poland's last
communist regime, she organized the Polish American Enterprise
Fund, a venture capital fund financed initially by the American
government to encourage the development of Poland's private sector.
</P>
<P>
   The fund was successful enough that she subsequently began
several other investment outfits, which together managed about $500
million at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Elektrim, by contrast, was a direct holdover from the communist
era. Based around several of Poland's formerly state-owned
industrial companies, it was privatized as the country's biggest
producer of power-generation equipment, electrical cable and a
provider of engineering services.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other privatized companies in Eastern Europe, it
remained largely under control of the same managers as it had
during the old regime. The key player was Andrzej Skowronski, its
chairman, who took the company public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange
and then used its cash flow to buy up a treasure trove of smaller
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Poland's steady economic ascent under governments
that consistently pushed the country toward private enterprise,
many soured investors came to view Elektrim as a bad example of
Russian-style crony capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Elektrim's strategy was opaque, and its financial disclosure was
even worse. Dozens of companies and stakes in other companies were
hived off into separate entities, with the result that few people
had any idea what its true assets really were.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, Elektrim reported sales of $182 million
and a loss of $94 million. But those numbers did not include many
of the company's biggest properties, like its big cable-producing
business or its 34 percent stake in one of Poland's two nationwide
cellular telephone carriers, Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter to shareholders, Mrs. Lundberg estimated that
Elektrim's core equipment and engineering businesses were worth
about $886 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the real revolt came after revelations last year that
Elektrim had secretly agreed to sell part of its stake in the
wireless company _ the one business that enjoyed rocketing sales
and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by dissident shareholders, believed to include investment
funds run by Merrill Lynch among others, Mrs. Lundberg took over as
chief executive in early February.
</P>
<P>
   With an uncanny knack to charm almost anybody, people who know
her say Mrs. Lundberg, a twice-divorced mother with a ten-year-old
son, is tough and shrewd as well. She knows the key players in
Warsaw's elite and she has mapped out the political minefields.
</P>
<P>
   She has not been shy about imposing her ideas. Besides ensuring
the departure of Skowronski, Mrs. Lundberg got rid of Elektrim's
vice chairman and chief accountant. Then she recruited two top
executives from ABB Asea Brown Boveri's Poland subsidiary to map
out a clean-up effort.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scheme they devised, Elektrim will jettison stakes in
more than 80 ``non-core'' businesses and re-focus on power
generation equipment, power engineering and telecommunications.

BALKANS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every day for nearly three months, the Pentagon has
displayed footage detailing the damage NATO bombs have done to
Yugoslavia -- bridges dropped, railroads crippled, buildings left
in smoldering ruins.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton boards Air Force One on Tuesday for a
week-long victory lap through Europe, the lead agenda item will be
deciding who will pick up the multi-billion-dollar tab to rebuild
many of those very assets so efficiently targeted by U.S. and
allied pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Having borne the risks of war, the United States and Europe must
now pony up the price of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to have to do, as we go forward, is to figure
out (how) to appropriately apportion, the cost of this,'' Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin told reporters on Thursday. ``We should do
what's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the United States and its NATO allies embark on their
high-stakes peacekeeping role in Kosovo, Clinton journeys this week
to Europe to take up the longer-term mission of Balkans recovery
and reintegration into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to spend Wednesday and Thursday in Switzerland
and France, then travel to Cologne, Germany, to meet with his
counterparts from the so-called Group of Seven, G-7, industrial
democracies (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the
United States) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin is scheduled to join the club on
Saturday and Sunday, for what has come to be known as the G-8.
Clinton will spend the following Monday in the tiny Balkan country
of Slovenia -- the first of four republics to break away from the
former Yugoslavia -- and he's hinted at a possible visit to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his fellow G-7 leaders plan to issue a statement
Friday on moving forward with immediate peacemaking and
reconstruction in Kosovo, and the longer-term, and far broader,
goal of helping to knit the entire Balkans region back into the
rapidly modernizing fabric of central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want the conflict now ending in Kosovo to be the
prelude to others,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Thursday, following a meeting with her G-8 counterparts in Cologne.
``We want to build the true basis for a new era of peace; so that
the future wars are prevented, economies grow, democratic
institutions attain their potential and the rights of all are
preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing that will take time - decades perhaps. It will
also take a great deal of money -- as much as $30 billion in public
money alone over the next five years, according to estimates that
came out of Cologne last week, where the top diplomats from the G-8
countries initialed a pact on Balkans reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The pact is likely to frame the outlines of Friday's G-7
dialogue, and a starting point, at least, for divvying up the costs
of securing long-term stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Having shouldered the lion's share of the costs of the NATO air
campaign, the United States plans to send Europe the bill for
patching up its southern doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect that most of the money would come through
Europe, because most of the costs of this campaign, the air
campaign, have been borne by the United States,'' Clinton said
Thursday. ``I don't want us to get into a haggling situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a Balkans analyst with the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank, said the European Union expects Americans
will pay no more than a dime on the dollar for what amounts to a
Balkans Marshal Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any European government which believes
that the United States will even come up with 10 percent of the $30
billion,'' Daalder said Friday. ``We had a tremendous difficulty
coming up with $600 million for Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   After NATO air strikes and American diplomacy ended the war in
Bosnia in 1995, the World Bank estimated emergency reconstruction
needs there at $5.1 billion over four years. As of May, the United
States and five dozen other donor nations had pledged $4.6 billion,
and some $3.5 billion had been spent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer haul, Bosnia will need $20 billion worth of
public and private investment, however, to rebuild the homes,
telephone lines, water systems, roads and other major facilities
lost to the 3 1/2 year-long war.
</P>
<P>
   The European Community and the World Bank have already set up an
office in Brussels to coordinate reconstruction aid for Southeast
Europe. As of Saturday, it's even got its own web site
(HTTP://www.seerecon.org) and will soon announce a donor's
conference to try to raise international funding for repairing the
damage inflicted in recent months on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no good estimates on the destruction there, NATO
pilots have confirmed some 500 communities burned to ash and ember
over the past 11 weeks. Entire parts of the provincial capital of
Pristina have been looted by Serb soldiers -- one group of which
pulled into town after Belgrade agreed to peace and made off with
two truckloads of booty.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO bombs have destroyed dozens of bridges, railroads and
intersections across the province, in an effort to grind the Serb
forces there to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Serbia proper, NATO bombs took a far larger toll,
destroying two huge refineries, dozens of bridges and scores of
factories, airfields, radio and television facilities and telephone
and electricity systems. Long-term recovery costs in Serbia proper
could well top Bosnia's $20 billion estimate, though no one in the
G-8 capitals is talking about those costs quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
have publicly ruled out providing reconstruction money for Serbia
so long as Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, is in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he remains in power, as long as your nation is
ruled by an indicted war criminal, we will provide no support for
the reconstruction of Serbia,'' Clinton vowed to Serbs in his
televised Oval Office address Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to Balkans reconstruction than clearing the rubble
of war. Nearly a decade of conflict throughout much of the former
Yugoslavia has forced neighboring front-line states like Hungary
and Bulgaria to pay dearly in lost jobs and trade.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has concluded that those countries and their
neighbors will fall into the equivalent of a recession this year --
with economic output shrinking an estimated 1.7 percent , on
average -- strictly due to the trade losses associated with the
NATO air war. The World Bank estimates that propping up the
economies of the front-line states will require $1.3 billion in
humanitarian aid and budget relief over the coming months to avert
dire consequences in the countries rimming Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are boats sitting in Hungary right now that would like
to get to Ukraine that can't get there,'' said World Bank spokesman
David Theis. Blocking their route are a half dozen bridges NATO
bombs dropped into the Danube river, the major transport link
between the Balkans and the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Romania estimates its economic losses from the last three months
at $800 million -- 2 percent of its annual output. Those trade
losses don't count, by the way, the house that was destroyed when a
U.S. missile flew 60 miles wide of its target and slammed into a
residential suburb of Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the poorest countries in Europe -- Albania and Macedonia
-- have between them shared the burden of accommodating nearly
800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who fled neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries have suffered enough,'' Daalder said during a
Brookings briefing on Friday. ``They have proven that they want to
be part of the European mainstream, and we owe them our
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is certain to use his trip through Europe this week to
echo Daalder's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be real. It's not only $30 billion just to deal with the
region; we're going to be there for many, many, many years, if not
decades,'' said Daalder. ``The challenge for the first decade of
the 21st century will be for Europe and the United States to
cooperate together to bring
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern Europe into the continent's mainstream.''

WARSAW, Poland: and telecommunications.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the three, telecom is to be the main event. Mrs. Lundberg
quickly scrapped the deal to sell off the stake in the wireless
company, agreeing to pay the aspiring buyer $25 million to go away.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she negotiated to acquire a controlling stake of 51
percent in the wireless venture, for which Elektrim will pay about
$700 million. On top of that, she reached a deal to buy up Bresnan
International Partners, a cable television operator, for $325
million. Bresnan operates cable systems in northwest Poland as well
as a fiber optic network in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lundberg is also negotiating to buy a consortium of local
telephone operators in other cities around Poland, a deal that is
expected to cost several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Elektrim will need to invest hundreds of millions
of dollars in new networks and in launching new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing she needed strategic partners, Mrs. Lundberg began talks
with Deutsche Telekom. But those talks bogged down over disputes
over control.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lundberg had much better luck with Vivendi, a one-time
water company that owns stakes in media companies and competes
against France Telecom in both wireless and wired phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors have generally applauded the new
strategy, but the political risks are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk is regulatory risk,'' said Pajak Sobek, an
analyst at Wood &AMP; Co. in Warsaw. ``No one knows, including
Elektrim, what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland is taking a relatively slow path toward allowing
competition in the telephone market. It has begun issuing licenses
allowing a single rival in each of Poland's major cities to the
state system. Long-distance and international service, which are
far more lucrative, will be off-limits for another few years.
</P>
<P>
   But even that modest plan has been wobbly and politically messy.
Elektrim waged a long and bitter battle against Netia Holdings,
whose biggest shareholder is the Swedish telephone company Telia
AB, just to acquire a local license in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   After months of lobbying and acrimony, Elektrim announced this
week that the government had guaranteed it the exclusive license
for Warsaw. But then, days later, Polish newspapers quoted
government officials saying they might allow another rival into the
Warsaw market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very bad for Elektrim, because of their
assumption that they would be the sole rival for the next five
years,'' said Sobek. It would also raise deeper fears about future
decisions to change the rules of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lundberg seems determined to stay. Poland, she said, ``is
my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she still speaks Polish only haltingly, she quickly won
over many Elektrim workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may speak Polish and I may speak English,'' she told
workers shortly after arriving. ``But in business we are all
speaking the same language.''

 &HT;    SUFFERING OF KOSOVAR ALBANIANS STOKES LONGTIME ETHNIC HATREDS
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-G8-$ADV13.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Kosovar Serbs are loading up their families
and fleeing Kosovo in fear of facing down their old neighbors, the
Kosovar Albanians who are about to return from here wrapped in
righteous anger and the road dust of NATO tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs may be wise to leave. The Balkan ethnic pendulum is
beginning its inevitable backward swing.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians of Kosovo are in no mood to be forgiving,
not after the weeks and months of terror they passed, not after the
degrading, violent treatment so many suffered, or after losses like
the feeble grandfathers shot and babies expired on the tear-stained
roadways of exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our neighbors are Serbian police and paramilitary,'' said Isof
Ibrahimi, a 20-year-old refugee here speaking of his village near
Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo. ``They came to us
masked, but we know their names. We know where they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ibrahimis are in no hurry to leave their tent camp and get
home to what they believe is only a shell of a house -- if they are
lucky -- and to the memories of the burning bodies they said they
saw from the window of the train that took them away.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they do get back, they don't want those Serb neighbors
to be in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did very bad things. There is no place for them any
more,'' said Ibrahimi. ``In our neighborhood, no. Maybe in another
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians and Serbs, peoples with different language,
different religion, different customs, have been mangling each
other since about the 7th Century, when the first Serbs arrived and
began jostling for dominance throughout the Balkans with the people
already in place -- including the ancestors of today's ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Killings and rapes have haunted families on both sides of this
ethnic divide for centuries. More recently, the Kosovo Liberation
Army hardly had been fighting a dainty battle for independence
before the Serb hammer came down on the province to crush it.
</P>
<P>
   That is when today's ethnic Albanians became the latest and
perhaps most profoundly injured of the victims in this long-playing
conflict. In any event, their injury under the Serbs' fierce ethnic
cleansing campaign has been the most widely recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began several days before NATO bombs fell on
Yugoslavia and continued in an erratic, inexplicable pattern that
sent tens of thousand of refugees flooding out of the country one
day, then none the next. Of about 1.8 million ethnic Albanians --
who made up 90 percent of Kosovo's population -- at least 800,000
now are refugees and an estimated
</P>
<P>
   500,00 are internally displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Early stories of simple expulsion gave way to tales of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Then satellite photos showed fresh, mass graves, and air
reconnaissance films documented scores of burned out villages. The
most eloquent images were the distraught faces and haggard bodies
of the refugees themselves as they crossed the borders of Kosovo
into Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Many who came out had been on the run for days or for weeks,
living in mountains on what they carried along or could scavenge
from houses they would raid under cover of darkness. They saw their
homes destroyed by Serb grenades, cattle slaughtered and even their
children put to death.
</P>
<P>
   How can Hodit Aslemi forget the sight he described of a Serb
shooting his son, not 15 feet from where the 59-year-old sat in the
tractor that would carry the survivors of his family to safety?
</P>
<P>
   How will Ferhat Halimi look at his hand and fail to remember the
last touch of his daughter-in-law, who ran to him for help when a
Serb soldier ordered her down from her tractor cart, everyone
assumed to be raped? She was clutching Halimi's hand when the
angered soldier ran a line of bullets down her spine.
</P>
<P>
   How will Ahmed Byqmeti even be able to face going home? At the
urging of his elderly parents, he left them, his brother and
sister-in-law at home, and now he has had no word for two months.
His perpetually twisted face signals the anguish his words express.
He expects the worst, blames himself for surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little hope,'' he said. ``I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the children of Haqif and Ilmija Alili grow up? The
oldest is seven and the baby four months, so none will remember
much about the harrowing four-day journey out of Kosovo, walking
and riding and walking some more, to escape the Serb shooting in
their village and threats of harm. They won't remember much of the
harsh life in a tent, where Ilmija, 27, bemoans her inability to
keep her children clean or clear up her baby's vivid heat rash.
</P>
<P>
   They never will know the father's cousin who was killed by
Serbs, but surely they will hear about him. And not for a long time
are these beautiful Kosovar Albanian children likely to rub
shoulders with any Serbs, not, said their mother, if she can help
it.

ON BEIRUT'S BEACHES, MEN AND WOMEN ARE SEGREGATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Ah, summertime, and Beirut is flocking to the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   All along the dazzling shore, the people frolic. They dive from
splendid rocks into the swirling sea. They swim in sheltered coves,
and whack balls back and forth with wooden paddles. They sprawl
languidly in the Mediterranean sun.
</P>
<P>
   But something is missing from this picture-postcard-perfect
scene. The women seem to have been airbrushed out. So where are
Beirut's women on this dazzling day? At home _ or, sometimes, just
a few yards away, behind walls that let them frolic, too, but away
from the looks and talk that could destroy a reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be so bad in Lebanon,'' Ghada Faour, a 25-year-old
secretary, said as she and a friend basked in string bikinis at
Ajram, a private women's-only beach just around the corner from the
all-male scene. ``Here we're more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, before the 1975-1991 civil war, Beirut was
sometimes known as the Paris of the Middle East. It is still,
undeniably, a cosmopolitan capital, with elegant restaurants,
dance-till-you drop nightclubs and a dress-to-kill fashion sense.
It still deserves its slightly libertine reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But, particularly in mostly Muslim West Beirut, that culture has
always been overlaid by more conservative strands, including very
specific ideas about what should and not be seen when it comes to
female flesh. The combination can be volatile, and one solution, in
summertime, is segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't bring my fiancee here because if someone said
something, like what a beautiful girl, there'd have to be a
fight,'' said Hassan Karaki, 25, who sat wearing stylish
sunglasses, sipping beer and smoking a water pipe on a public
beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to have men and women on the beach together,
but there are advantages to being apart,'' he said. ``The guys
don't have to watch their language, and if the girls go to the
women's beaches, they can wear anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the weather, in the high 70s, was ideal, and the
beach was packed _ bronzed male bodies everywhere. Only a handful
of women could be seen, and most were fully clothed, and sheltered
by tents or beach umbrellas. Those who swam simply strolled into
the water, until their baggy dresses began to float along beside
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way we were brought up,'' Mohammed Tayid, 23, said
with a shrug when asked whether he enjoyed the all-male scene. For
company, he and his friends had sculptured a buxom woman out of
sand.
</P>
<P>
   Randa Harb, 27, wore a modest pair of shorts and a tank top as
she sat under an umbrella with her bare-chested husband and young
son. ``If you wear a bathing suit, you're going to attract more
attention,'' Mrs. Harb said. ``So my husband won't let me, because
he doesn't want people to look and talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the whirl that is Beirut, neither the segregation
nor the modesty are universal. Among the mobile-phone set, whose
conversations switch seamlessly from Arabic to English to French,
summertime means a membership at a club like the Summerland or the
Riviera. There, the sexes mix freely, and some women dress
daringly, in itsy-bitsy bikinis with matching platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the St. George's Yacht Club, renowned before
Lebanon's civil war by journalists and spies as a place to admire
the beauty of the women lolling by the pool. And up and down
Lebanon's coast are smaller, private beaches where middle-class
families might pay about $6 a person to spend a weekend day.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to public places, where anyone might pass,
women are always scarce. Mohammed Suhel, 26, a tailor who regularly
spends his late afternoons at the beach, said he always leaves his
fiancee behind. ``If she did come, I wouldn't let her wear a
bathing suit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon is not alone, of course, as home to a culture averse to
women showing too much skin. In Iran, a strict Islamic republic,
the insistence on female modesty means that women may not even
enter hotel pools. In most Arab countries, except among elites, a
standard woman's bathing costume is a dress.
</P>
<P>
   But Lebanon is different. Its substantial Christian population
has always contributed to a relatively libertine air, and its
geography means that most people live in close proximity to its
140-mile coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Ras Beirut, the heart of the capital, is a nob of land that
stretches into the sea, so the breeze is always salty. By 9 on any
weekend morning, the rocks below the seafront corniche are already
full of groups of boys and men, often in nothing more than bikini
bottoms as they begin a day of sunning, rough-housing, fishing and
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut women, if allowed to go out at all, head to places like
Ajram and Costa Brava, where for $6 or so they can buy privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The last man they see is the one who takes their tickets, a
female journalist said. Even male children are barred once they
turn 7. Female lifeguards whistle away boats that stray near ogling
range. And women unwind enough to dance to the Arabic music that a
female disk jockey blares from the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to dance where there are men, but here, we can
dance,'' said Ms. Faour, the young woman sunning herself at Ajram.
Her friend, Lina Abdo, 24, said her fiance preferred that she stick
to the women's beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Ms. Abdo said, ``he's a man, and this is the
Middle East.''

BALKANS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-REFUGEES-$ADV13.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Every day for nearly three months, the Pentagon has
displayed footage detailing the damage NATO bombs have done to
Yugoslavia -- bridges dropped, railroads crippled, buildings left
in smoldering ruins.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton boards Air Force One on Tuesday for a
week-long victory lap through Europe, the lead agenda item will be
deciding who will pick up the multi-billion-dollar tab to rebuild
many of those very assets so efficiently targeted by U.S. and
allied pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Having borne the risks of war, the United States and Europe must
now pony up the price of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to have to do, as we go forward, is to figure
out (how) to appropriately apportion, the cost of this,'' Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin told reporters on Thursday. ``We should do
what's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   As the United States and its NATO allies embark on their
high-stakes peacekeeping role in Kosovo, Clinton journeys this week
to Europe to take up the longer-term mission of Balkans recovery
and reintegration into Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He's scheduled to spend Wednesday and Thursday in Switzerland
and France, then travel to Cologne, Germany, to meet with his
counterparts from the so-called Group of Seven, G-7, industrial
democracies (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the
United States) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin is scheduled to join the club on
Saturday and Sunday, for what has come to be known as the G-8.
Clinton will spend the following Monday in the tiny Balkan country
of Slovenia -- the first of four republics to break away from the
former Yugoslavia -- and he's hinted at a possible visit to
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his fellow G-7 leaders plan to issue a statement
Friday on moving forward with immediate peacemaking and
reconstruction in Kosovo, and the longer-term, and far broader,
goal of helping to knit the entire Balkans region back into the
rapidly modernizing fabric of central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want the conflict now ending in Kosovo to be the
prelude to others,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Thursday, following a meeting with her G-8 counterparts in Cologne.
``We want to build the true basis for a new era of peace; so that
the future wars are prevented, economies grow, democratic
institutions attain their potential and the rights of all are
preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing that will take time - decades perhaps. It will
also take a great deal of money -- as much as $30 billion in public
money alone over the next five years, according to estimates that
came out of Cologne last week, where the top diplomats from the G-8
countries initialed a pact on Balkans reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The pact is likely to frame the outlines of Friday's G-7
dialogue, and a starting point, at least, for divvying up the costs
of securing long-term stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Having shouldered the lion's share of the costs of the NATO air
campaign, the United States plans to send Europe the bill for
patching up its southern doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect that most of the money would come through
Europe, because most of the costs of this campaign, the air
campaign, have been borne by the United States,'' Clinton said
Thursday. ``I don't want us to get into a haggling situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a Balkans analyst with the Brookings Institution, a
Washington think tank, said the European Union expects Americans
will pay no more than a dime on the dollar for what amounts to a
Balkans Marshal Plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any European government which believes
that the United States will even come up with 10 percent of the $30
billion,'' Daalder said Friday. ``We had a tremendous difficulty
coming up with $600 million for Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   After NATO air strikes and American diplomacy ended the war in
Bosnia in 1995, the World Bank estimated emergency reconstruction
needs there at $5.1 billion over four years. As of May, the United
States and five dozen other donor nations had pledged $4.6 billion,
and some $3.5 billion had been spent.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer haul, Bosnia will need $20 billion worth of
public and private investment, however, to rebuild the homes,
telephone lines, water systems, roads and other major facilities
lost to the 3 1/2 year-long war.
</P>
<P>
   The European Community and the World Bank have already set up an
office in Brussels to coordinate reconstruction aid for Southeast
Europe. As of Saturday, it's even got its own web site
(HTTP://www.seerecon.org) and will soon announce a donor's
conference to try to raise international funding for repairing the
damage inflicted in recent months on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no good estimates on the destruction there, NATO
pilots have confirmed some 500 communities burned to ash and ember
over the past 11 weeks. Entire parts of the provincial capital of
Pristina have been looted by Serb soldiers -- one group of which
pulled into town after Belgrade agreed to peace and made off with
two truckloads of booty.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO bombs have destroyed dozens of bridges, railroads and
intersections across the province, in an effort to grind the Serb
forces there to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Serbia proper, NATO bombs took a far larger toll,
destroying two huge refineries, dozens of bridges and scores of
factories, airfields, radio and television facilities and telephone
and electricity systems. Long-term recovery costs in Serbia proper
could well top Bosnia's $20 billion estimate, though no one in the
G-8 capitals is talking about those costs quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
have publicly ruled out providing reconstruction money for Serbia
so long as Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, is in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he remains in power, as long as your nation is
ruled by an indicted war criminal, we will provide no support for
the reconstruction of Serbia,'' Clinton vowed to Serbs in his
televised Oval Office address Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to Balkans reconstruction than clearing the rubble
of war. Nearly a decade of conflict throughout much of the former
Yugoslavia has forced neighboring front-line states like Hungary
and Bulgaria to pay dearly in lost jobs and trade.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has concluded that those countries and their
neighbors will fall into the equivalent of a recession this year --
with economic output shrinking an estimated 1.7 percent , on
average -- strictly due to the trade losses associated with the
NATO air war. The World Bank estimates that propping up the
economies of the front-line states will require $1.3 billion in
humanitarian aid and budget relief over the coming months to avert
dire consequences in the countries rimming Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are boats sitting in Hungary right now that would like
to get to Ukraine that can't get there,'' said World Bank spokesman
David Theis. Blocking their route are a half dozen bridges NATO
bombs dropped into the Danube river, the major transport link
between the Balkans and the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Romania estimates its economic losses from the last three months
at $800 million -- 2 percent of its annual output. Those trade
losses don't count, by the way, the house that was destroyed when a
U.S. missile flew 60 miles wide of its target and slammed into a
residential suburb of Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the poorest countries in Europe -- Albania and Macedonia
-- have between them shared the burden of accommodating nearly
800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who fled neighboring Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``These countries have suffered enough,'' Daalder said during a
Brookings briefing on Friday. ``They have proven that they want to
be part of the European mainstream, and we owe them our
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is certain to use his trip through Europe this week to
echo Daalder's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be real. It's not only $30 billion just to deal with the
region; we're going to be there for many, many, many years, if not
decades,'' said Daalder. ``The challenge for the first decade of
the 21st century will be for Europe and the United States to
cooperate together to bring
</P>
<P>
   Southeastern Europe into the continent's mainstream.''

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Kosovar Serbs are loading up their families
and fleeing Kosovo in fear of facing down their old neighbors, the
Kosovar Albanians who are about to return from here wrapped in
righteous anger and the road dust of NATO tanks.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs may be wise to leave. The Balkan ethnic pendulum is
beginning its inevitable backward swing.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians of Kosovo are in no mood to be forgiving,
not after the weeks and months of terror they passed, not after the
degrading, violent treatment so many suffered, or after losses like
the feeble grandfathers shot and babies expired on the tear-stained
roadways of exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our neighbors are Serbian police and paramilitary,'' said Isof
Ibrahimi, a 20-year-old refugee here speaking of his village near
Pristina, the provincial capital of Kosovo. ``They came to us
masked, but we know their names. We know where they live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ibrahimis are in no hurry to leave their tent camp and get
home to what they believe is only a shell of a house -- if they are
lucky -- and to the memories of the burning bodies they said they
saw from the window of the train that took them away.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever they do get back, they don't want those Serb neighbors
to be in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did very bad things. There is no place for them any
more,'' said Ibrahimi. ``In our neighborhood, no. Maybe in another
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians and Serbs, peoples with different language,
different religion, different customs, have been mangling each
other since about the 7th Century, when the first Serbs arrived and
began jostling for dominance throughout the Balkans with the people
already in place -- including the ancestors of today's ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Killings and rapes have haunted families on both sides of this
ethnic divide for centuries. More recently, the Kosovo Liberation
Army hardly had been fighting a dainty battle for independence
before the Serb hammer came down on the province to crush it.
</P>
<P>
   That is when today's ethnic Albanians became the latest and
perhaps most profoundly injured of the victims in this long-playing
conflict. In any event, their injury under the Serbs' fierce ethnic
cleansing campaign has been the most widely recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began several days before NATO bombs fell on
Yugoslavia and continued in an erratic, inexplicable pattern that
sent tens of thousand of refugees flooding out of the country one
day, then none the next. Of about 1.8 million ethnic Albanians --
who made up 90 percent of Kosovo's population -- at least 800,000
now are refugees and an estimated
</P>
<P>
   500,00 are internally displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Early stories of simple expulsion gave way to tales of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Then satellite photos showed fresh, mass graves, and air
reconnaissance films documented scores of burned out villages. The
most eloquent images were the distraught faces and haggard bodies
of the refugees themselves as they crossed the borders of Kosovo
into Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Many who came out had been on the run for days or for weeks,
living in mountains on what they carried along or could scavenge
from houses they would raid under cover of darkness. They saw their
homes destroyed by Serb grenades, cattle slaughtered and even their
children put to death.
</P>
<P>
   How can Hodit Aslemi forget the sight he described of a Serb
shooting his son, not 15 feet from where the 59-year-old sat in the
tractor that would carry the survivors of his family to safety?
</P>
<P>
   How will Ferhat Halimi look at his hand and fail to remember the
last touch of his daughter-in-law, who ran to him for help when a
Serb soldier ordered her down from her tractor cart, everyone
assumed to be raped? She was clutching Halimi's hand when the
angered soldier ran a line of bullets down her spine.
</P>
<P>
   How will Ahmed Byqmeti even be able to face going home? At the
urging of his elderly parents, he left them, his brother and
sister-in-law at home, and now he has had no word for two months.
His perpetually twisted face signals the anguish his words express.
He expects the worst, blames himself for surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little hope,'' he said. ``I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   How will the children of Haqif and Ilmija Alili grow up? The
oldest is seven and the baby four months, so none will remember
much about the harrowing four-day journey out of Kosovo, walking
and riding and walking some more, to escape the Serb shooting in
their village and threats of harm. They won't remember much of the
harsh life in a tent, where Ilmija, 27, bemoans her inability to
keep her children clean or clear up her baby's vivid heat rash.
</P>

   They never will know the father's cousin who was killed by
Serbs, but surely they will hear about him. And not for a long time
are these beautiful Kosovar Albanian children likely to rub
shoulders with any Serbs, not, said their mother, if she can help
it.

   BLAST-AFTERMATH (BELLINGHAM, Wash.) _ After more than an hour of
confusing sensor reports and shutting, opening, then shutting a

 &HT;    Bush faces presidential campaign realities this weekend
 &HT;    (Eds: Trip begins Saturday.)
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Gov. George W. Bush embarks today on his
first presidential campaign trip, he'll ride on a jet his aides
have christened ``Great Expectations.'' It will be packed with more
than 100 reporters poised to deflate them.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 100 reporters will be on the ground when he lands
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Bush's Republican rivals, and advocacy
groups eager to pin him down on controversial issues, are also
lying in wait.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush far ahead of his rivals in the race for the
Republican nomination, and he has secured so many major GOP
endorsements and raised so much money that his nomination has taken
on an air of inevitability. But the governor stuck to his pledge to
remain in Austin until the legislative session ended on May 31, and
he hasn't yet faced the withering scrutiny of a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon ends today.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, his wife, Laura, about 20 aides and security personnel and
a media horde from around the country will leave Austin at 7:30
a.m. for Iowa, where caucuses in February will kick off the
presidential campaign season. After a full day of campaigning
there, Bush will head to Maine for a quiet Sunday with his parents
in Kennebunkport. He'll hit the campaign trail again Monday and
Tuesday in New Hampshire, which hosts the nation's first primary,
and then go to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Bush traveled to Chicago and St. Louis for his first
out-of-state fundraisers, and he'll wrap up this weekend's trip
with another one in Greenwich, Conn., on Tuesday. Despite a late
start in personal fund-raising appearances, Bush's campaign war
chest may contain as much as $20 million by the end of the month,
far more than his rivals have collected. Bush has tapped so many
Republican donors that his opponents are falling short of their
fund-raising goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor flew
back to Texas after Friday's Midwest fund-raising swing because he
wanted the chance to schmooze with reporters on the plane trip from
Austin to Iowa. Bush is adept at such personal encounters, but the
rules of the media game are about to change. The governor said he
was concentrating on the Texas Legislature while it was in session,
and he declined to detail his views on many national issues. On
others, such as the war in Kosovo, Bush weighed in after his GOP
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   After months of what The New York Times dubbed the ``Yellow Rose
Garden'' strategy, reporters are eager to press Bush for specifics.
So are Iowa voters, according to Russell Ross, a retired University
of Iowa political scientist who has been following Iowa politics
for almost half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``They expect the candidate to state what he believes on the
major issues. If he does not do that, he's going to probably turn
off the people who are planning to go the polls,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tucker said Bush won't be emphasizing specific policy
proposals on this first foray out-of-state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks it's really important for people to get to know him
and his philosophy and his heart and why he's running for
president,'' Tucker said. ``There will be plenty of time in the
next several months to talk specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two advocacy groups aren't waiting. In anticipation of
Bush's arrival, the Washington-based National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League (NARAL) has been publicizing
Bush's anti-abortion rights statements on billboards and in radio
spots in Iowa. NARAL spokesman Stephen Gaskill said Bush muddied
his stance on the issue several months ago when he said he was
anti-abortion rights, but wouldn't push for a constitutional
amendment banning abortion if he were elected president because
most Americans wouldn't support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is creating the impression that he wouldn't bother trying
to change where we are with choice in America today, that he
wouldn't be a hindrance to choice, or try to change access to
choice, because America's not ready for that,'' Gaskill said. ``But
we know he has a record that he will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   NARAL this week sent packets of information to reporters around
the country, Gaskill said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence also blanketed the nation's
news media this week with a press release titled, ``George W. Bush
Cozies Up to Gun Industry.'' That group is highlighting Bush's
support for Texas' concealed handgun law, and a bill passed this
session that would bar Texas cities from filing lawsuits against
gun makers. Several cities have sued gun manufacturers for damages
resulting from crimes committed with their products, and gun
control advocates are betting on court action as an effective way
to curb access to guns nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one candidate who has not spelled out his position in
any detail on the gun issue,'' said group president Michael Beard.
Bush's Republican rival Elizabeth Dole recently distinguished
herself from the GOP pack by expressing support for some gun
control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want him to understand that his decision on this bill in
his state is going to have national repercussions _ and we'll see
that it does,'' Beard added.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said the governor ``believes
that the best way to deter violence is to severely punish those who
commit crimes with guns,'' and that he supports the gun liability
bill because it will curb frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, several of whom
will be in Iowa this weekend, also are eager to engage him
directly. This week, several of them cautioned Iowa voters against
a rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any idea that he's ready to be president,''
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said during a campaign
appearance in Des Moines. ``Most voters in Iowa couldn't pick him
out of a lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Commentator Pat Buchanan, publisher Steve Forbes and former Vice
President Dan Quayle also urged Iowa Republicans to keep an open
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be darned if we're going to have a nomination that's
inherited,'' Quayle said. ``That's not the way Republicans act.
They want somebody to go in there and fight for it.''

COACH HAS HAD REEL IMPACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vince Reel was such a fast runner that in one year, 1936, he
out-raced three Olympic medalists, Frank Wykoff, Mack Robinson and
Foy Draper. Once, he even beat Jesse Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the track hardly was the only place where people had a hard
time keeping up with Reel.
</P>
<P>
   He was an innovative coach, a pioneering author, a quick wit and
such a talented singer that his voice was heard around the country
on CBS and NBC radio shows during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   These many talents are what his friends, colleagues and former
pupils are remembering as Reel, 85, is dying of prostate cancer. In
the last few weeks, they've phoned, written and visited with Reel,
who is at a hospice in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man of tremendous talents a man for all seasons,''
said USC track coach Ron Allice, who met Reel in the 1950s when
Reel coached at Wilson and Allice ran for Poly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a big kick out of a story in the L.A. Times a few years
ago that he was coming back to coach (at Webb High in Claremont) at
80 years of age. When I first saw the story I thought it was an
obit. I told him if it wasn't, then going back into coaching would
kill him. There's nothing like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reel grew up in Long Beach, attending Jefferson Junior High and
then Wilson High, but through track and field he saw the world. He
coached at Wilson for 20 years before making his mark on the
international scene, coaching India in the 1960 Olympics and China
at the 1972 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes he's coached have represented five countries in the
Olympics and he's been inducted into five Halls of Fame, including
the Century Club and the Mount San Antonio College Relays.
</P>
<P>
   Also through track, Reel met his second wife, Chi Cheng, a
Taiwanese sprinter who set seven world records during the 1960s
when Reel coached her.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the first time Reel picked a good set of legs out of a
crowd. When he coached at Wilson, he pulled John Barnes out of a
physical education class to run on the track team. Just more than
five years later, Barnes was running the 800 meters for the United
States at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Once he identified talented athletes, Reel knew just which
buttons to push for them to excel.
</P>
<P>
   Dick McDonald, a pole vaulter at Wilson who tied for the state
championship in 1950, remembers striving to reach the national high
school record of 13 feet, 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Reel gave McDonald, whose best jump at the time was 13 feet, a
seven-inch strip of cardboard for McDonald to carry in his wallet.
Each time McDonald got closer to the national record, Reel would
trim that number of inches off the piece of cardboard until he
reached the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very demanding, but he had that sense of humor,'' said
John Dixon, a former Press-Telegram sports editor who covered
Reel's teams at Wilson. ``I think when people have his ability as
an athlete, perhaps they're more demanding because they know what a
human athlete is capable of doing. He didn't like to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a point that was driven home to his athletes each
spring. Reel, while he coached at Wilson from 1938 to 1957, made a
point of taking on his top sprinters and hurdlers, even when he was
in his 40s. Reel never lost, which confounded his runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they didn't know is that Vince would get out there early
and close up the spaces between the hurdles,'' said Tom Stewart,
who ran at Wilson, Long Beach City College and USC. ``He knew how
to handle it, but everyone else would get to the first hurdle and
crash into it or be off step.''
</P>
<P>
   This determination to win
</P>
<P>
   that pushed Reel to creative, and sometimes
not-so-sportsmanlike, methods.
</P>
<P>
   In a race against rival Poly, he knew the Jackrabbits would have
two runners chase Stewart in the 880-yard race. So he had another
Wilson runner announced as ``Tom Stewart'' and instructed him to
sprint as long as he could. With half a lap to go, the pseudo
Stewart dropped out and with the two Poly runners spent, the real
Stewart raced to a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince was smart,'' said former Poly coach Leon Forman, who
coached against Reel for 10 years. ``I always admired him because
of his attitude with the kids and how he studied the game and
planned his training exercises. I thought he really knew the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Reel developed a scoring table in the decathlon that soon became
commonplace, according to Allice, and he often handicapped meets
right down to the final point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before a meet he could put the points together and know
exactly where we'd be by the time the relay (the final race) would
start,'' Stewart said. ``In all the meets I participated in, he was
right on the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Reel published a book, ``3471 Tips on Track,'' in 1962 and
founded ``Women's Track and Field World'' magazine in 1968. It
folded in 1985 after other track magazines began devoting more
space to women athletes. The magazine was far ahead of his time,
according to Allice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Track and Field News adopted women's track, (Women's
Track and Field World) was the only voice in the dark for women's
track and field, not just domestically, but internationally,''
Allice said. ``He had guys who were in it for the love of it as
correspondents feeding him stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Reel left Wilson in 1957 to accept a Fulbright Fellowship at the
University of Baghdad in Iraq. He returned the next year to coach
at Claremont-Mudd, the rival of his alma mater, Occidental, for the
next 14 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he came out of retirement to coach Rim of the World
High in Lake Arrowhead to a CIF championship and, at age
</P>
<P>
   81, served as an assistant at Claremont-Mudd three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, in a letter to Dixon, Reel congratulated him on
his jogging regimen. The letter meticulously typed with equal parts
</P>
<P>
   humor and advice was all too Reel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started coaching at Redlands (at age 59), I decided I
should start running, too,'' Reel wrote. ``After months, really
months, I got so I could run a mile but it took me 11 minutes or
more. Finally I said to myself, `Reel you moron, you couldn't run a
mile when you were 20, why are you trying to run one now.' So I
stopped and have felt better ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   To contact Vince Reel, write him at the Sunrise Palomares
Nursing Home, 250 West Artesia Street, Pomona, 91768. Phone: (909)
623-3564.

POLICE END BOYS' JOY RIDE IN STOLEN PLANE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A 16-year-old boy with fewer than four hours of
flying experience sneaked out of a foster home with a friend and
took his mentor's Piper Cherokee on a midnight joyride over Central
Texas, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After a perilous pre-dawn landing in Temple, the runaway boys
refueled, took off and landed again in Brownwood, more than 100
miles from where their trip began. But the boys, including the
``amazing'' unlicensed pilot, were arrested there and now face
possible prison terms for their escapade.
</P>
<P>
   They might have gotten even farther if they had driver's
licenses, credit cards or cash for more aviation fuel, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently starting in the wee hours Thursday, the boys flew in
the fixed-wing, four-seat airplane from Georgetown to Temple, where
they landed at 5:15 a.m. CDT and mixed naturally with other
lounging flyers. About 8 a.m., they were aloft again, flying around
sprawling Fort Hood to Brownwood to rendezvous with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   The ``pilot,'' who had impressed adults with quick learning
skills and a photographic memory, and his 16-year-old companion
were returned by police car from Brownwood to a Williamson County
lockup. Both youths are charged with felony theft of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a religious person, you'll give God all the credit
in this,'' said Michael Moore, the airplane's co-owner who was the
youth's volunteer mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a night solo cross country (flight) without any
formal instructions. This is amazing,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the youth in the pilot seat previously spent only 3.5
hours in the aircraft's co-pilot seat on two flights and fewer than
90 minutes on Moore's desktop flight simulator.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he got to do was watch me from the right seat and
occasionally put his hands on the controls,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The youths were discovered missing about 8 a.m. Thursday from
the Texas Baptist Children's Home in Round Rock, which is just
outside of Austin. Officials weren't sure how they traveled about
12 miles from the open-campus home to the Georgetown Municipal
Airport. But once there, the would-be pilot easily gained access to
the locked-up airplane. He apparently had memorized a lock
combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be the greatest flight instructor that ever lived,''
said Moore, a 56-year-old insurance agent in Round Rock, ``but I
doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore isn't a certified flight instructor but trained Air Force
pilots 30 years ago. He has been mentor to two other Baptist home
residents interested in flight.
</P>
<P>
   The youth who stole his plane had been Moore's acquaintance
since February, when they took the first flight. The second flight
was exactly two weeks ago Saturday, June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The boy wasn't just fascinated by flying, Moore said. He seemed
to pick up on the technical nuances as well or better than adult
trainees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore supplied the boy with reading material, maps and audio
tapes to get him started. The boy probably didn't study the
materials, but he understood the 1964-vintage aircraft's controls
and its new-fangled equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both controls are yoke-mounted GPS (geographic positioning
system) units. I showed him how to use that thing and snap, he had
it,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, on the entire flight (May 29), this kid was
really focused. He had this in his mind, he was going to do this,''
Moore speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Moore got a call from the Baptist home when the ``cottage mom''
noticed the boys missing along with an aviation map.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid that he might try something with the
airplane,'' Moore said. A call to the airport confirmed his plane
was missing.
</P>
<P>
   He described the youth as ``a socially underprivileged kid'' who
had just completed his sophomore year at Round Rock High School. A
disappointing report card threatened to stall the boy's aviation
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only going to do this if he gave me good grades. He did
not give me good grades,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The realistic simulator training may have saved the boys' lives,
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled that simulator like a pro the first time I ever saw
him on it,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just drowning in the flush of relief that it turned out
the way it did. There's no way I can be angry at the kid,'' Moore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Temple airport manager Sharon Rostovich holds no grudge, either,
even though she was duped into thinking the boys _ dressed in
Desert Storm-style military fatigues _ were soldiers from nearby
Fort Hood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bought 10 gallons of fuel, but they had to scrape
together enough money to pay for it. They didn't have a credit card
or anything, but sometimes that happens,'' Rostovich said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys, aware that free ``courtesy cars'' are sometimes
available at airports, inquired about using one, but dropped the
request when they were asked to provide a driver's license,
Rostovich said. Apparently neither had one, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While in the Temple airport, the boys visited extensively with
another youth, dressed in civilian clothes, she said. Observing
them, Rostovich was convinced they were friends and might have been
traveling together. But airport workers said only two boys arrived
on the plane and only two left on it, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured they were just soldiers waiting to be picked up,''
Rostovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They landed and took off like they knew what they were doing.
They intercomed in. They followed all the procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials also aren't sure where the boys' flight path took them
after leaving Temple, but it is known they landed more than three
hours later in Brownwood, which is less than an hour's flight away.
</P>
<P>
   Brownwood Regional Airport assistant manager Mike Wilson said
the boys landed without incident about 11:15 a.m. He said they
called an acquaintance in Brownwood and asked him for a ride into
town, but the friend had no vehicle. The boys then hopped a ride
into Early, just outside Brownwood, to rendezvous with the friend
at a convenience store, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything looked perfectly normal until (Brownwood police)
showed up with a teletype looking for a stolen airplane,'' Wilson

   WASHINGTON _ A new generation of destructive computer viruses
like the ExploreZip ``worm'' that struck last week exposes the
vulnerability of an increasingly networked society.
</P>
<P>
   While diligent computer users can protect their data, experts
said, the prospect is for more widespread and frequent disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The new virus, which is spread through e-mail attachments, is
the third major bug to sweep through cyberspace since late March,
when the Melissa virus overwhelmed systems with floods of messages.
An even more damaging virus named Chernobyl struck in late April,
but it did most of its harm overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ExploreZip, experts say, combines Melissa's propensity to spread
easily with Chernobyl's vicious payload. It may have infected
hundreds of thousands of personal computers, forcing many firms to
unplug their Web servers from the Internet and disrupting
communications and commerce across the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a proliferation of these viruses,'' said Tommy Wald,
president of Netforce Technologies Inc. in Austin, Texas, which
specializes in data recovery. ``What's complicating it even more is
that they're getting even more sophisticated. They're hard to
recover at times, and it seems they're getting harder to detect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's literally hundreds of viruses being created every
month,'' Wald said. ``A lot of it is the hacker-types that have
nothing else to do with their time and just want to see how good
they are. The biggest reason behind it is notoriety and ego.''
</P>
<P>
   With the rapid spread of computer technology through the
business world and into American homes, the number of virus writers
has grown dramatically. Anyone who has taken a basic computer class
can adapt a virus and add his _ or rarely, her _ name to it.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of people write such software bugs, and why do they do
it?
</P>
<P>
   Virus writers ``are in love with doing harm for its own sake,''
said Bruce Sterling, the author of ``Hacker Crackdown,'' a study of
the subculture. ``They poison the digital wells and the flowing
rivers. They believe that information ought to be poisonous and
should hurt other people. Internet people build the networks for
the sake of the net, and that's a fine and noble thing. But virus
people vandalize computers and nets for the pure nasty love of the
wreckage.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet not every virus writer can be labeled as an evil,
technophobic prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the Melissa virus turned out to be David L. Smith,
30, of Eatontown, N.J., a highly regarded programmer for an AT&AMP;T
subcontractor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Altman, Smith's attorney, says his client never intended
to do harm, and that he has been wrongfully portrayed as a
dangerous computer hacker and has been victimized by Washington's
crackdown on high-tech crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer world is a world where people do things,
experimental things, just about every day,'' Altman said. ``Nothing
he did, or intended to do, had a premeditated or wrongful intent.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a crime to write a virus. Rather, the criminal offense
is to damage someone else's computer or the data stored on it, or
to incite others to spread viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Gordon, a British researcher who has written extensively
on the subject, said that ``while many virus writers are motivated
by bad or even criminal intentions and desires, it is dangerous to
assume that this is true of every person who ever writes a program
that can be classified as a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   However diverse the group of virus writers may be, the rapid
rise of the Internet has vastly enlarged their ability to cause
serious damage. Even some of the Internet's greatest champions now
question whether this increasingly powerful tool is truly safe.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-networked era of the early 1980s, many stand-alone
users of personal computers failed to take software viruses very
seriously. One computer pioneer argued at the time that most
reported virus incidents were an urban myth, like alligators in New
York City sewers.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when most computers were self-contained universes, one
simply rebooted the machine to execute an anti-virus program that
searched for bugs and quashed them.
</P>
<P>
   But in the networked world, protection is more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Modern computer viruses can attack your computer without your
even knowing it, warned Jeff Carpenter, team leader at the Computer
Emergency Response Team, at Carnegie Mellon University's Software
Engineering Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are introduced,'' Carpenter noted, ``when you take some
action, such as opening up a document, executing a file or a
program you obtained somewhere ... when you double-click on an
E-mail attachment or on an infected floppy disk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ExploreZip incident, the FBI issued a warning against
opening any suspicious E-mail attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Like common cold germs, today's Internet-borne computer viruses
come in many mutations. Some are simply annoying, while others can
be embarrassing or highly destructive.
</P>
<P>
   Software experts sort malicious bugs into categories known as
Trojan horses, viruses and worms. ExploreZip has hit the jackpot by
showing characteristics of all three.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Trojan horse, it masquerades as an innocent program: a
self-extracting compressed-document file that relies on a user to
launch it. Like a virus, ExploreZip finds a home on a target
system, restarting itself whenever the system reboots. And like a
worm, the program uses network facilities to propagate itself
without relying on further user action.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The best way users can protect themselves from Internet bugs
like ExploreZip is to quash them before they can do any real
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Howard, an anti-virus expert for Ziff-Davis, a computer
magazine publisher, lists some essential precautions that should be
followed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Always be suspicious of E-mail attachments. Do not open them
without first scanning them for viruses.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you own anti-virus software, make sure it is up to date.
Most software houses are able to issue remedies within days of a
new major attack.
</P>
<P>
   _ With the latest program installed, run a full virus check of
your computer every time you turn it on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay informed about the latest developments. Since major virus
strains are often quickly copied, the name of the infected
attachment might readily change.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when all these precautions fail, and another
undetected agent strikes from cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   As a comment posted on an Internet chat group last week put it:
``If you make it idiot-proof, they will make a better idiot.''

TROOP MOVEMENTS RAISE CONCERNS OVER RUSSIA'S INTENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian troops began to move into Yugoslavia on Friday,
prompting fears among NATO leaders that the Kremlin was preparing
to seize its own peacekeeping sector in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After a flurry of urgent phone calls, the Russian foreign
minister, Igor Ivanov, assured the United States that Russia did
not plan to send troops into Kosovo before reaching an
understanding with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. concern about a potential political, and perhaps even
military, confrontation with the Russians was so great that U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, en route to Brussels,
Belgium, by plane, was instructed to turn around in mid-flight and
rush back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's mini-crisis began without warning when about 175
Russian soldiers suddenly left their peacekeeping posts in Bosnia
and drove into Yugoslavia in a column that included 20 to 30
armored vehicles. The troops had painted ``KFOR'' on their
vehicles, the name of the peacekeeping force designated for Kosovo,
indicating they eventually intended to take up positions there.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1,000 paratroopers were on alert, waiting to be flown to
Yugoslavia, the Russian defense ministry said. A senior Russian
official denied Friday night that any of the paratroopers had yet
been sent.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said Washington anticipated that additional
Russian troops would be sent to Yugoslavia because Hungary had
granted a Russian request for overflight rights for its troop
transport planes. The official added that the United States had
received conflicting reports that a Russian IL-76 troop transport
plane might have already landed in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety over the Russian troops underscores the deep
distrust between the two sides following NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia, the most divisive event in Russia's
relations with the West since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   It also points to the Russian military's increasing tendency to
openly challenge the Kosovo peace settlement, which Moscow's own
diplomats helped negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO leaders worried, Kosovo Serbs celebrated. In
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, about 3,000 local Serbs, fired by a
message on local television that Russian peacekeeping forces would
arrive there at 10 p.m. Friday, gathered in the main square, in
front of the Grand Hotel, to greet them. The crowd, boisterous and
noisy, waved Serbian and Yugoslav flags and burned an American one.
Hundreds of rounds of ammunition were shot into the air from
balconies, rooftops and the street.
</P>
<P>
   When midnight came, hundreds of people still remained waiting
for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the alarm among NATO leaders was generated when a senior
Russian defense ministry official, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov,
publicly warned that Moscow might unilaterally send troops to
Kosovo if NATO did not drop its insistence that it command all the
peacekeeping forces there.
</P>
<P>
   It was the abruptness of the Russian troop movements and the
fact that they followed a deadlock about the role of Russian
peacekeepers in Kosovo that alarmed NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have insisted that all the peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo must be under a unified command led by a NATO general.
Russia, however, has adamantly refused to put its troops under NATO
control and has insisted that it be given a sector of its own to
control.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was dealt with indirectly in the resolution the U.N.
Security Council adopted. An annex to the resolution refers to the
need for ``unified command and control'' but does not say
explicitly that NATO must lead the force.
</P>
<P>
   After generals from the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
Russian defense ministry failed to agree in talks here Friday on a
solution to the question of command, the chief Russian negotiator
issued a blunt warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this agreement is not reached, Russia has the same right as
NATO,'' Ivashov said. ``We shall announce a sector that will be
agreed with the Yugoslav side and which will meet our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   His words, coupled with reports of Russian troop movements, set
off alarm bells at NATO's military headquarters in Belgium and at
the Skopje, Macedonia, headquarters of the allied peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military leaders were worried that the Russians might
simply drive into Kosovo, claim a sector in the northern and
heavily Serbian part of the province and, in the words of one
ranking allied official, ``create facts on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is vehemently opposed to the establishment of a
Russian sector, fearing that ethnic Albanians would be afraid to
return there. This could create a de facto partitioning of Kosovo,
with ethnic Albanians in some areas and Serbs in others, an
arrangement NATO has said it would never allow.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that NATO might have won its war with Yugoslavia only to
lose control of the peace, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who was visiting Macedonia, made an urgent phone call to her
counterpart, Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially repudiating Gen. Ivashov, the Russian foreign
minister assured Albright that Russian troops would not enter
Kosovo without an understanding with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Ivanov added, is simply doing what NATO has been doing
for months: assembling peacekeeping forces outside Kosovo in the
anticipation that they will soon be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreign minister said he understands that there was to be
a unified command,'' Albright said. ``He also said this was a
preliminary step so that if and when they become part of the
international security presence today, they will be in a position
to deploy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Albright was so concerned about the confusion within the
Russian ranks that she asked Talbott, who had just completed
several days of talks here, to return to Moscow for urgent
consultations on the command issue. Talbott remains in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ivanov's assurance, Russia remains deeply unhappy over
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the way the alliance is managing
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin said Friday that relations with NATO
would remain frozen. And the Russian foreign minister said Friday
night that Moscow would never agree to a command arrangement in
which its troops are ``subordinated'' to NATO officers.
</P>
<P>
   One fear, a Russian official said Friday night, is that NATO
peacekeepers will enter Kosovo and spread out through the province.
By the time a solution for the command problem is found, the
Russian peacekeepers would be superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are concerns that if NATO enters Kosovo first there
might be no place left for other forces,'' the Russian official
said. ``We will be begging for some place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at NATO's stance, Ivanov hinted in a television
interview Friday night that Russian troops might not participate in
the peacekeeping force if the command issue is not worked out.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a major setback for the Clinton administration's
efforts to involve Moscow in a Balkan settlement and restore
American-Russian relations.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov's comment may have been intended to increase the pressure
on NATO to work out a compromise. Still, it was a less worrisome
form of pressure than Ivashov's brinksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was not the first time that the Russian military appeared
to have chartered its own foreign policy on Kosovo. After the
Russian special envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin, returned from his
mission to Belgrade with the Finnish president, Ivashov assailed
the accord as a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin later intervened to support a settlement. Ivashov,
however, not only kept his position; he led the Russian delegation
in the talks Friday on command arrangements for peacekeepers in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration sought to put the best
face on the surprising Russian troop movements and the seemingly
intractable issue of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work it out,'' President Clinton said.

ECONOMIC VIEW: A MARSHALL PLAN, ON THE CHEAP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 13)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When George Marshall died in 1959 he left strict
instructions: No eulogies. But getting politicians to follow
commands, even those issued by former generals, is tricky business.
And these days nearly everyone is paying homage to the Marshall
Plan, which rebuilt Europe and Japan after World War II and became
the gold standard for reconstructing some very deconstructed
corners of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the foreign
ministers of Europe were talking about a ``Marshall Plan for the
Balkans.'' It will be a main subject of discussion at the annual
summit meeting of industrialized nations later this week in
Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, an agreement is expected on whether and how
to forgive the debts of some of the world's poorest nations, which
owe upwards of $130 billion in loans that they can probably never
repay. Lifting that burden, advocates say, amounts to a Marshall
Plan for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the term is no surprise: Congress despises foreign
aid almost as much as it loves phantom tax cuts. But call it a
Marshall Plan, and suddenly it's not a handout, but a noble effort
to turn beaten, bombed-out, or broke nations into models of
democratic capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one real difference: The politicians who invoke the
terminology these days are not really interested in paying
Marshall-sized money.
</P>
<P>
   By most estimates, the Marshall Plan cost about 2 percent of
America's gross national product each year from 1947 to 1951. If
the same ratio were used today, after the biggest run-up in
national wealth in a century, the United States would spend $160
billion a year on modern Marshall Plans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the talk is of spending only a tiny fraction of that
figure, perhaps forgiving a bit more than $600 million for the
poorest nations, assuming they meet a number of reform conditions
that many have resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that true Marshall Plans are not big sellers
these days. During the Cold War they carried a strategic logic of
their own, shoring up economies so that nations would not be
tempted to spread communism. They also helped American industry by
creating export markets. But in the post-Cold War era, there is far
less enthusiasm for spending money to encourage countries to adopt
Western-style capitalism, much less to become customers.
</P>
<P>
   So the same countries that are enthusiastic about new Marshall
Plans talk even more enthusiastically about how to make others pay
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs barely stopped dropping on Belgrade last week before
the NATO allies began jockeying about who would pick up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows it's going to be expensive, but it has to be
done,'' Ms. Albright said. Then, in background briefings, U.S.
officials said that the United States had borne most of the cost of
prosecuting the war, so Europe ought to pay to rebuild Kosovo and
aid Albania and Macedonia. The price tag gyrates from $5 billion to
$100 billion, depending on whether people are talking just about
rebuilding roads and power lines and the like or about a wholesale
economic upgrade for the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the real arm-wrestling is taking place over debt forgiveness
for the poorest nations, chiefly in Africa. It's one of those ideas
that everyone agrees on in general but almost no one can agree on
in specific.
</P>
<P>
   No one thinks debt service should be allowed to keep gobbling 60
percent or more of destitute countries' budgets. But neither is
there much support for 100 percent debt forgiveness, no strings
attached. The International Monetary Fund and others fear that
simply writing off debts creates a serious ``moral hazard'' _ the
expectation that future borrowing need not be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, describing the
American position last week, talked about step-by-step debt relief
in return for real economic reforms _ more openness, enforceable
property rights, revamped banking systems _ akin to those asked of
South Korea, Indonesia, Russia and others in return for IMF
bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is figuring out who pays. The French and the
Japanese, who have done the most country-to-country lending, like
the idea that Western nations would contribute in proportion to the
size of their economies _ meaning the United States would pay the
most. Washington, not surprisingly, has a different formula in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups fear that debt forgiveness will cannibalize other
aid. ``We want to see as much debt relief as possible,'' said Lydia
Williams, a policy adviser at Oxfam America, who has been lobbying
Congress for a bigger package, but ``it has to be additional, new
resources to do much good.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jeffrey D. Sachs of Harvard points out, after an astounding
boom, the West could afford to solve the problem ``without
resorting to the kinds of huge numbers'' involved in the Marshall
Plan. ``It's just a matter of political will,'' he said _ which
Marshall had less trouble gathering.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of drift and disarray, the National
Rifle Association finds itself right where many of its leaders want
it to be: under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has found new life, members and money through
mass mailings that portray gun owners and sportsmen as being under
siege. Two weeks after the last funeral for a victim in the high
school shootings at Littleton, Colo., the NRA sent letters to its
2.6 million members, warning that President Clinton would ``demand
that you pay the price for the insanity of the killers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the threat of new gun control measures being voted next
week by the House of Representatives, checks are flowing into the
organization, which for decades had been one of the most
influential and feared single-issue advocacy groups. Its members
have hit congressional offices with a blizzard of e-mail messages
and phone calls opposing new gun restrictions. At the state level,
the rifle association is pushing legislation to prohibit municipal
lawsuits against the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s, the NRA has been struggling with a heavy
debt, rebellions within its ranks and declining membership and
revenues. Its image was battered after the Oklahoma City bombing,
when the group was accused of being a bastion for right-wing
extremists, and again after a recent series of school shootings
that have helped transform the gun-control debate into a children's
safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   Its vaunted ability to win elections and oust enemies came into
question when several of its closest congressional allies lost
races last year. And in April, the NRA failed to persuade Missouri
voters to approve a pro-gun ballot referendum, despite spending
$3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since Littleton, the 127-year-old association
asserts that its membership has grown by tens of thousands and that
its contributions have increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The new money will bolster a $20 million lobbying and political
fund that the group uses to lavish campaign contributions on its
loyal supporters, and to punish its enemies in state and federal
elections across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, the group, through its sophisticated
direct-mail and phone banks operations, has mobilized its members
to call and write their congressional representatives, who are
considering the most comprehensive set of gun-control initiatives
since the assault-weapons ban in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The barrage seems to be working. In recent days, many members of
the House have stiffened their resolve to oppose any new
gun-control measures. And some of the precise provisions that the
NRA has demanded _ provisions that would weaken the bills _ have
already appeared in House Republican versions of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity is not our worst enemy,'' said James Jay Baker, the
organization's chief lobbyist. ``Our obituary has been published
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, the NRA will face a crucial test of its
influence in Washington as the House votes on several gun-control
measures like requiring background checks of gun buyers at gun
shows and raising the minimum age for buying a gun to 21 from 18.
</P>
<P>
   But Capitol Hill is just one of several battlefronts for the NRA
It is working in state legislatures across the country against new
gun restrictions and for bills that would prohibit cities from
suing gun manufacturers (to date, more than a dozen cities have
filed such suits). Its leadership is struggling to balance between
conservatives who think the group has been too conciliatory and gun
company executives who think that it has been too uncompromising.
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, the organization is trying to counter what it
considers unfairly negative portrayals of it in the national media
_ like Rosie O'Donnell's recent criticism of one of her guests,
actor Tom Selleck, for supporting the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the group can juggle so many
conflicts at a time when its resources are already spread thin and
its membership has dipped precariously close to a 20-year low
point. To its loyal members, the answer is clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rallying cause,'' said former Rep. Gerald Solomon, a
lifetime NRA member from New York. ``They rally together just like
the Serbs support Milosevic, because they think their country is
being attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the association needs to fight many political and
legal battles, its resources are strained. In the 1990s, the
association spent more than it took in every year except two,
according to a review of the group's tax returns from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The organization has also suffered steadily declining
membership, from a high of 3.5 million in 1995 to 2.6 million now.
Some dissatisfied members attribute the membership decline to the
group's moderation of some of its positions.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the lobbyist, defended the group's decision to accept
some modest gun-control measures in the House bill to be voted on
next week. ``I just think that the political realities of the
situation that we find ourselves in, between the Congress and the
media, has dictated that we have to roll up our sleeves and come up
with a responsive proposal or there are going to be no gun shows,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite its numerous internal problems, the NRA still commands
respect among legislators all over the country. As almost any
member of Congress can attest, the association's power derives from
its large campaign war chest, its sophisticated lobbying and its
national network of organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the NRA contributed more than $4 million to
congressional campaigns and spent an additional $1.5 million
lobbying Congress. Its political action committee ranked with trial
lawyers and doctors as one of the most generous special interest
groups. In October 1998, the NRA's Political Victory Fund spent
more than $1.6 million for radio advertisements in 42 closely
contested House and Senate races. Just since last month's Senate
vote, the group has spent more than $1 million on phone banks and
mailings. And in the last week, it has been running radio ads in
the districts of conservative Democrats, urging them to vote
against new gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   At its headquarters in Fairfax, Va., the group employs 75 people
in its political division, the Institute for Legislative Action.
And through its Web site, mailings, three magazines and
affiliations with more than 100 gun-rights groups, the organization
keeps in close touch with hundreds of thousands of gun owners
beyond its own membership.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate approved gun control measures last month,
the vote still offered clear evidence of the NRA's influence. All
of the top recipients of its campaign contributions over the last
five years voted against the restrictions, says a study by the
Center for Responsive Politics. Those senators included Rick
Santorum, R-Pa., $19,700; James Inhofe, R-Okla., $17,350; John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., $14,850, and Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., $11,450.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the NRA maintains strong institutional links to
Congress. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., sit
on the group's 76-member board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, many incumbents say they fear the rifle association
because it has a long record of turning against lawmakers who buck
it just once, and has a long memory for perceived transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., who retired in 1997, said he
infuriated the NRA in 1961 by proposing a bill in the state
Legislature that would have made it illegal to leave a loaded rifle
or shotgun in an unattended, unlocked vehicle. The NRA killed the
bill and then opposed him _ unsuccessfully _ every time he ran for
office in the next three decades, Pryor said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., an NRA ally who is
considering voting for some new gun restrictions, found his
district flooded with letters from the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you keep taking our heads off, don't count on us to be
there,'' Stupak said he told the NRA officials. ``But,'' he added,
``the fear factor is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a perception in Congress that the association can
defeat even entrenched incumbents, and members often cite the case
of former Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas. A staunch NRA supporter for 40
years, Brooks lost its support in 1994 when he voted for a crime
bill that included an assault weapons ban. Later that year, he lost
his race for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not reliable,'' Brooks said. ``If you are not 110
percent for them, then they are against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Baker, the association's chief lobbyist, said that the
group would continue to single out pro-gun control legislators by
giving tens of thousands of dollars to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But that record is mixed. Last year, two of its strongest
allies, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Sen. Lauch Faircloth,
R-N.C., were defeated, even though the group pumped more than
$400,000 into the two campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the NRA's fearsome reputation rests on its aggressive
lobbying presence in all 50 state capitals and its ability to
mobilize gun owners to vote in even minor state and local
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In its major effort of the past year, the NRA has also succeeded
in getting 10 states to enact laws prohibiting cities from filing
lawsuits against the gun industry. Similar bills are awaiting
governors' signatures in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But the group has clearly lost ground in some states, even as it
increases its spending. Earlier this year, it had a big setback in
Missouri, where it spent $3.7 million in support of a referendum to
allow legal gun owners to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   More than defeats at the ballot box, the anti-gun oratory after
the Littleton shootings has enraged, and activated, NRA members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun owners tend to respond when they feel threatened,'' said
Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation. ``And
they feel more threatened right now than ever.''  &QL;

THE MICROCHIP, AN OWNER'S BEST CHANCE OF FINDING A LOST DOG

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODINVILLE, Wash. _ Wilbur ran away one day last summer.
Distraught, Debbie and Jim Pittman tried everything to find him.
They put up ``lost dog'' fliers on hundreds of telephone poles, and
they checked with nearly every pound around Puget Sound. Nothing.
``But we never gave up hope,'' said Mrs. Pittman. ``We knew he had
his microchip.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of the blue one recent day, 11 months after the black
Labrador disappeared, a call came. ``My heart leapt,'' said Mrs.
Pittman. ``I 911'ed Jim on his beeper right away. I told him,
`Honey, Wilbur's coming home.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Pittmans' dog had been found, and a scan by Hooterville, a
local pet shelter, turned up the tiny microchip that had been
implanted inside Wilbur when he was a puppy. Embedded in the chip
was a 10-digit number linked to a national database with
information about the dog, including the Pittmans' telephone
number.
</P>
<P>
   The microchip involved in Wilbur's high-tech, homeward-bound
journey is not new gadgetry _ as far back as 10 years ago, the
Marin Humane Society in Northern California became the first
shelter in the country to implant the chips in all animals put up
for adoption and since then, the technology has reunited more than
1,000 pets _ 820 dogs, 340 cats and one rabbit, to be exact _ with
their owners there.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice has taken off in recent years, as the three big
manufacturers have tried to overcome proprietary squabbles and move
toward an industry standard, and as many humane societies and
veterinarians have urged pet owners to implant their pets with the
identification devices.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1.6 million American pets now have these chips in their
shoulders and dozens of shelters, including the n one in Manhattan
run by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, have them automatically implanted when animals are
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who see all this microchipping of pets as a sign
of premillenial excess, and the Whole Dog Journal, a newsletter for
holistic dog care based in Greenwich, Conn., reported late last
year that many pet owners were bothered by the creepy `` `Big
Brother' aspects'' of the practice and refused to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is an ethical problem posed by the fact that the
microchip technology, which operates roughly like a grocery market
scanner, actually works extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   The chips, the size of a grain of rice, implanted painlessly and
within seconds, could be used in humans, posing obvious
invasion-of-privacy issues versus some very real benefits: no more
baby mix-ups in the hospital, a powerful new tool to track down
kidnapped children, runaway teen-agers, or even deadbeat dads.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pittmans are just happy to have Wilbur home.
</P>
<P>
   Just what happened to the dog in the past year, and to the
old-fashioned dog tags that had been around his neck, remains a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur seems to have been well-cared for. A few weeks ago,
Wilbur apparently ran away again, and he was found wandering around
a park-and-ride station in Bothell, which, like Woodinville and the
Pittmans' hometown of Redmond, is just east of Lake Washington in
the Seattle area.
</P>
<P>
   Two youngsters who found Wilbur took him home. ``The kids said,
`Maybe there's a microchip inside, let's have him scanned,' '' said
Mrs. Pittman, a nail specialist for a salon in Kirkland, Wash. `The
mother said, `I've never heard of it, but OK' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many shelters now implant the chips for free or a nominal fee.
They still recommend traditional identification tags as part of a
``belt and suspenders'' approach to pet protection, said Stephen
Zawistowski, senior vice president and science adviser at the
ASPCA.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike tags, which can fall off or be removed, or tattoos, which
can fade or be covered up as hair grows, the microchips are
virtually unalterable.
</P>
<P>
   The chip technology was first used in this country to monitor
salmon, and has been used for wildlife research and to counter
ostrich rustling. But it has caught on for domestic pets, spurred
in part several years by a bizarre epidemic of kidnappings of pets
for ransom that garnered wide attention in Southern California. In
one 1993 case, a widow in Corona del Mar agreed to leave $2,500 in
a phone booth for the safe return of her toy poodle, Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year, the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services
announced that it would like to see every pet in the city
microchipped as part of a campaign to reduce the 60,000 times a
year when it had to euthanize stray or lost animals, although
officials said they would not require the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something spooky about it,'' a senior official said
at the time, ``and everyone realizes it.''
</P>
<P>
   The implants so far are still in just a fraction of the 120
million domestic dogs and cats in the country. But spokesmen for
the companies that make the three main products in use _ HomeAgain,
Infopet, and Avid (for American Veterinary Identification Device)
_- say they believe use of the chips will take off as more and more
people become aware of them and scanning of lost animals becomes
standard practice.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, somewhere in the country, pets are reunited
with their owners because of the chips. In Marin County, where all
field services trucks are equipped with hand-held scanners,
``people are so grateful, they'll say this saved my cat or my dog's
life,'' said Jason Willett, a spokesman for the humane society.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, for one, is back home at the Pittmans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take him to the dog park, and he won't go 20 feet without
turning around and looking for us,'' said Mrs. Pittman of her dog,
who will soon be 2 years old. ``He's always checking. Now he
doesn't want us to leave his sight.''

CLINTON CELEBRATES ETHNIC DIVERSITY, HIS POLICIES AND THE B-2
BOMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, Mo. _ President Clinton came to the
home of the B-2 stealth bomber to extol American air power Friday,
but he devoted as much of his speech to praising American-style
race relations, asserting that NATO's victory in Kosovo had been
one of ethnic diversity over ``ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told a racially-mixed crowd of about 3,000 Air Force
personnel and their families, gathered in a cavernous hangar, that
their example was helping to refute the idea that ``a country can
only be great with everybody just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I invite the people of this world today who say that people
cannot get along across racial and ethnic and religious lines to
have a good look at the United States military, to have a good look
at the members of the United States Air Force in this hangar
today,'' Clinton said, his back to a bat-winged B-2 bomber. ``We
have proved that when people are bound together by shared values,
their differences make them stronger and make our communities
stronger,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Friday's event had the feel of a victory lap for
Clinton, who had been criticized in some quarters for maintaining
that air power alone could force concessions from President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. At one point, Clinton
triumphantly contrasted the criticism aimed at him in the United
States with the lack of dissent in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who addressed the crowd before
Clinton, even said, ``This is an `I told you so' day.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Air Force, Friday's event also seemed intended to
showcase the B-2 as the military's newest technological marvel, and
not the over-priced fiasco that some critics had once asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The arrowhead-shaped planes, which are designed to reduce radar
detection, cost more than $2 billion each, making them the most
expensive aircraft ever built. The bombers made their combat debut
in the air war over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has 10 of the planes, all of which are based at
Whiteman, 75 miles east of Kansas City. Six of the planes took part
in airstrikes over Yugoslavia, flying a total of 50 missions.
Though that accounted for just 1 percent of NATO's sorties, the
B-2s dropped 11 percent of all the bombs in the conflict, Clinton
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was a B-2 that dropped the satellite-guided 2000-pound bomb
that mistakenly hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three
people. But the error was the result of faulty maps, American
military officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more surreal aspects of the war, the B-2s remained
based at Whiteman throughout the conflict, allowing the two-man
crews to fly 31-hour round-trip missions over the Balkans _
refueling four times in the process _ and still sleep in their own
beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilots, the crews, the weaponeers, the maintenance
personnel who are part of the B-2 team stationed here at Whiteman
should take special pride in proving what a truly remarkable
aircraft can do,'' Clinton told the crowd, which cheered and waved
little American flags. ``As far as we know, they still don't know
you were there.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his nationally televised speech on Thursday night,
Clinton emphasized that difficult and dangerous challenges still
remain in defending the peace in Kosovo. And he called the conflict
``a defining moment'' for NATO in particular and Western
democracies in general.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Milosevic, Clinton said, ``He thought open societies
with free dissent _ where, as you know, everybody in America was
free to tell me I was wrong about this from the get-go _ he thought
that made us weak. But he turned out to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as defending his handling of the war, Clinton also
seemed intent on articulating to the American heartland why this
war thousands of miles away was important to their lives, and why
the nation should feel triumphant about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's victory would have been a license for despots
around the world to deal with ethnic minorities simply by murdering
or expelling them from their land,'' he said. ``But instead, we end
the 20th century and begin a new one with a respect for human
rights and human dignity and international law.''
</P>
<P>
   And he concluded by quoting a son of Missouri, President Harry
Truman, who said near the end of World War II, ``It is easier to
remove tyrants and destroy concentration camps than it is to kill
the ideas which gave them birth and strength.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House prepares to vote next week on the
politically explosive issue of gun control, congressional aides say
the National Rifle Association remains potent enough to doom the
modest measures passed by the Senate, despite the public's embrace
of restrictions since the Colorado school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, in fact, continues to enjoy so much clout that House
Republican aides agreed to work privately with its lobbyists this
week to accommodate some of their concerns as the legislation was
drafted, according to GOP aides and the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   While the NRA did not get exactly what it wanted, the lobby's
influence during the early stages of House discussions on gun
control has reversed the prevailing opinion that pronounced the gun
lobby weakened after last month's defeats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our epitaph has been written many times,'' said Jim Manown, an
NRA spokesman, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say the NRA's power, in the form of campaign
contributions as well as a voting bank of 2.9 million members, has
hampered the Republican Party's attempt to remake its pro-gun image
as the presidential election approaches. And though no one is sure
how the House vote will go, the partisan fight could sink the
overall $1.5 billion juvenile violence bill that contains the gun
provisions, congressional aides say.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert announced this week that he will
not pressure GOP lawmakers on the gun-control measures and will let
the House ``work its will'' on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even within our conference there are two or three
different points of view, and legitimately so,'' said Hastert, an
Illinois Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Friday by the US Conference of Mayors, Hastert
was urged to pass tougher legislation raising the legal age of gun
buyers from 18 to 21, and requiring higher age restrictions for all
firearms buyers and background checks for all customers at gun
shows. Hastert favors such background checks and other measures
aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of children.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's two-pronged lobbying strategy, which was advertised on
the Internet, in mainstream newspapers, and all over Capitol Hill,
began two months ago with a campaign that questioned the wisdom of
passing new gun-control laws when the Clinton administration is not
enforcing existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   In one advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, the NRA wrote
that the government prosecuted only 37 cases where felons bought
firearms through straw purchases, 11 cases where individuals
provided guns to juveniles, and 11 cases of juveniles caught with
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``More firearms legislation, like previous legislation, that is
passed with no intention of enforcement is a dangerous fraud,'' the
ad said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it could not comment on particular
prosecutions but defended its record, pointing out that combined
state-federal prosecutions of gun crimes were up 22 percent since
1992. The number of federal cases in which an offender is sentenced
to more than five years also rose 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many Republicans took up these arguments to defeat
stronger gun-control provisions and to add measures to their
gun-control proposal, such as requiring the attorney general to
assign federal prosecutors specifically to enforce gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure of the Clinton administration to prosecute federal gun
crimes is unconscionable at this critical time,'' said Oklahoma
Representative J.C. Watts, in a statement for the House Republican
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the NRA's strategy has been promoting the
idea that the Senate's gun-control measures would hamstring gun
sellers and buyers in a maze of red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would ``impose a cradle-to-grave massive federal
regulatory scheme on gunowners throughout America,'' read a letter
the NRA encouraged its members to send to their representatives.
</P>
<P>
   These arguments showed up as House GOP members drafted a bill
that would ease record-keeping requirements by gun sellers and
gun-show promoters, make tracing of guns more difficult, and narrow
the definition of a gun show, so that vendors at small gatherings
and flea markets would be able buy and sell guns without conducting
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and congressional Democrats immediately
denounced the House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their legislation is a total joke that effectively does
nothing for gun control,'' said Julian Epstein, the Democratic
counsel on the House Judiciary Committee. ``It is the NRA version
of the bill, and there's absolutely no doubt about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates such as Kristen Rand, director of federal
policy for the Violence Policy Center, a Washington gun-control
research group, argued that the Republican proposal would gut the
Senate bill, which would mandate background checks on the
purchasers of all firearms sold at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Republican bill you could have individuals offering
thousands of guns for sale by nine vendors, and no background
checks,'' Rand said about the House proposal. The measure would
change the Senate definition of a gun show from a place where 50 or
more guns are sold to a place where 10 or more vendors gather,
regardless of the number of guns sold.
</P>
<P>
   But Repubicans dismissed the notion that they are beholden to
the NRA, and they accused Democrats of threatening the entire
juvenile justice bill to create a political issue for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee charged with drafting the Republican
leadership's measure, said he is seeking legislation with a
realistic chance of passing the House, where pro-gun forces have
traditionally been strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation that the NRA wrote this legislation is
nonsense,'' said Hyde, who said he never met with NRA
representatives though his staff did. Hyde said that most of the
four provisions in the new bill mirror the Senate's proposal, which
the NRA opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the NRA's involvement so far, it is far from clear how
the gun-control issue will be decided in the House. Between 160 and
180 members firmly oppose gun control, and that includes about 40
conservative Democrats from states such as Michigan and Texas,
according to congressional aides. There are a similar number of
swing Republicans who support tougher restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to assuage party conservatives, some Republicans
are trying to write a weaker version of Hyde's proposal, but
moderate Republicans and Democrats are unlikely to support that.
Meanwhile, a vote on the Senate's version is expected to be
extremely close. At the end of the day, congressional aides say,
both proposals could fail.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has spent $750,000 on a mailing campaign and $300,000 on
a phone bank operation to generate opposition since the Senate's
action, according to the NRA's Manown. He said that once the NRA
illustrated that its clout had not diminished, the group began
working with the Republican aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to influence the legislative process comes from
the strength of our members,'' Manown said. ``We urge them to
contact their elected representatives and voice their opinions,
which is something they do outstandingly well.''

COMMENTARY: WHEN PRAISE IS DUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY LEWIS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Bill Clinton held firm. That was a crucial fact in the
Kosovo war, and it should be recognized. Under savage criticism at
home and abroad, the President stuck to his policy. And it
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Right up to the denouement, critics predicted that the President
would weaken his demands on Yugoslavia. A writer in The Times of
London, Ben Macintyre, wrote: ``Clinton is seeking a diplomatic
escape route that will allow him to cut his losses and save face.
... It is the  &UR; modus operandi &LR;  of a man whose primary instincts are
to vacillate, compromise and then gloss.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Clinton has often abandoned positions in the
past when the going got rough. But this time he abandoned nothing.
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian tyrant, had to eat every one of the
terms set out by Clinton and NATO, including withdrawal of all
Serbian forces from Kosovo, and its occupation by an international
force with NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was also firm in dealing with Russia, aided by
the skillful diplomacy of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
The United States and its allies coaxed and pressed the Russians to
accept the NATO terms, including a call for international
cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal and its indictment of
Milosevic. That left Milosevic nowhere to turn, and he capitulated.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great mistake to forswear ground forces at the start,
and to hold back the really damaging air strikes for weeks. When
the serious bombing came, Milosevic yielded.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton proved right in his belief that an air war alone
could do the job. And he did not shy, in the end, from giving the
orders to strike at such critical targets as the Serbian electric
power system.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the highly regarded military historian and defense
editor of The Daily Telegraph in London, admitted gracefully last
week that he had been wrong in saying _ along with most military
experts _ that air power alone could not win the war. He added:
``If Milosevic really is a beaten man, all other would-be
Milosevics around the world will have to reconsider their plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who had criticized the president were not so generous in
recognizing his success. That is an understatement. Political
hatred of Clinton is so intense that it seems to turn judgment into
psychopathology. One far-right American commentator said the peace
``resembled the president who will embrace it. Both are without
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, with such notable exceptions as John McCain and Bob
Dole, put partisan politics ahead of patriotism. A year ago, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said, ``Something must be done'' to
protect Kosovo civilians from Milosevic _ ``We cannot allow this
slaughter to continue.'' But when Clinton acted, Lott said, ``Give
peace a chance'' _ and joined most Republicans in opposing the war.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, under the leadership of Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, were the disloyal opposition. They were more interested in
scoring points against the president than in stopping a mass
murderer's atrocities. Conservatives tried to cut off all funds for
U.S. forces in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Having criticized the Kosovo conflict as ``Clinton's war,'' some
conservatives then attacked the president for not insisting on a
more complete victory _ including the overthrow of Milosevic, which
could not have been achieved without a large-scale ground war.
Oliver North, on his radio talk show, asked, ``Can anybody out
there tell me who won?''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who really doubts that NATO and the United States won
this war should consider what it would look like if Milosevic had
succeeded in holding out and NATO had been forced to water down its
terms. Of course it will take a lot more steel in the backbone of
Clinton and other NATO leaders to keep the Serbian dictator down
and see that the refugees actually get back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   After the impeachment struggle, some thought Clinton should be
written off as a lame duck. That notion is now reminiscent of the
prediction made by a French general after France fell to the Nazis
in World War II: ``In three weeks, England will have her neck wrung
like a chicken.'' To which Winston Churchill responded: ``Some
chicken! Some neck!''

FBI TEAM GOING TO KOSOVO THIS WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Great Britain, France)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An advance team of FBI agents will go to Kosovo
this weekend to assess the forensic needs of the international
authorities who are about to start the most thorough inquiry into
war crimes since World War II, federal law-enforcement officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This week, an administration official recounted, the chief
prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, asked the United States to contribute
crime-scene experts; videotape, photographic and mapping
specialists; explosives and ballistics experts, and forensic
pathologists.
</P>
<P>
   At The Hague, Netherlands, on Friday, Ms. Arbour's deputy,
Graham Blewitt, said that the first investigators would enter
Kosovo early next week, one step behind the first wave of
international security forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the
tribunal would ask countries to lend 300 forensic specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the findings of the advance team, officials here
said, the FBI will probably send more than 25 people to the region.
The initial goal will be to conduct preliminary investigations and
recommend which crimes should be investigated further.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here said U.S. intelligence information like satellite
photographs would be extensively used to guide investigators to the
sites of presumed atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   The initial focus will be guided by photographic intelligence
and interviews with refugees, officials said. They added that early
attention would be given to the seven locations identified as the
scenes of mass executions in the indictment on May 27 of President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and four political and military
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Europe said speed was essential to seal
off the sites where mass murder, torture and other crimes were
suspected before evidence could be destroyed or tampered with, and
to interview witnesses while incidents were fresh in their minds.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, showed photographs
this week that he said indicated that Yugoslav forces had bulldozed
a mass grave in Izbica in western Kosovo in an attempt to destroy
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   A team of eight forensic experts from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police has been assigned to work for a month gathering evidence in
Kosovo for the tribunal, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of Canada
said.
</P>
<P>
   In London, a spokesman for the government said Britain would
provide a team of 15 forensic specialists. France will contribute
at least 12 ballistics experts, forensic doctors and police
photographers, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, government officials and refugee and relief
organizations have been conducting interviews and passing out
questionnaires at the Kosovo borders to glean information about
possible war crimes and to prepare lists of witnesses who might
testify in trials in The Hague. Refugees who have relocated to
Western Europe have also been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In France and the Netherlands, special attention is being paid
to cases of sexual attacks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a few months, the United States and its allies will have to
decide how much money they are prepared to pay to finance the
inquiries. The tribunal budget for the calendar year 1999 was
prepared last fall, before the Kosovo conflict began. With the
support of Congress, the Clinton administration has sent an
additional $9 million to the voluntary trust fund of the tribunal
to help meet expenses for the second half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has not prepared its budget for 2000. Officials
said the United States would obviously be asked to pay millions
more than it did this year.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the investigations in Kosovo would be
much more thorough and extensive than they were in Bosnia in 1995.
In part, that is because NATO forces will be in control in Kosovo,
and investigators will be free to go where their searches take
them. Another reason is that most atrocities in Kosovo were
committed in the last three months, making evidence and testimony
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, investigators met strong resistance in the regions
under Bosnian Serb control. Some atrocities in Bosnia were
committed as 1992. And even later crimes, like the massacre at
Srebrenica, were not explored until months after they had been
committed, leaving considerable time for tampering with evidence.

 _ SF CHRON   Hot Water, Cold Cash _ How Roy Jacuzzi turned family business 
 into global bath empire 
 &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
For a guy whose name is associated with bubbles, steam and nudity,
Roy Jacuzzi is surprisingly unassuming.
<P>
   The suit-clad, gray-templed Jacuzzi lives quietly in a
91/2-bathroom house in Contra Costa County. Every morning the
55-year-old executive watches the news in his $10,000 J-Allure
shower/steam bath with a built-in television set. Then he drives to
the headquarters of Jacuzzi Inc. in Walnut Creek, where he runs a
global bath empire founded decades ago by his immigrant forebears.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlpool bath business, far from drying up with the
encounter-group culture of the 1970s, has never been better. And
Roy Jacuzzi _ who was the first to sell whirlpools for purposes of
leisure, rather than therapy _ has been riding the wave for more
than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Jacuzzis have been engineering innovators since the turn of
the century, when Roy Jacuzzi's grandfather, Joseph, and Joseph's
six brothers immigrated to the East Bay from Pomone, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers had little formal education, but their Albany
company, Jacuzzi Bros., revolutionized aeronautics. Frank,
Valeriano, Rachele, Candido, Giocondo, Gelindo and Joseph Jacuzzi
are honored in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum for
building the first enclosed monoplane.
</P>
<P>
   After a tragic plane accident in 1918, which killed Gelindo and
forced the company into bankruptcy, the brothers redirected their
engineering skills to agricultural irrigation systems, a business
that remains a small part of Jacuzzi Inc. today. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  By the time young Roy joined the company in the mid-1960s,
fresh from the University of California at Berkeley, Jacuzzi Bros.
had begun diversifying into swimming pool pumps and a mobile
hydrotherapy pump that could be used in a bathtub. (The latter was
developed to treat a family member with rheumatoid arthritis.) But
agriculture was still its focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather and his brothers thought I was a little
unusual'' when presented with the idea of installing hydraulic jets
in bathtubs, recalls Jacuzzi, who studied industrial design and
engineering in college.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the project got the go-ahead. In 1968, Jacuzzi began
peddling his first model, the Roman Bath, at home builder and
plumbing trade shows. (Actress Suzanne Somers posed for early
advertisements.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jacuzzi Inc. is a subsidiary of U.S. Industries, a
publicly held consumer-products conglomerate in Iselin, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Jacuzzi, whose goods are sold in more than 100 countries, is
expected to rack up more than $650 million in sales this year and
is aggressively acquiring competitors in the United States and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy is a very smart marketer who certainly understood that the
market was turning in the direction of leisure and fitness and
style and all the stuff that whirlpools are associated with,'' said
Eliot Sefrin, publisher of Kitchen and Bath Design News, a trade
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think the most admirable thing is that he just went out
there and pushed the thing like heck at every trade show he
could,'' said Sefrin. ``It was very entrepreneurial. He really
believed in it.''
</P>
<P>
   To prime the pump for a product that was considered somewhat
bizarre, Jacuzzi gave home builders a great deal: For every $700
whirlpool tub they bought, contractors kept $350. That compared to
a $20 profit on each $100 conventional tub they installed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi took home 50 or 60 orders from his first trade show. At
the time, the whirlpool bath ``was a selling feature that made a
home unique and different,'' said Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   Today _ whether most homeowners actually use them or not _
whirlpool bathtubs are a standard feature in high-end homes. But
the fastest-growing category is under-$1,000 tubs sold at big-box
stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, a segment Jacuzzi entered just
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just stuck to the luxury market and sold through
distributors, you'd be talking flat growth to about 5 percent,''
said Brian Langenberg, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.
``Home centers are pulling in a lot of that business.''
</P>
<P>
   Demand for whirlpool tubs at Home Depot, where they sell for
$350 to $1,000, ``outpaces other (bathroom) fixtures by far,'' said
Gene Boiseau, the retailer's West Coast plumbing merchant.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Americans will install 427,000 whirlpool bathtubs in
new homes and 405,000 in remodelled bathrooms this year, estimates
the National Kitchen and Bath Association.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor whirlpools, known as ``spas,'' are a smaller part of
Jacuzzi's business than the indoor variety. At Home Depot, however,
the sales growth of its spas outpaces that of indoor whirlpools,
according to Boiseau.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast, an area where spas are just catching on, sales
rose 700 percent in the first four months of the year. A stunning
$9 million dollars worth of spas were sold in a Memorial Day
promotion at Home Depot, said Jacuzzi.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jacuzzi Inc.'s biggest problem these days is keeping up
with demand. Just this week, it acquired Gatsby Spa, a $24
million-a-year company, and plans to immediately use Gatsby's
excess plant capacity to fill back orders, Jacuzzi said.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Gatsby and the 1998 purchase of Sundance
Spas, which had been the second-largest spa-maker, Jacuzzi now
accounts for about half of U.S. spa sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi Inc. is able to dramatically reduce costs among its
acquired companies because it can buy raw materials like acrylic
more cheaply as it grows. The company also installs Jacuzzi pump
systems in its new tub lines, many of which had used pumps made by
Jacuzzi rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacuzzi doesn't want to dominate only the whirlpool
business. Fueled by cash from its parent company, it is plotting a
takeover of the whole bathroom _ and the yard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Jacuzzi acquired a Canadian swimming pool company,
Haugh Products, maker of Atlantic-brand pools. That purchase
instantly made Jacuzzi the country's biggest manufacturer of
above-ground pools.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Jacuzzi spent $745 million buying Zurn
Industries, the maker of Zurn- and Elger-brand toilets, kitchen and
bathroom sinks, faucets and drains, items that Jacuzzi had never
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Since the average upscale home is being built with 21/2 baths,
``if you're only selling them a whirlpool for the master suite,
you've got another bath and a half you're not really working
with,'' Jacuzzi explained.
</P>
<P>
   Showers are another important area, since most people prefer
showers to baths for their morning ablutions.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi is spending hefty development dollars on high-end
shower/bath combo systems. For example, the two-person J-Allure
comes with two shower heads, six side jets that shoot water at body
level, steam, a whirlpool bath, a TV, a VCR, a CD player, an AM/FM
radio and four speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The $8,000-to-$10,000 unit is for people with a lot of
``disposable, and I do mean disposable, income,'' observed
Langenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the United States, Jacuzzi operates plants in Europe and
South America, and it opened its first Asian factory in Singapore
last year. Jacuzzi will be well positioned when the economies of
those areas improve, said Jeanette Daly, an analyst with First
Honolulu Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Jacuzzi's major acquisitions have been funded by its
parent, U.S. Industries, which was spun off of Hanson, a British
industrial conglomerate, in 1995. ``The capital from U.S.
Industries has really been a godsend,'' said Jacuzzi. ``I've got
some pretty aggressive objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi said his company's 1999 revenues would be higher than a
$650 million forecast by Langenberg. He declined to be more
specific, but said that with various acquisitions, ``We're well on
our way to being a billion-dollar company.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the billion-dollar goal would put Jacuzzi in the same
league as industry leader Kohler, a privately owned Wisconsin
manufacturer that industry sources estimate sells $1.2 billion of
toilets, sinks and the like each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Kohler as good competition, and getting into toilets
and sinks is a definite opportunity for us to rival Kohler some
more,'' Jacuzzi said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is convinced that Jacuzzi is home free.
``Even though they are No.1 in the world, they are not the most
innovative,'' said Jeffrey Burton, owner of San Francisco's Bath
and Beyond showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Rival manufacturers have begun making tubs that create thousands
of tiny bubbles instead of ``slapping you around with jets,''
Burton said. The bubble tubs are also quieter than Jacuzzi's jet
tubs. Other innovations include underwater lights that change color
and sound-wave therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi said his company has plenty of innovations on the
drawing board, including aroma therapy, ultraviolet tanning, and a
feature that will use warm air to ``dry you like a desert wind''
following a bath or shower.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company makes a small line of bubbling tubs, Roy
doesn't foresee a big future in them. ``It's sort of like getting a
Ferrari with a two-horsepower engine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi has no current  &LR; plans to leave his post as Jacuzzi
Inc.'s chairman, president and chief executive. When he does, there
is no fourth-generation heir apparent. Roy Jacuzzi was the only one
of 257 family stockholders to stay with the company after it was
sold 25 years ago to Walter Kidde &AMP; Co. (which was acquired by
Hanson in 1987).
</P>
<P>
   Jacuzzi's two grown sons, Joseph and Jason, have gone into other
fields. It's too early to tell about Lincoln, 11, or Giordano, 5,
but Giordano is showing good instincts _ he watches cartoons every
morning in the J-Allure.

 _ SF CHRON   Computer Glitch Halts EBay's Auction Service 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A computer glitch caused an all-day outage on eBay's popular
auction service yesterday, disrupting bidding on millions of Beanie
Babies, Barbie dolls, autographed photos of Mother Teresa and other
items.
<P>
   It was one of the largest Internet outages yet in terms of time
out and revenues lost.
</P>
<P>
   EBay is one of the top 10 Internet sites in terms of &LR; 
 &LR; transactions and one of the few that is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose company lets people in 50 countries buy and sell
almost anything online. Ebay gets a commission on every item sold.
It lists up to 2 million items at a time, and claims to get 500
bids per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Even among competing auction sites, which reported increased
business yesterday, there was fear that the eBay hiatus will scare
people away from doing business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned what effects this might have on the entire
e-commerce community,'' said Sharon Greenspan, a spokeswoman for
Seattle-based Amazon.com, the online bookseller that recently added
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some intermittent problems first cropped up Wednesday on eBay,
after the company reorganized its Web site to make it easier to
use.
</P>
<P>
   It shut down entirely at 8 p.m. Thursday and was still
inoperable early last &LR; yesterday evening. During the outage, a team
of 50 engineers struggled to repair corrupted data files.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry, but the eBay system is temporarily unavailable,''
the company said in an online message after service went out
Thursday night. ``We extend our utmost apologies for this
inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   By yesterday morning, though, that message was replaced with a
more cryptic note: ``Damage to the system is more extensive than
expected.'' The company emphasized that no data was lost, and the
outage was unrelated to the ExploreZip.worm virus which spread via
e-mail worldwide this week.
</P>
<P>
   Auctions that were scheduled to end yesterday &UR;  &LR; will be extended
by 48 hours after service is restored, eBay said.
</P>
<P>
   Internet glitches happen all the time, but the eBay blackout is
probably the biggest since America Online was off-line for 19 hours
in August 1996. AOL came under intense fire, but the company made a
concerted effort to improve its reliability and eventually came out
stronger than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can rebound from this the way AOL did a few
years ago,'' eBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said. ``We've got to
make this up to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers who make all or some of their living selling items on
eBay were especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ostrowski of Cincinnati, who made $6,000 last month selling
used books and magazines, said the outage is ``killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   MarGee Charlier, a small-business owner in Kewaunee, Wisc., who
supplements her income by selling antiques on eBay, told the
Associated Press the daylong crash was a ``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers warned that consumers who are still leery
about the reliability of shopping online may be scared off by
problems at eBay, which handles about 80 percent of online
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sellers have their inventories locked in eBay, which not only
hurts them but the entire e-commerce market,'' said Larry Schwartz,
president of AuctionUniverse.com, a competing online auction house
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   AuctionUniverse.com reported an 80 percent in transactions and a
30-percent jump in new memberships the past few days. But in the
long run, Schwartz said, Ebay's problem ``is not good news for any
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly for eBay. In a recent survey by Jupiter
Communications, 46 percent of consumers polled said they will
abandon an e-commerce site with technical or performance problems
and go to a competing site. Of those, about half will eventually go
back to the site they left if the problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auction sites, by nature, have loyal users. But at some point,
people are going to lose their loyalty to eBay and look at other
options like Amazon.com and Yahoo,'' said Fiona Swerdlow, senior
analyst of Jupiter Communications in New York. ``This is a huge
concern to eBay, yet they can't seem to get their arms around it.
They've got to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay has suffered four outages in the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A six-hour shutdown on June 9 prevented the company from hosting
auctions of merchandise from the latest ``Star Wars'' movie.
Customers instead flocked to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Last month eBay stopped auctions on two occasions, for about
seven hours on May 20 and four hours on May 3, because of technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's earned $7 million in profits on revenues of $34 million
in the first quarter of this year. The company, which only went
public in September, has a market value of $20 billion and 3.8
million registered users _ almost twice the membership it had at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   The outage caused eBay's high-flying stock to plunge $16.81, or
9 percent, to $165.88 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   At least one EBay customer was heartened by yesterday's debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This outage is much like a fire drill or power outage during
normal business activity,'' said Roger Rymer of Dallas. ``It brings
you down to Earth and causes you to take a calm look at what you
are really in the midst of. In my mind, it is healthy for all of
us. But when the lights come back on, I'm getting cranked up to
really burn again.''

ONCE AGAIN, WALL STREET WORRIES ABOUT HEDGE FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors stung by falling bond prices and a strengthening
Japanese yen fled the Treasury market Friday, driving the 30-year
bond yield up to 6.16 percent, its highest level since November
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The violent move, from 6.06 percent the previous day, was fed in
part by Wall Street fears that some large investment portfolios
known as hedge funds had encountered a fresh set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The day began rather calmly, with bond investors taking in
stride the increase of 1 percent in retail sales in May and the
rise of 0.2 percent in producer prices reported by the government.
Then, around midday, talk swirled about liquidations by hedge
funds, which are open to wealthy individuals and institutions. This
brought even more sellers to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sellers appeared to be unwinding a type of trade
that has been extremely popular among speculative investors in
recent months, known as the yen-carry trade.
</P>
<P>
   An investor making such a bet borrows funds in Japan at
prevailing interest rates there, which are far lower than those in
the United States, and then uses the money to buy bonds in the
United States. The difference between what investors pay in
borrowing costs and what they receive on their investments has been
alluringly high.
</P>
<P>
   Or it was until Wednesday, when the yen began rallying strongly
against the dollar. Then came the news on Thursday that the
Japanese economy grew 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 1999, the
nation's first growth reading in six quarters. The dollar fell 2.5
percent against the yen in four days of trading.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, U.S. bond prices were falling, and yields
rising, on fears that the Federal Reserve Board would raise
interest rates at its June 30 meeting. So any investor in a
yen-carry trade was losing on both sides of the transaction: the
stronger yen meant less for investors repatriating their funds into
dollars and falling bond prices created losses as well.
</P>
<P>
   Because the yen-carry trade has been so popular among
speculative investors, such as those managing hedge funds for
wealthy clients, the rising yen and declining bond raised the
specter of a financial market dislocation like that caused last
fall by the near-demise of Long-Term Capital Management, a fund run
by John Meriwether, a former Salomon trader.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to hedge-fund fears is the fact that some of the
best-known portfolios have had a poor year, with some investors
abandoning ship. Through June 3, Tiger Management, a hedge fund
with $13 billion run by Julian Robertson, had lost 7.36 percent.
Quantum Fund, the flagship fund overseen by George Soros, was down
14.8 percent as of June 4.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Tiger Management said Friday that the fund had
plenty of ready cash and could cover its investor redemptions four
times over. The fund allows investors to exit only twice a year,
and redemption requests for the latest period were due by May 31.
People on Wall Street said that Tiger had experienced redemptions
of about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to performance problems of its own, the Quantum Fund
of Soros has recently experienced management turmoil. Three
high-level managers left last month, and Soros said at a news
conference Thursday that he expected to hire new managers shortly
to improve the fund's returns.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the firm said that it was also interviewing
candidates to fill the new post of chief executive. The chief would
run the operation and report to Soros.
</P>
<P>
   People in the hedge-fund community may also have been unnerved
by the news that one of the biggest and oldest investors in the
Soros fund was liquidating some holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters reported that Haussman Holdings NV, which manages $3.5
billion for investors, had reduced its Quantum Fund investment to 8
percent of Haussman assets, from 12 percent at the end of 1998.
Hedge-fund watchers say that the Haussman action is significant
because the firm was one of Soros' earliest investors.
</P>
<P>
   With memories of the rescue of Long-Term Capital still fresh,
skittishness about hedge funds is to be expected, particularly
among the banks and brokerage firms that lend to them.
</P>
<P>
   A senior bank executive with knowledge of Quantum Fund's
portfolio said Friday that lenders had very recently looked at the
fund's positions. The lenders came away untroubled, this person
said. Calls to the Soros Fund spokesman for comment were not
returned.

RUSSIAN TROOPS ENTER KOSOVO CAPITAL; SERBS CELEBRATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: More to move ASAP.)

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Breaking assurances given to Washington,
a long column of Russian peacekeeping troops entered Kosovo and its
capital early Saturday morning amid scenes of wild celebration by
local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people packed the streets to welcome the Russian
troops, firing pistols and automatic weapons into the air and
throwing flowers on Russian armored personnel carriers and jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians arrived in a column of some 50 military vehicles
and trucks as NATO peacekeeping forces on the border with Macedonia
prepared to move into kosovo later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The unilateral Russian entry into kosovo is sure to cause a new
crisis with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It came despite promises on Friday from the Russian foreign
minister, Igor Ivanov, that Russian troops would not enter the
southern Serb province before NATO did.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had been shocked by reports that Russian troops from
Russia's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia had moved earlier Friday
through Yugoslavia and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and might be
heading south to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore publicly said the Russians would not move
before NATO did, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
turned his airplane around and headed back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, while seeking to have the
Russians help solve the diplomatic crisis, had failed to negotiate
a serious peacekeeping role for the Russians under the U.N. mandate
authorizing foreign troops to move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had refused to serve directly under NATO command
and had backed Belgrade in insisting that the peacekeepers serve
under a U.N. flag, and not simply as a NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in Pristina fired hundreds of rounds of ammunition
into the air, kissed the Russian soldiers and jumped upon their
armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   They shouted slogans like ``Serbia Russia,'' ''Yeltsin, Yeltsin,
Yeltsin,'' and ``We and the Russians, we are 300 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd shouted insults aimed at the United States
and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers displayed the three-fingered Serb salute before
the column moved off to the south, either toward Pristina's airport
or the Gratanica Monastery, one of the Serbian Orthodox Churches'
holiest sites.

 Deutsche Bank Planning Big Area Buildup  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Aiming to wrest a spot as a Silicon Valley financial power,
Germany's Deutsche Bank, the world's biggest bank, plans a
large-scale buildup of its Northern California investment banking
operations, the bank's top official said.
<P>
   Rolf-E. Breuer, head of the company's spokesman of the  &LR; board of
managing directors, said Deutsche could increase its 260-person Bay
Area securities unit by as many as 90 new employees in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion follows Deutsche's takeover earlier this month of
New York's Bankers Trust, the parent company of BT Alex. Brown, a
midsize investment bank that specializes in raising capital for
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of Alex. Brown's Silicon Valley business ``can't
be overstated,'' Breuer said in an interview in San Francisco.
``It's one of the reasons why we thought Bankers Trust was such a
perfect fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche is already one of the world's leading securities firms.
In Europe, where banking and securities operations haven't been
separated as they were until recently in the United States, the
bank is sort of a combination of Chase Manhattan and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   After mergers in the United States, the buttoned-down world of
banking has often clashed with the more-wide-open investment
banking culture. Alex. Brown staff members have reportedly had a
hard time adjusting after Bankers Trust bought the firm two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of them were not happy in the past,'' Breuer said
of Alex. Brown's staff. ``But I met with enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Deutsche's first foray into Silicon Valley. Earlier
in the decade, it recruited virtually the entire Morgan Stanley
technology team, headed by superstar investment banker Frank
Quattrone.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche soured on the relationship, claiming that  &LR; saying most
of the profits went to Quattrone's team. Last year, the group
jumped ship for a rival firm, Credit Suisse First Boston.

NEW ENGLAND OPENS MINICAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The sun was bright, the air clear. Drew Bledsoe was
throwing passes as well as, if not better than, ever. Terry Glenn
was catching them. Patriots owner Bob Kraft was there, smiling, no
politicians or business writers in sight, and Kraft eyeing a
product that can sell and fill any luxury suite _ his football
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' most important season of football since Bill
Parcells arrived in 1993 began, in a fashion, Friday with the first
day of minicamp. Once again, the Patriots may take a step to the
top of the NFL or they may spiral; many a future depends on which
direction the Patriots go in.
</P>
<P>
   But for two rookies, center Damien Woody and linebacker Andy
Katzenmoyer, this first day of minicamp was a true welcome to
professional football. Woody learned a lesson on how pro football
will be different from college football, courtesy of canny and
tricky defensive lineman Chad Eaton, while Katzenmoyer was peppered
with questions about his academic past, questions that the
linebacker obligingly answered. Past and future mixed and swirled
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked for this day all my life,'' said Katzenmoyer, the
quick linebacker from Ohio State, eager to learn his trade as a
professional. ``I'm here now, and what's done is done. The whole
thing, for me and Ohio State, is over and done with, and it's old
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite.
</P>
<P>
   The matter of the past is that Sports Illustrated's current
issue details apparent preferential treatment given to Katzenmoyer
so he could retain his collegiate eligibility. This, of course,
came as shocking news to no one, as having one rigorous standard
for all students at a university is a relic of an American past
long gone. Some athletes, of course, have been among those students
so favored over the years, from Harvard to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Still in all, appearances must be maintained. So Katzenmoyer was
asked whether the courses he took, courses open to all students,
were easy, and whether he had had his grade changed in one of them,
a spring semester course called Introduction to the Computer and
Visual Arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about that is the classes I took weren't easy,''
said Katzenmoyer, who readily acknowledged his priority at Ohio
State was to play football. In fact, he said, his classes ``started
at 7 a.m. and went to 2 p.m.,'' and then ``from 2 to 8, I had
practice or I was working out. So it wasn't like it was blow-off
classes. Then, after working out, I had to go home and do homework
or write papers.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the grade change, he said it is a common practice among
many students to approach professors to change grades. ``The grade
change? Everybody has a grade change; it's a part of college,''
said Katzenmoyer. ``Any student can get going and talk to a
teacher, and if they feel a grade change is necessary, it's
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Katzenmoyer, he should have worked harder at Ohio
State. He said he hoped ``students who are trying to remain
eligible should work harder and learn from my mistakes.'' The
linebacker said he did not feel singled out for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that I'm picked on,'' he said. ``I guess it's an
example of what kids shouldn't do when they're in college. I mean,
I'll be the first one to take the hit for it.'' In his opinion, he
went on, ``the whole thing was over and done with last summer. I
guess it was something they felt they could use to sell magazines,
and that's fine by me. But to me and my family's opinion, it's over
and done with.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Katzenmoyer said no matter what the New
England coaches or fans expect him to do, ``I'm going to expect
even more of myself.'' He said he was neither frustrated nor hurt
by being taken 28th in the draft ``because I like the situation I'm
in now here.'' The Patriots play an aggressive defense, he said,
``and I'm an aggressive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woody, the rookie center from Boston College and the
Patriots' top draft choice, found himself playing the role of Max
Lane to Reggie White as Eaton quickly taught him how his future
must be: He will have to have his wits about him. Eaton easily
manhandled the rookie on a pass rush with a move ``I never saw
before in college,'' said Woody; namely, grabbing the center's hand
during the rush.
</P>
<P>
   A welcome to the future. For both Damien Woody and Andy
Katzenmoyer. The past is past as of Friday.

$27 MILLION JURY AWARD MAY BE LARGEST MALPRACTICE VERDICT IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The family of a Beaumont woman who was left paralyzed
and severely brain damaged after doctors performed the wrong type
of brain surgery won a $27 million jury verdict this week against
the pathologists who confirmed her misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which does not include any punitive damages, is
believed to be the largest medical malpractice verdict in East
Texas, and perhaps the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a catastrophic mess, what they've done to this
woman,'' said Paul Henderson, the Beaumont lawyer who, along with
David Dies, represented the family of Patricia Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could a young, beautiful woman like that go into the
hospital and come out like this?'' he said. ``It's the worst thing
I've ever seen in my life, and there has been no apology and no
guilt admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The state district court jury of seven men and two women
deliberated for two days before returning its verdict Thursday
against two pathologists, Drs. Alan B. MacDonald and Heinz O.
Zuncker, and Beaumont Diagnostic Pathology Associates, a
now-defunct pathology group that once provided services for St.
Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's surgeon, Dr. Kelly Danks, and several other doctors
named in the lawsuit, as well as the hospital, settled for an
undisclosed sum before trial.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas attorney Ed Quillin, who represented MacDonald and
Zuncker, said Friday that his clients have not decided whether they
will appeal. Zuncker has retired and MacDonald is now working at a
hospital in New York, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the result, obviously, but I respect the
jury's decision,'' Quillin said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her diagnosis in 1994, Taylor, then a 35-year-old
nurse with two small children, had been complaining of blurred
vision in her right eye. After sending her for an MRI test, her
doctors misdiagnosed her illness as being the result of a tumor on
her pituitary gland. Although later tests by other specialists
showed that her pituitary was functioning normally, her surgeons
proceeded to operate June 21, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   During surgery, doctors removed a small sample of what they
believed to be the tumor. MacDonald analyzed the tissue and sent
word back that he had confirmed the diagnosis. The surgeons
continued with the operation, removing Taylor's entire pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the mistake was discovered the next day, Henderson
said, neither Taylor nor her family were told that what had been
removed was a healthy pituitary gland and not a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor awoke from surgery and recognized her husband and
children, but then began to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Brain damage caused by the surgery, and failure to compensate
for the missing pituitary gland, which among other things, controls
the fluid and sodium balance in the body, caused a severe stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's actual problem, which was later diagnosed, was a
meningioma, a benign tumor near her eye that could have been
removed from another location without disturbing the pituitary.
That surgery has a 95 percent chance of full recovery, Henderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Taylor, 40, is bedridden. She is blind in one eye;
paralyzed on one side.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of a pituitary gland, along with severe brain damage, has
left her without the ability to feel satiated even when she has
eaten. The condition has caused her to go from 135 pounds before
her surgery to nearly 500 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   And although she has some understanding of the world around her,
Taylor can only say a few phrases: ``Thank you,'' ``I love you,''
``Help me,'' and the words she repeats most often, ``Finish one.''
The phrase, which doctors speculate is somehow locked in a
continuous loop in her damaged brain, is used to mean anything and
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she sees her children, she says, `Finish one,'''
Henderson said. ``If she wants a drink, she looks at the glass and
says, `Finish one.' If David and I walk into her room and she likes
our ties, she says, `Finish one.' The words are stuck in her brain,
and you can tell what she means by the tone of her voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress of caring for Patricia Taylor caused her husband,
Anthony Taylor, to have a heart attack a few years ago. He
continues to work in the electrical engineering department at Mobil
Oil, and cares for the couple's two children, a 13-year-old boy and
an 11-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Because she needs 24-hour care, and because her cognitive
problems make Patricia Taylor prone to wild mood swings and fits of
rage, she now lives with her 73-year-old mother, her main
caretaker, about a half-mile from her family. Her husband and
children visit every day, Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got the verdict, David and I drove over to her home,''
Henderson said. ``I believe she knows we're her lawyers. We told
her that the jury had given her a good verdict and she hugged each
of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I love you.' She said, `Thank you.'''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slipping through her husband's retirement-plan paperwork two
years ago, Julie Vore thought it invited a simple question. ``I'm a
big fan of no-load funds,'' she remembers thinking. ``Why can't we
have that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vore, 30, a tax lawyer in Columbus, Ohio, whose husband
teaches industrial technology at a suburban high school, just wants
the sort of choices that many Americans take for granted in their
401(k) plans. But her husband's options are limited mostly to
annuities with high fees and funds that carry hefty sales charges _
either of which can only erode the couple's return on their
retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   So she has taken matters into her own hands. She collected 15
account applications from school employees _ the total required
before she could ask the Westerville, Ohio, schools to add low-cost
funds from the Vanguard Group to its plan. Now there is one more
hurdle: The school district will ask Vanguard to sign a contract
taking responsibility for mistakes in handling the teachers'
accounts, a requirement at which Vanguard has often balked in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real irritation,'' Ms. Vore said. ``If I didn't have 30
more years of investing in front of me, I probably would not have
waged this battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vore is hardly alone in doing her homework. As more teachers
learn more about investing, many have become fed up with their
tax-deferred retirement plans, known as 403(b)'s, after the
tax-code section that created them.
</P>
<P>
   The 403(b)'s, which allowed teachers to shelter retirement
income from taxes long before the establishment of 401(k)'s gave
the same advantage to other workers, have now fallen behind through
neglect and inertia. That has prompted some teachers and their
families to become activists, challenging school boards to cut plan
costs and to find better places for teachers to put their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-brainer,'' said Luke Collins, a managing director
of KPMG's investment consulting group, which helped the Chicago
public school system overhaul its 403(b) plan last year. ``If
you've got a retirement system that offers 403(b)'s and it was set
up more than five years ago, chances are you're paying too much in
fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers can count on generous state pensions to help them
through retirement and many others are happy with their choices.
</P>
<P>
   But a great many aren't. Besides incurring high costs in their
plans, teachers must often sort through a bewildering array of
investments with little objective help from their employers,
financial publications or advice on World Wide Web sites. Instead,
they are pitched by sales agents in the teachers' lounge or
cafeteria, much as they were a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance has its costs: Even many teachers who invest
consistently have missed out on the big returns of this decade's
bull market. While more than two-thirds of 401(k) money is invested
in stocks or stock funds, half of 403(b) money is sitting in fixed
annuities, according to Spectrem Group/Access Research, a financial
consulting and research firm based in San Francisco. Such
investments often return little more than bank certificates of
deposit.
</P>
<P>
   But most teachers have sat out the game entirely. Only about two
in five public school teachers even have 403(b) accounts, according
to Spectrem _ in part because only 9 percent of school systems
offer matching contributions, as most companies with 401(k) plans
do. A result is that teachers are passing up a chance to shelter up
to $10,000 a year in retirement savings from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   As teachers and their advocates, like Ms. Vore, are learning, it
doesn't have to be this way. Their efforts are beginning to force
changes in this sleepy but lucrative segment of the financial
services industry. Some bigger school districts are using their
weight to improve their plans, while some insurance companies and
other providers of investment vehicles are lowering fees or
broadening investment options.
</P>
<P>
   And 403(b) investors are taking advantage of the changes,
redeploying their money into stock mutual funds or so-called
variable annuities that have stock funds as their underlying
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The 403(b) market has long been dominated by the insurance
companies, ``but what we're seeing is that it's opening up,'' said
John Barth, a principal in the individual retirement services group
at Vanguard, the nation's second-largest mutual fund company, after
Fidelity Investments. ``Teachers are becoming familiar with the
options because of all of the press, and people reading about
mutual funds, and they are asking their schools to make them
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Some two million public school teachers have about $116 billion
in 403(b) plans, according to Spectrem. (Employees of colleges,
universities, private schools, charitable organizations and
nonprofit hospitals have $350 billion in 403(b) plans, too. But by
and large, benefits consultants say, they tend to have better
plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Annuities, the most common 403(b) investment for public school
teachers, come wrapped with a layer of insurance and extra fees _
including so-called surrender charges that often take away up to 7
percent of a holder's investment if the annuity is sold soon after
purchase. ``Fixed'' annuities promise investors a specified payout
in the future; the returns of ``variable'' annuities depend on the
performance of their underlying assets, usually mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance component, which by itself typically costs 1.25
percent of assets annually, usually offers this guarantee: If, at
the time of the owner's death, the account is worth less than the
contributions into it, the insurer will make up the difference.
Some also guarantee a minimum amount of investment growth.
</P>
<P>
   Fees, though, take a significant bite out of many annuities'
value. The average annuity charges 2.11 percent of assets a year,
according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial researcher,
while the average mutual fund charges about 1.36 percent. Many big
funds that are popular in 401(k) plans are much cheaper; the
Vanguard 500 Index fund is among the cheapest, charging 0.18
percent of assets annually, according to Morningstar. Many other
popular 401(k) funds charge between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent of
assets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers who are lucky enough to have had 403(b) funds invested
in equities during this decade _ even through higher-cost variable
annuities or mutual funds with heavy sales charges _ can be
forgiven for not noticing the fees they have been paying. During
the bull market, most stock-based investments have risen so much
that the effect of high fees hasn't been obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big villain here, ironically, is the bull market,'' said
Collins, the KPMG consultant. ``When the market is up 20 or 30
percent a year, average investors just don't pay attention to
fees.'' (more)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But even a small difference in fees can add up to a huge amount
over a career, because of the power of compound interest.
</P>
<P>
   Here is an example from Steve Butler, an employee benefits
consultant at the Pension Dynamics Corp. in Lafayette, Calif.: A
couple contributes $10,000 a year into a retirement plan through
equal payments twice a month. If their investment earns 10 percent
a year, after fees, they will have $641,000 after two decades and
$1.9 million after three decades. But if their investments earn
just 9 percent, because the annual fees are 1 percent higher, they
will have $75,000 less after 20 years, and $355,000 less after 30.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Leber, a retired Navy captain whose son and daughter-in-law
are public schoolteachers in Maryland, worries that they will lose
more than $100,000 in retirement savings over their careers because
they can't get no-load funds for their 403(b) accounts. He has
called their school benefits office and asked whether the district
could add low-cost funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tugs at my heart knowing my kids are going to lose 25
percent or 30 percent of their nest egg because of these damn
fees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there were no competition for teachers'
retirement savings. Scores of insurance companies compete with one
another to sell annuities to teachers, and the only requirement for
participation in many systems is that the company sign some
documents. Many school districts make no effort to filter out
companies offering poor investments; in fact, some states forbid
school districts from putting up barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pretty much just kick the door open to anybody who wants
to be on the list,'' said Richard Kouri, a former president of the
Texas State Teachers Association who tried to alert teachers to the
pitfalls of some 403(b) plans. ``In most places, there isn't a real
screening process going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance sales representatives ``were pretty much the only
people you would hear from,'' said Melissa Pickeral, who used to
teach in two school districts in the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first time I was approached, I was in my classroom
during my break,'' she said. At her next school, a fellow teacher
called her at home and pitched an annuity. ``I still get phone
calls,'' she said, even though she is no longer teaching.
</P>
<P>
   That traditional marketing structure puts a greater emphasis on
the teacher's relationship with a sales agent than on an
investment's costs or features, according to a study by Cerulli
Associates, a employee benefits consulting firm in Boston.
Insurance companies, it said, pay sales representatives more for
selling retirement products than mutual fund distributors do.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers give high marks to annuities and to the people who
sell them. Some teachers even acknowledge needing a degree of
hand-holding that no-load fund companies _ and even some brokers
who sell load funds (those with sales charges) _ cannot provide.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say the shift by teachers to equities makes an agent's
advice more valuable. ``The market used to be primarily fixed
products, but now you're seeing people really looking for more
variable investments,'' said Barbara Hume, a vice president in the
retirement and savings center of the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co., one of the biggest providers of investments for public-school
403(b) plans. ``They're looking for a lot of advice and
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies also offer advice to investors on topics
like estate planning that fund companies often won't, she added.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Vore has found so far in Ohio, annuity companies and
brokers who sell load funds are often the only providers of 403(b)
investments willing to indemnify school systems from legal
liability if problems arise from improper payroll deductions or
other reasons. Liability has been a growing concern in recent years
as the Internal Revenue Service has increased audits of school
districts to insure that employees are not sheltering too much pay.
(more)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schullo, an elementary school teacher in the Los Angeles
Unified School District, has tried to have Vanguard added to the
district's list of investment options. Now, he said, employees can
buy mutual funds from Vanguard only by going through a state agency
and paying $34 a transaction _ a ludicrously high fee, Schullo
says, for teachers contributing a few hundred dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard would like to become part of the district's plan, but
the fund company won't sign the ``hold harmless'' indemnity
agreement that the schools want. ``I've come up against a very tall
and solid brick wall,'' said Schullo, who gave a presentation on
the problems with 403(b) plans last month at an investment
conference sponsored by The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Most district employees are satisfied with the choices they have
now, said Karen Hemingway, the district's director of contract and
insurance services. The district wants the hold-harmless agreement,
she added, because ``we don't want to take on a liability that we
don't need to.''
</P>
<P>
   In Westerville, the district where Ms. Vore's husband teaches,
Carl Claphan, the treasurer, noted that Ohio law prescribes the
process for adding a new investment company _ including the
requests from teachers and the indemnification agreement.
Officials, he added, have to balance the interests of teachers with
those of taxpayers, and he worries that adding Vanguard could
increase administrative work for the school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want us to use tax dollars efficiently, so we try to do
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though not sure what fees are now paid by teachers through their
403(b) investments or whether it was even possible to have no-load
funds offered in the plan, he said that ``most companies, as far as
I know, do not have exorbitant fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Public school systems are not the only employers to deal with
these issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Malta, Mont., a town of 2,300, the Phillips County Medical
Center revamped its 403(b) plans two years ago, and about 80
percent of eligible employees now participate, according to the
hospital administrator, Larry Putnam. Previously, the hospital had
some load funds in its plan, but it now has no-load funds from
Vanguard, the Janus Capital Corp. and others. The hospital also
holds regular meetings to give employees information about their
options.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said he never considered offering annuities in the
revamped plan. ``Fees are important in any kind of investment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some school districts, too, are finding that they can come up
with plans that protect them legally while giving teachers good
investment choices.
</P>
<P>
   In the Blue Valley School District in Overland Park, Kan., 30
companies were selling products to more than 2,000 district
employees until two years ago, when concerns about compliance with
tax rules prodded officials to narrow the choices to four
companies, said Alan Hanna, the assistant superintendent for human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very confusing,'' he said. ``We would provide employees
a list of companies and phone numbers. They knew they needed to be
investing but were bewildered with what they needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The new program includes two standard annuity companies, since
some teachers still want to ``sit across the kitchen table'' from a
sales agent and are willing to pay for the service, Hanna
explained. But it also offers investments from American Century,
the no-load fund company based in nearby Kansas City, Mo., and
TIAA-CREF, the giant college and university pension system and
financial services concern.
</P>
<P>
   While TIAA-CREF sells annuities, they carry lower expenses than
most mutual funds, have generally strong investment track records
and are well regarded by investment advisers. But serving Blue
Valley is an exception for TIAA-CREF because public school systems
historically have been too decentralized and complex to work with,
said David Shunk, the company's executive vice president in charge
of retirement services. (TIAA-CREF, based in New York, dominates
the 403(b) market for colleges and universities, holding employee
assets of more than $250 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, a revamping of the schools' 403(b) plan is expected
to save employees more than $6 million annually in fees, according
to officials. Previously, teachers paid 2 to 3 percent, on average,
in annual fees on their investments, and more than two-thirds of
their assets were tied up in fixed annuities, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Chicago teachers can buy no-load funds through Prudential
Retirement Services, a unit of Prudential Insurance, or annuities
through the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co., a subsidiary of
the American General Corp. in Houston that is the country's largest
seller of annuities in public schools. Valic has reduced fees and
eliminated surrender charges on many of its annuities. The Valic
plan also allows teachers to buy mutual funds through Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co..
</P>
<P>
   If fed-up teachers alone cannot forge changes in 403(b)'s, they
may have some help from class-action lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach, a law firm that
specializes in shareholder suits, is seeking class-action status
for lawsuits filed against four groups of companies that sell
annuities for retirement plans, including 403(b) plans.
</P>
<P>
   The suits say a big selling point of annuities _ tax deferral on
investment gains _ is redundant in a 403(b) because, like a 401(k),
it is funded with pretax earnings that grow tax-free until
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell them as 401(k)-type investments without explaining
that they are getting a redundant benefit,'' said Melvyn I. Weiss,
a senior partner in the firm. ``These annuities have become very
popular, and the practice of marketing them for retirement plans is
highly abusive.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies all declined to comment or said the lawsuits were
without merit. &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   3 Banks Slow Flow Of Data to Marketers 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
California's three largest banks said yesterday they would stop
giving confidential information about customers to outside
telemarketing firms in some cases, a practice industry critics have
called abusive and possibly illegal.
<P>
   In the most sweeping ban, Bank of America, the state's largest
bank, said it will stop providing any customer information to
third-party marketers. The bank, which is now headquartered in
North Carolina, said it was responding to customer concerns about
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, the largest bank still based in California,
announced a more limited cutback. The San Francisco bank said it
will only sell financial products such as insurance through outside
telemarketers and discontinue third-party sales of nonfinancial
products.
</P>
<P>
   And in a rapid about-face, San Francisco's Union Bank of
California said it is suspending a telemarketing program set up
just two weeks ago through an outside vendor, pending a review.
</P>
<P>
   The moves come as customer privacy and telemarketing abuse have
exploded as public-policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a San Francisco speech earlier this week, Comptroller of the
Currency John Hawke, a top federal bank regulator, characterized
some agreements between banks and telemarketers as ``seamy.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he slammed arrangements in which banks give
account information to high-pressure telemarketers in exchange for
a cut of sales. He said customers frequently wind up being charged
for products without giving out account information or agreeing to
buy anything.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the Minnesota attorney general sued
Minneapolis' U.S. Bancorp, one of the nation's largest banks, for
providing customer data to a vendor selling health program
memberships. The vendor levied ``bogus, unauthorized charges,'' the
state charged.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp denied any wrongdoing but said it would end its
relationship with outside telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Under typical telemarketing arrangements, banks provide a range
of personal, financial and account data to outside vendors. The
banks get a commission on sales but may have little control over
the vendor's sales tactics.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Bank of America described its ban on providing
customer information to outside marketers as ``industry leading.''
The ban will allow the bank to continue its own telemarketing
activities and sell third-party products by having its own
employees make the pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The bank doesn't know how long it will take to put the ban in
place, spokesman John Cleghorn said. The bank has contracts with
vendors selling products such as travel packages that will take
some time to unwind, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleghorn declined to say how much revenue the bank got from such
sales, but described the cost of the ban as ``not insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank has been talking with the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC)  &LR; for about a month about ending its third-party
telemarketing programs, Cleghorn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We commend the bank for announcing these changes,`` said Julie
Williams, the comptroller's OCC's  &LR; top legal officer, in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mierzwinski, a financial services specialist with U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, called BofA's move a good step but said he
was concerned about loopholes. ``I can't get a straight answer
about whether there are going to be a bunch of exceptions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In a press release, Wells Fargo described its arrangements
with outside telemarketers as ``limited'' and said it doesn't
provide them confidential customer information ``for their
independent use.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Bank of California, the state's third-largest bank, said
it is halting telemarketing by its vendor, Member Works, while it
reviews the relationship. Member Works is the Connecticut firm
named in Minnesota's suit against U.S. Bancorp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is being made in light of the allegations in
Minnesota, and in view of the discomfort of our customers regarding
their expectations of confidentiality and privacy,'' the bank
explained in a memo circulated to employees.

THERE'S MORE TO EDDIE IZZARD THAN WOMEN'S CLOTHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ About midway through ``Eddie Izzard: Dress to
Kill,'' you start looking at the British comedian's face and think,
``That really is very nice makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   You see, Izzard is a transvestite, an ``executive transvestite''
as he is fond of saying, who also points out that he likes girls.
He describes his particular lifestyle choice of cross-dressing as
``male lesbianism.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though he does his ``running, jumping, standing still''
bit at the beginning to prove he can navigate on platform shoes,
that or his painted nails or his colorful Chinese jacket or frosted
hair have little to do with his humor. Or the fact that he is one
of the funniest stand-up comedians working today. Former Monty
Python member John Cleese has called him ``the funniest man in
England,'' but with this HBO special, he has staked a claim to both
sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed last September at San Francisco's Stage Door Theatre,
``Dress to Kill'' shows off the facile mind of Izzard, who slips
from the ironic to the silly to the hilarious with the greatest of
ease.
</P>
<P>
   That would make him interesting enough, but consider the topics:
druids, the Inquisition, the American Revolution, the Killing
Fields, violence in schools, original sin, the Church of England
and squirrels. OK, the Church of England and squirrels are
inherently funny, but Izzard manages to make this odd mix flow.
More than flow _ interconnect in unexpected ways by slyly
referencing an earlier joke or a topic.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard takes pleasure in poking fun at Americans' lack of
knowledge about history, particularly their own. After doing an
amusing impression of how the French in films about the American
Revolution are portrayed as friends of Lafayette, he turns to the
audience and smirks, ``You don't know who he is, do you? What is
it? The Spanish-American War? The French Banana War? What?'' Or he
gives hilarious instructions on how to sing the national anthem
when you don't know the words.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he's being topical, as when he talks about gun control
(remember, this was taped before Littleton) or perjury, Izzard
takes an unusual tack. If we can have different degrees of murder,
why not perjury, he reasons. ``Perjury one is when you say there's
no Holocaust. Perjury nine is when you said you shagged someone
when you didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And Izzard has that cheeky, British wickedness in humor that
keeps you off guard, such as at the end of his bits on Engelbert
Humperdinck or when talking about the first women he nearly slept
with (we won't spoil the jokes).
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what Izzard takes on, he's consistently smart,
funny, surprising and fabulous. Did we mention his bit on the Roman
Empire? &QL;

`CONNECTIONS' HOST GOES ON SEARCH FOR KNOWLEDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you created a book that mirrored the way many
of us seek information on the World Wide Web, it might end up
reading a lot like James Burke's latest tome, ``The Knowledge Web''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 262 pages; $25).
</P>
<P>
   Burke wrote and hosted the PBS TV series ``The Day the Universe
Changed'' and ``Connections'' (``Connections 3'' is now on The
Learning Channel) and created a fun computer game of the same name
a few years back. Now he's taking another traipse through the pages
of scientific and cultural history with ``The Knowledge Web.''
</P>
<P>
   As with previous books such as ``The Pinball Effect'' and, of
course, ``Connections,'' Burke bounces freely across the centuries,
tying together technological developments and their cultural,
economic and political impacts with other seemingly unrelated
topics in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The book's subtitle _ ``From Electronic Agents to Stonehenge and
Back _ and Other Journeys Through Knowledge'' _ gives some idea of
its dizzying breadth.
</P>
<P>
   The result can be remarkably non-linear, hop-scotching across
two dozen developments in a few pages, highlighting interesting
figures from history briefly before heading on to another one. From
Kellogg's Corn Flakes to Coleridge, corn cobs to carborundum, he
traces ties across time that prove intriguing and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Burke further encourages this Web-like approach with a primitive
sort of hypertext that he calls ``gateways.'' Every so often, a
pair of numbers will appear next to a term, showing where a
connection can be found elsewhere in the book for readers
interested in pursuing a different tangent than whatever direction
Burke chose in organizing his writing.
</P>
<P>
   You can jump through the gateways, or stick with Burke's
meandering story line, depending on your bent. And if you've got a
slow Internet connection, you'll definitely be able to hop across
Burke's gateways faster than you could surf the Web. Plus, with a
book, you can read it on a really high-resolution, easily portable
``flat screen. ''
</P>
<P>
   GUIDING LIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Good news for gaming fans online. The same folks who brought us
the truly wonderful All-Music Guide (at www.allmusic.com) have
created the All-Game Guide (at www.allgame.com) with obvious
ambitions to be just as all-encompassing.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Music Guide has long been one of the best resources
(both online and in a series of terrific books) for learning more
about musicians of all kinds and the music they've created.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Game Guide is similar in its ambitious reach, with
information broken down by a dozen kinds of game genres and nearly
50 platforms, stretching all the way back to the very earliest, now
long-dead consoles (Pong, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   You can search by company (Electronic Arts, unsurprisingly,
generates a massive list), by character and much more.
</P>
<P>
   There's great trivia here: Nintendo's Mario surfaced in 1981 as
Jumpman, in another game. But he got a new name and his own
starring role when then-president of Nintendo of America Minoru
Arakawa said the character looked a lot like his Italian landlord,
Mario Segali.
</P>
<P>
   The site also has reviews, codes and cheats, difficulty ratings
and more for specific games. Its creators still have some
substantial work to do because many games lack much or any
information, and areas like a guide to notable video-gaming leaders
haven't yet been implemented.
</P>
<P>
   But the folks behind the All-Music Guide (the general home page
has been cannily renamed the All-Media Guide to include sister
sites for movies and classical music) built their prodigious
database of information by relying on the qualitative input of
thousands of fans.
</P>
<P>
   As with the All-Music Guide, a player will be able to provide
reviews and other information that will help shape how the game is
rated, and give other players a sense of its gameplay.
</P>
<P>
   The more that happens, the more worthwhile the site. In time,
this could be a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   CHARGE IT
</P>
<P>
   If your child's Game Boy is devouring batteries at an alarming
rate, which it no doubt is if Pokemon or some other all-consuming
title is in the house, here's a nifty answer to the battery dollar
drain: an attachable, rechargeable power pack that wraps around the
game machine for up to 22 hours of non-stop use.
</P>
<P>
   The Game Buddy from Battery Technologies Inc. also doubles as a
night light when you plug it in to recharge, giving off a soft
glow. (Of course, the night light may just be a beacon of trouble
for an ought-to-be-sleeping child).
</P>
<P>
   The Game Buddy uses built-in rechargable alkaline manganese
batteries, which the company says will last for at least 2,000
hours, saving you a ton of money over the daily Duracell dose.
</P>
<P>
   I love this product's design, which about doubles the thickness
of a Game Boy Pocket but still allows access to all the important
ports.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has just released a version of the Game Buddy
for the fatter Game Boy Color, though I've not seen it yet. For
more information, check out BTI's Web site at www.game-buddy.com.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft began its promotional blitz for the latest update of
its Office software package this week. Trust me, you'll hear plenty
about it elsewhere from the vaunted MS publicity machine.
</P>
<P>
   For those who've been avoiding this kind of thing, however,
Office 2000 includes Word, Excel and Powerpoint, along with one or
more publishing and Internet programs, depending on which edition
you get.
</P>
<P>
   The entire thing is tightly integrated with soon-to-come
versions of Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer 5.0, and
operating system, Windows 2000, which makes it easier to use, but
no doubt will make Microsoft's anti-trust trial more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a small-time business or home user, do you really
need to spend close to $200 to upgrade to the relevant editions of
this software? Probably not, and certainly not right away, a
refrain we've sung before regarding Microsoft upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Office 2000's biggest benefits will pertain to people
working in large corporations trying to share information with each
other, particularly over Web sites both inside the company and
across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That said, like remoras clinging to a really big shark, other
software companies already are releasing add-on software designed
to expand what Office 2000 does. One such company is Streetwise
Software, which has two packages that work with both Office 97 and
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Office Letters 2000 provides a series of electronic guides to
writing better, along with a raft of stock letters for your
business and personal needs. It's just the sort of thing small
companies and work-at-home types can most use, given their
typically slender resources. The package also comes with 500 fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Office Graphics 2000 packages some of Streetwise's fine
Professor Franklin graphics and photo editing tools with tons of
clip art, fonts and design templates for all three of Office's main
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The package also includes Art Alive 3D!, an art program with
more than 500 3-D models that you can manipulate, dress up and drop
into your documents. All told, this is a sort of odds-and-ends
package of nifty little stuff that fills out some areas Microsoft
somehow overlooked. &QL;

CLINTON TO REPUBLICANS: `LIGHTEN UP' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb.) (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Friday night that
Republicans opposed his policies because they were frustrated that
a Democrat had won the White House and taken up all of its perks,
like parking spaces, and he suggested that they ``lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the PBS program ``The News Hour,'' the
president was asked why most House Republicans had not supported
the bombing campaign in Kosovo. The interviewer, Jim Lehrer,
suggested that Clinton may have squandered his trust with voters,
and he quoted Sen. Chuck Hagel, the R-Neb, as saying, ``This
president has debased the one currency we each have in this
business, and that's trust, and he'll never get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called that remark self-serving and insisted he was
trustworthy. He said a historian had noted that he had kept a
higher percentage of his commitments to voters than had any of the
five presidents who preceded him.
</P>
<P>
   The president went on to say that Republicans had spent more
than seven years ``attacking me personally because they knew the
American people agreed with my ideas and the direction in which I
was taking the country, and on one occasion, much to my eternal
regret, I gave them a little ammunition,'' a reference to the
extramarital affair that led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have been trustworthy in my public obligations to the
American people,'' Clinton said. He also said he had been
trustworthy in his dealings with the Republicans, even though he
did not always agree with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten quite a lot done when they have put aside their
personal frustration at not owning the White House,'' Clinton said.
``The truth is, you know, those folks ought to lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans believed they were entitled to the White
House. ``They never thought there'd be another Democratic president
in their lifetime, and they're all gearing up again because they
think they're entitled to the parking spaces outside here and to
the office space and all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to just relax and realize I'm a temporary tenant,''
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   The president dismissed the notion that he could not be trusted,
saying that such a personal attack was all the Republicans could
muster because the country was in such good shape. ``You just get
madder and madder when the country does well, then all you have
left is a personal attack and say, `Oh, I just don't trust the
guy.' But that's not good for America.''

MORE BOOK PUBLISHERS TALK OF MERGER
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The News Corp.'s HarperCollins is in discussions to acquire the
Hearst Corp.'s Avon Books and William Morrow &AMP; Co., a person close
to the talks confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would bring together the publisher of ``Men Are From
Mars, Women Are From Venus,'' ``Up Island'' and ``The Dilbert
Principle'' _ all from HarperCollins _ with Morrow, the publisher
of ``We are Our Mothers' Daughters,'' by Cokie Roberts, and Avon
titles like ``Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Mergers have swept the publishing business in the last several
years, fueled by cost-cutting and the desire for more leverage in
dealing with both writers and bookstores. But even if the News
Corp. acquires Avon and Morrow, it would still trail Bertelsmann's
Random House, with 1998 estimated sales of $1.9 billion.
HarperCollins had 1998 sales of $760 million, while Avon and Morrow
had sales of about $180 million combined, according to Subtext, an
industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were reported in The Hollywood Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, which had been going through hard times as
recently as 1997, has experienced a turnaround under its new
president and chief executive, Jane Friedman, who was lured from
Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   The News Corp. took a $270 million charge for HarperCollins in
1997, and there were rumors that it might try to sell the
publishing company. Instead, HarperCollins chose to revamp by
slashing staff and canceling many books for which authors had
missed their contractual deadlines. The decision to cancel the
books created a furor in the industry because it was such an
unusual move.
</P>
<P>
   The company also changed its publishing strategy by reducing the
number of books it would publish so that it could focus its
marketing. The strategy worked, and last year HarperCollins had 34
titles on The New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Avon and Morrow have also been having some tough times. Some
industry experts believe that the problems started in 1993 when
Hearst put the publishers up for sale and nearly struck a deal with
MCA's Putnam Berkeley Group. But Hearst eventually took them off
the market. Shortly after negotiations with Putnam Berkeley
collapsed, Howard Kaminsky, then president of Hearst's trade book
division, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the two units have published such well-known authors
as Sidney Sheldon and Faye Kellerman. But there have also been
debacles, including the decision to pay Whoopi Goldberg a rumored
$6 million advance for ``Book,'' which did poorly, as did Paul
Reiser's ``Babyhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A Hearst executive did not return phone calls and a spokesman
for Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of the News Corp.,
declined to comment on the talks. &QL;

FROM DOCTORS TO DIPLOMATS, THEY CHASE PIANO DREAMS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Juanita Madland, a schoolteacher from Los
Alamos, N.M., walked purposefully across the brightly lighted stage
of the Ed Landreth Auditorium at Texas Christian University,
smiling a little sheepishly at the audience, and approached the
great black hulk of the Steinway concert piano dominating the
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous,'' she said later, still flushed from
the performance. ``But once I got out there, I was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-proclaimed amateur pianists from around the world are here
for the first International Piano Competition for Outstanding
Amateurs. It is presented by the Van Cliburn Foundation, longtime
sponsor of the famous Van Cliburn International Piano Competition,
a quadrennial event first held in 1962 that includes professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 150 people sent in applications from 23 states and nine
foreign countries and just under 100 were chosen to compete. Among
them are two ambassadors, three homemakers, four journalists, two
ophthalmologists, two eye, ear, nose and throat specialists, a
dermatologist, two flight attendants, a director of table games for
a Nevada casino, an automobile glass installer and assorted
authors, professors, business executives, consultants, jurists and
computer specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just heard a blackjack dealer play Chopin's G minor Ballade
and you know what, he did a really nice job,'' said Michael Hawley,
37, a media technology professor at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who is planning to play Liszt's ``Mephisto'' in the
semifinals, if he makes it there.
</P>
<P>
   Like many here, Ms. Madland, 57, had once seriously considered a
performing career. ``But that was B.C.,'' she said. ``Before
children. I really hadn't performed in 36 years until I picked it
up again a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   She gingerly worked her way through Brahms' Intermezzo in A
major, smiling sheepishly again as she rose to acknowledge the
applause at the end of her 10-minute performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectually, I knew I could do it, but emotionally, that is
something else,'' she said. ``I lost a lot of confidence in 37
years. Now I think perhaps I got some of it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Modeled on the Councours des Grands Amateurs de Piano, a
competition for amateur classical pianists held in Paris every year
since 1989, the competition is the first of its kind to be held in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people want to have a change of life back to
music, while another group has music as a central part of their
lives, but not central to their earning a living,'' said one
competitor, Marcus Raskin, 64, a member of the National Security
Council during the Kennedy administration and author and editor of
17 books on public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodzinski, executive director of the Cliburn Foundation,
said the love of music at the Paris event, which he attended at the
suggestion of Nela Rubinstein, wife of pianist Arthur Rubinstein,
persuaded him to move ahead in Fort Worth. The foundation's goal,
he said, is to attract ``not just amateurs or dabblers, but really
outstanding amateurs.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition's first prize, the jury prize, includes a cash
award of $2,000, a promise to be allowed to perform with an
orchestra in Paris, an invitation to visit the next Van Cliburn
competition and an assortment of piano CDs: all told one-thousandth
of the total package that goes to the winner of the professional
Van Cliburn competitions.
</P>
<P>
   But these contestants were not here for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Ms. Madland or Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of
The New York Times, had once seriously considered a music career
and were now revisiting that desire, perhaps to retaste its
pleasures and perhaps to help silence that niggling inner voice
asking about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had considered making music my career,'' said Hawley of
M.I.T. ``But I also always thought that I didn't want to be in a
position of waking up jet-lagged and thinking: `Where am I? Oh,
yes. It's Tuesday; it must be Beethoven.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many contestants said they had played very little except for
their own amusement in recent years. But many others had somehow
managed to keep up their training, often with the help of a coach
who continued to guide them. (Hawley called his ``my private
Yoda.'') Both flight attendants in the competition said they chose
their career, in part, because it gave them significant chunks of
time in which to practice and perform.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid confusion with the long-standing Van Cliburn
competition, contestants were limited to those over the age of 30
who were amateurs and making their living in some other field.
</P>
<P>
   In the preliminary round, each contestant performed for 10
minutes, beginning on Wednesday and ending Friday night, with the
announcement of the dozen or so asked to perform a 20-minute
repertory in the semifinals on Saturday. Then, six are to be chosen
to take part in the finals on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed with the response we got,'' Rodzinski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Raskin said he had not performed before an audience, or even
practiced seriously, in ``more than a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, performing here was, in part, a way of putting certain
things to rest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was struck by the way people from so many varied
backgrounds so easily found a common language in their passion for
the piano.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Benedini, Brazil's ambassador and consul general in Miami,
said he had the same sense of communion with the other performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all seemed to me very interesting people and from such a
tremendous broadness of activities,'' he said. ``But everyone is
very relaxed, enjoying themselves, taking the whole thing as a new
experience.'' If the competition succeeds, Rodzinski said, there
may well be a move to hold future amateur competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether it will be every four years, maybe every
two years,'' he said. ``It depends on how it turns out, how much
effort is involved and, financially, how things are going to work
out.''

TEEN THRIVES IN FISHBOWL OF MTV'S `REAL WORLD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: The season premiere is Tuesday, June 15 at 10 p.m. on MTV).  
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seven attractive, co-ed roommates get chosen to
live in a ridiculously plush house in Hawaii _ landscaped with its
own pool and mini ``volcano'' _ for three months. Their only job?
To be TV stars and run a ``cafe and performance space.'' Par-tay!
</P>
<P>
   That's what Colin, a 19-year-old Thousand Oaks, Calif., native
figured when he tried out for MTV's ``The Real World,'' the
(ITALICS BEGIN) &UR; video verite &LR; (ITALICS END) program that throws
seven college-age people together in a different location each
season. The show returns 10 p.m. Tuesday with a one-hour special
(regular half-hour episodes run weekly at the same time).
</P>
<P>
   Colin (the cast isn't permitted to give out their last names
during the show's run) failed to make the cut the first time
around, along with 23,000 other hopefuls. According to MTV, that's
27 percent more young adults than applied to Harvard last year.
</P>
<P>
   As a consolation prize, he was tapped to host a TV special about
the casting of the show. Bummer ... but at least, he figured, he'd
get some on-camera experience from that gig. After all, he's an
aspiring sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   But during the taping, the outgoing student's personality won
over the program's producers, who decided to reverse their decision
and give Colin a berth on ``The Real World.'' Colin was elated: On
the show's first episode, we see him collapse in a joyous frenzy
with a friend just after getting the news.
</P>
<P>
   Colin, though, ended up getting a lot more than he bargained
for. One of his roommates turned out to have an alcohol problem so
serious it landed her in the emergency room; another left the show
early, for a variety of reasons including just being tired of
living under a microscope.
</P>
<P>
   Colin, who turned out to be the youngest of this year's group,
admits he wasn't prepared for the experience of being constantly
on-camera with a bunch of strangers thrown together from all
different backgrounds. His roommates included Amaya, a 21-year-old
UCLA graduate; Justin, also 21, a child prodigy already in his
second year at Harvard Law School; Chicago native Kaia, 22, a fan
of fitness and African culture; Matt, a 22-year-old Del Mar native
looking for love; Ruthie, 21, whose alcoholism apparently stems
from a painful childhood in a foster home in Hawaii; and Teck, 22,
a minister's son-cum-ladies' man who aspires to a career in
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really went into this process naively, as most people
probably do. I figured it would be nice to have a break from school
and to just be on the show,'' admitted Colin, now a student at UC
Berkeley, in a phone interview from Hawaii. ``You really learn
quickly that it's a total loss of privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is the appeal for MTV viewers, who have made
``The Real World'' the cable channel's top-rated show. It's also
been the top-rated show on basic cable for its time slot among
young adults for the past several years. Part soap opera, part
therapy session, ``The Real World'' has become a real-life
``Melrose Place'' for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a cast member finds he can't take living in a
glass house. This year, Justin, the 21-year-old law student, who is
active in gay causes, ended up jumping ship. Jonathan Murray, one
of the show's executive producers, says Justin ended up being
``uncomfortable'' with the show's process and regretted having
joined the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Murray says that from early on, they've sought out cast members
who didn't have acting aspirations _ part of a drive to keep the
show more diverse and unstaged. Still, the series has spawned a few
show-biz careers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Nies went on from the show's first season to appear on
MTV's exercise show, ``The Grind,'' and host a series of popular
``Grind'' videos. Jacinda Barrett, a cast member of season four in
London, has gotten major television acting jobs, including on NBC's
``Wind and Water.'' Jason Cornwell, who appeared on the Boston
``Real World'' two years ago, has become an associate casting
director for the show. Also, a number of young people who have been
``rejects'' for the show have ended up working for ``The Real
World's'' production company, Van Nuys-based Bunim/Murray
Productions (see related story).
</P>
<P>
   Colin admits the show could help him in his ambition to go into
sports broadcasting. ``I knew it couldn't hurt, though that wasn't
the main reason I wanted to be on the show,'' he said. ``Of
course,'' he added, ``I also thought about the possible backlash.
... If you come off looking like a complete freak, it could end up
hurting you.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Colin couldn't have bargained for was becoming
romantically involved with one of his housemates. He and Amaya, a
blond Oakland native, launched what MTV terms in a press release
``the first-ever serious romance between two of the roommates.''
Despite the fact that the show's producers make a policy of bowing
out if two of their young charges start ``getting busy,'' the
couple found the scrutiny a strain on their budding relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Colin graciously allows that ``I would really like to keep in
touch with her ... I can say we'll stay in contact.'' But the
couple admits the pressure of not really conducting their
relationship in the ``real world'' probably took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, Colin says he's glad he did the show. ``It
turned out to be some of the best of times and the worst of times
I've been through,'' he says philosophically. ``I don't think
there's anything in the world I can liken this experience to. It's
very unique.'' &QL;

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PAMPHLET RISES IRE OF CONSERVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.) (rk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Education recently drafted a
pamphlet advising school districts and colleges how to avoid being
sued for discrimination if a standardized test they use produces a
wide racial disparity in scores.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that advice, the department now finds itself
under attack by conservatives who charge it is trying to do away
with tests all together.
</P>
<P>
   Writing op-ed articles and columns and planting news stories in
educational journals, a group of anti-affirmative action
conservatives in recent weeks has alleged that the Department of
Education's advice represents an attack on the concept of merit as
measured by tests like as the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Such an attack, these critics charge, is a way to help
minorities, especially blacks and Hispanics, who tend not to score
as well on these exams as do whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Department of Education has created a novel policy to
close the racial performance gap on the Scholastic Assessment Test
and the American College Testing exams: make it illegal for
colleges to use the results if minority students perform below
white students,'' wrote Edward Blum and Marc Levin, two opponents
of affirmative action in a recent column published in The Wall
Street Journal. The article was headlined, ``Washington's War on
Standardized Tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Such criticism has exasperated Education officials who say they
are merely describing the current state of the law as a way to help
school administrators who are under intense political pressure to
have pupils pass standardized tests to be promoted. The draft
booklet, which was circulated last month to educators and testing
companies, barely mentions the SAT and ACT examinations, the
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to capture existing, long-standing
anti-discrimination principles and to discuss test measurement
standards in a way to help educators and policy-makers devise and
craft appropriate test-use policy,'' said Arthur Coleman, deputy
assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a highly complex area of civil rights law known as
disparate impact theory. The theory is based on a number of Supreme
Court decisions stating that if minorities or women score
significantly lower on a given test, then using that test for
decisions like admitting students to college, promoting pupils to
the next grade or assigning them to gifted programs or special
education may be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Once a racial or gender disparity in a test results is shown,
courts have held that schools or colleges must then show whether
there is an ``educational necessity'' for the test and whether
there are alternative means of evaluating students.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Heubert, an expert on testing and disparate impact law at
Columbia University Teachers College, said that while the burden
sounds onerous, courts have said that schools and colleges can meet
it if they show that the test is being used for the purpose for
which its producers say it should be used.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Educational Testing Service, which produces the
SAT, says it should not be used as the sole criterion for college
admissions. Rather, the ETS recommends using tests in combination
with an applicant's grade point average and teacher
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very well established principle in the law and in
the standards adopted by testing professionals,'' said Heubert, an
associate professor of education at Teachers College and an adjunct
professor of law at Columbia law school. ``That is to say that no
important decision about an individual should be made on the basis
solely on the basis of a single test score.''
</P>
<P>
   When the draft of the pamphlet first was presented to
representatives of school public school administrators, colleges
and test makers at a meeting with Education officials on May 14,
officials at the Educational Testing Service ``panicked,'' said
Anthony Carnavale, a vice president at ETS. According to Carnavale,
test makers feared that the Clinton administration was trying to
get colleges to use an alternative to the SAT or ACT examinations.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting a second time with officials with the Department
of Education, Carnavale said many of his organization's fears were
allayed. But he said he was concerned that the publicity
surrounding the pamphlet may have given fodder to conservatives who
are against affirmative action in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., who opposes affirmative
action programs that provide breaks to minorities and women, has
scheduled hearings on the department's draft pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of screwed up,'' Carnavale said. ``It's a juicy story.
It's race. It's affirmative action and the power of the federal
government. It all kind of plays into the politics of the moment.
The irony is, all of us in the testing community who are being
portrayed as antagonists, really want this document. And we have
set forces in motion who want to kill it.''

DISNEY ANIMATORS IMAGINE JUNGLE HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; One of the best-known pop-culture creations of
the 20th century has finally joined forces with the era's top
pop-culture factory.
</P>
<P>
   Tarzan _ the jungle hero of 24 Edgar Rice Burroughs books, 47
live-action movies, TV shows, comics and other artifacts too
numerous to mention _ is now the subject of the Walt Disney Co.'s
37th fully animated feature film.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a long-overdue natural, that's because it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``About three months ago, we got a letter that Burroughs wrote
in 1936 to his son Jack, about a possible animated version of
Tarzan,'' notes producer Bonnie Arnold. ``It said three things: It
has to look naturalistic, it must have a great deal of humor, and
it must approximate Disney excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was an interesting validation of what we'd been
doing,'' she adds. ``But if we'd have seen that letter about three
years ago, when we were first starting, we'd have been totally
intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not like they weren't anyway. Tarzan is known to millions as the
ultimate Ape Man, not big on conversation but one of the all-time
great hollerers. The popular Johnny Weissmuller film series of the
1930s and '40s pretty much fixed the not-so-smart, ``Me Tarzan, you
Jane'' image in the public imagination forevermore.
</P>
<P>
   But those who actually read Burroughs (the initial ``Tarzan of
the Apes'' story was first published in 1912) knew that the King of
the Jungle _ actually a shipwrecked English aristocrat raised from
babyhood by African gorillas _ was a superhuman combination of
animal physical ability and outstanding intelligence. Could both
the Burroughs fans' and the general public's very different
expectations be satisfied in a cartoon that, at the same time,
would appeal to kids with no knowledge of the pulp hero's previous
incarnations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, I didn't want to do it at all,'' says co-director
Kevin Lima (``A Goofy Movie''). ``I was actually pretty skeptical
about the material when it was first offered to me. Why make
another movie that has been made, seemingly to me, hundreds of
times? I didn't think there was room for a new Tarzan film that
could speak to contemporary audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I went back and read the book, and I was actually
kind of shocked that the tale that was in the book had really never
been put down on film. I think part of that was because a human
actor could never do half of the things that Burroughs describes.
The next thing I thought was that the movies never really explored
the relationship between Tarzan and the animal world, specifically
the apes, in a satisfying way. That seemed like another reason to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   How to do it was a whole other matter. Anthropomorphic apes and
other creatures would hardly pose a challenge to Disney, whom many
feel reached its animation zenith with its last Africa-set feature,
``The Lion King,'' in 1994. But that was set on semi-arid plains
and hills. What the filmmakers needed was a method of putting their
animals and animal-man in a convincing, primeval rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted a naturalistic look, so the audience could relate to
Tarzan's journey a little better,'' explains co-director Chris
Buck. ``We took a research trip to Africa, and being there, in this
three-dimensional world, surrounded by the beautiful, lush jungle,
we were struggling with how we could bring this back to the
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the great advances Disney has pioneered over the last
decade, traditional cel animation was still a stubbornly
two-dimensional art form. The solution lay in a new computer
graphics program that Disney dubbed Deep Canvas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invented a lot of tricks, and we've had a lot of really
interesting, technological breakthroughs at the studio, but we
still weren't getting some of the shots that we really wanted to
get,'' says veteran Disney layout supervisor Daniel St. Pierre, who
served as art director for ``Tarzan.'' ``Especially given that
Tarzan is so mobile and could move through the treetops
effortlessly, it was important to me to be able to take the camera
up there, too, and give the audience a similar kind of experience
to what Tarzan would have.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve his aim, St. Pierre approached CG supervisor Eric
Daniels, whose team then set about the mammoth applied-mathematics
task of developing a program that could change complex forest
dimensions, details and directions as fast as the new, hyper-agile
Tarzan could swing through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process we came up with basically does what a painter
does,'' explains Daniels, who divides his own time between computer
work and traditional pencil drawing. ``A painter creates a painting
by building it up out of hundreds of thousands of brush strokes,
dabbing a little bit of paint there, a bit of green here, then
changing it to slightly bluer or darker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rendering software repaints those brush strokes over and
over, hundreds of times _ but each time it paints them slightly
differently. It paints this stroke a little over to the left
because that tree is moving past us, or that stroke up a little bit
because that leaf is moving up at that particular moment. So when
you see the `Tarzan' backgrounds moving in three dimensions, you're
actually seeing hundreds of individual paintings that were created
using this software.''
</P>
<P>
   That was only the environment. For the main attraction, Tarzan
himself, the filmmakers sought out Disney's most accomplished
character animator of the modern era, Glen Keane. After bringing
the likes of the Little Mermaid, ``Beauty's'' Beast, Aladdin and
Pocahontas to screen life, Keane had taken a well-deserved
sabbatical in Paris, where he spent a year studying the great
masters and anatomy drawing.
</P>
<P>
   He had essentially decided to stay with his family in the French
capital when team ``Tarzan'' came calling. But the chance to work
on a childhood favorite was too hard to resist. (Keane ended up
enjoying the best of both worlds; while most of the movie was
animated in Burbank, he supervised Tarzan's animation at Disney's
Paris studio). &UR;  &QL; 
( &LR; SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The artist's father, ``Family Circus'' cartoonist Bill Keane,
had taught his son how to draw using the influential ``Dynamic
Anatomy'' book by Burne Hogarth, one of the outstanding artists who
drew the ``Tarzan'' newspaper comic strip. The youthful Keane was
also such a big fan of fantasy painter Frank Frazetta that he never
got around to reading his paperback copy of ``Tarzan of the Apes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I'd try to read the book, I couldn't resist the
temptation to try to draw that great Frazetta cover,'' Keane
recalls. So he, too, was startled when he finally got around to
reading Burroughs in preparation for the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that this guy was going to be a lot of fun to do,''
Keane notes, ``because the only way to bring him to life was by
going through the process myself, mentally, that Tarzan had to to
learn to move and to survive, and to base all of your movements on
animal study.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that and skateboarding. Keane not only raided his own
childhood memories for Tarzan's look; his own son, Max, inspired
the animated ape man's need-for-speed manner of locomotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been looking at Johnny Weissmuller swinging on the vine
and realized that that was not the way I wanted Tarzan to move,''
Keane reveals. ``It was a passive way of moving through the jungle;
the vine does all the work, and he hangs on. It's also just lateral
movement across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something where Tarzan could be more active,
aggressive, attacking the jungle. At the same time, my son was
skateboarding all the time across from the Eiffel Tower at a place
called the Trocadero. All the kids did it there, and they never did
it on anything flat. It was always angles, something dangerous that
could break your arm. He was coming home with these bloody knees,
and I said, `Max, why are you doing this?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, it's fun,' and it just clicked for me. In all
these extreme sports videos that he'd been bringing home, there was
this thrill in the adrenaline rush that was the fun that they were
looking for. And for Tarzan to move through the trees, it couldn't
be just the getting from Point A to Point B; it had to be the
getting there was the fun for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Tarzan swings in every which direction using every limb
God gave him, and surfs along gnarly, moss-covered branches like he
was shooting the curl at Zuma.
</P>
<P>
   But although the visual aspects of ``Tarzan'' are its most
memorable elements, much more was required to make it into a mass
Disney entertainment. Voice casting was, of course, crucial. Tony
Goldwyn (``Ghost'') provided the adult Tarzan's alternately
articulate and grunting voice. He also did a pretty good job of
approximating the signature Weissmuller Tarzan yell _ with a little
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whole big deal trying to get the yell just right, we
kept going back and forth,'' Goldwyn admits. ``It's mainly my
voice, but they helped it electronically by extending it. I think
they may even have other voices in there, like opera singers
helping with the yodel.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver essays Tarzan's spunky English love interest Jane,
Glenn Close and Lance Henriksen voice his gorilla ``parents,'' and
Rosie O'Donnell is his comic ape pal, Terk. The film's musical
numbers, which are mostly played over montages rather than ``sung''
by the characters, were produced and performed by crooning drummer
Phil Collins, who was chosen specifically for his percussive sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balancing the tone of the film was probably the most difficult
thing that we did,'' admits director Lima. ``Because you have,
basically, three elements: the drama, the comedy and the
action-adventure. All three of them have to be perfectly balanced
in order for it to feel like one texture. You don't want the
sidekicks to suddenly take over the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Burroughs fans are wary of potential
over-Disneyfication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, animation can portray Tarzan interacting with
animals more intimately and can create ideal backdrops, especially
when you're talking about a fantasy Africa,'' respected Burroughs
authority James Van Hise acknowledges. ``But a fully animated
feature is inevitably going to have more comedy elements in it,
which seems to be considered a necessity to balance out any of the
serious stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One expert, while noting that some compromises have been made,
is nevertheless thrilled by how true Disney's ``Tarzan'' is to the
spirit of the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The live movies magnificently lacked my grandfather's
characters and his action and a lot of the elements that he made
famous in the books, and it just frustrated the daylights out of
him,'' says Danton Burroughs. ``This movie brings Tarzan back up to
the heroic, articulate stature that he always should have had. This
is the most fantastic portrayal of Tarzan that, I think, the public
will ever have seen.''

COMPANIES SCRAMBLE TO KILL COMPUTER `WORM'
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash., Pa., Texas, Calif., Germany, France, Britain)  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Large corporations worldwide scrambled Friday to halt the spread
of a malicious computer program that began infecting computers in
Israel on Monday and spread rapidly to Europe and the United
States, carried by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a computer attack known as a worm, destroys
documents created by several widely used Microsoft programs,
including Word and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still receiving new reports, although they are tapering
off from what we were receiving yesterday,'' Jeff Havrilla, a
member of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon
University, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co.'s e-mail system remained down most of Friday as
teams worked to clean up after the attack. As of Friday night,
Boeing workers still had not determined how many files were lost, a
spokesman, David Suffia, said.
</P>
<P>
   The Intel Corp. reported minimal damage, most of it confined to
its Israel offices.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Electronic Data Systems Corp. in Dallas, which
has sites in 47 countries, said only six of them had been infected
and that the company began inoculating all its computers an hour
after the first report Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chien, a researcher at the Symantec Anti-Virus Research
Center in Santa Monica, Calif., said he had first heard reports
from Israel of worm attacks late Sunday night, Pacific time, and
that reports from the United States began to arrive late Tuesday.
The company also got reports of infections from Germany, France and
Britain. He said it took just 10 minutes to adjust the company's
Norton anti-virus software to detect and destroy the worm and
another 10 minutes to write up a description and a warning.
</P>
<P>
   But it took much longer for companies around the world to apply
the updated anti-virus software and assess damages.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly harmful aspect of this worm is that a single
infection can affect an entire network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disastrous in that you lose not just your data but
everything on your file server,'' Chien said.
</P>
<P>
   File servers are computers that store files and programs shared
by a network. Often data from an entire corporation is backed up on
file servers. A typical large company has 20,000 to 40,000
computers connected to four or five file servers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program initially infects a computer when a user receives an
e-mail message, ostensibly from an acquaintance, stating: ``I
received your e-mail and I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then,
take a look at the attached zipped docs. Bye.'' When the recipient
attempts to open the attachment, a program is executed that deletes
files. It then sends the same e-mail message as a reply to all
unread mail in the recipient's in box as well as to all subsequent
e-mail messages sent to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   The worm only infects machines running Microsoft Windows or
operating systems that emulate Windows, but it can delete files on
other computers in the network regardless of what operating system
they use. The program can be sent only via Microsoft e-mail
programs and other e-mail programs that use the Windows support
software for e-mail, known as MAPI.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients of the e-mail who use the popular Eudora program, in
its default setting, will lose files but will not spread the worm.

EXECUTIVE GROUP ATTACKS MILITARY EXCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 13)  
(DW) 
 By ERIC QUINONES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why must Bell Industries, a computer services company in El
Segundo, Calif., go all the way to India to hire programmers? The
company's co-chairman, Theodore Williams, thinks it is because
America doesn't have its priorities straight.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says his frustration at being unable to find enough
qualified Americans for the jobs is why he believes the goals of
Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities are so important. The
organization is a group of business people campaigning for
fundamental changes in the way the government uses its resources,
and Williams is one of the founders.
</P>
<P>
   To Williams and others in the group, the shortage of programmers
is symptomatic of an education system that is starved of money and
hurting America's competitiveness, all while billions of dollars
are lavished on unproductive military spending. The group wants a
higher budget priority for schools, health care for children and
other programs to insure America's future economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Led by an unabashed liberal activist, Ben Cohen, co-founder of
Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, the group has attracted members like Paul
Newman and Ted Turner _ names that are decidedly not part of the
business mainstream. But most of the group's members are
lesser-known executives and business owners who hope their
practical business background will give them credibility with
lawmakers and voters.
</P>
<P>
   The group steers away from the usual ideological and partisan
camps. It does not ask its members about their party affiliations,
and several members said in interviews that encouraging wiser
spending was a goal that fit a conservative agenda as well as a
liberal one.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Conservative' means prudence, and `conservative' means not
spending money indiscriminately without a return,'' said Arnold
Hiatt, chairman of the Stride Rite Foundation and another of the
group's founders. ``I think an awful lot of money is being spent,
particularly in the Defense Department, not for the right
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But pacifism isn't on the group's agenda, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in favor of a strong military,'' said Bruce Klatsky,
the chairman and chief executive of the Philips-Van Heusen Corp., a
clothing and shoe manufacturer, and also a founder of the group.
``What we are against is the waste in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's profile rose considerably late last year when it
began an advertising campaign arguing that, with the Cold War over,
billions of dollars could safely be cut from nuclear weapons
programs and from new generations of fighter aircraft and attack
submarines meant to replace models that are already the world's
best.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing these views, the business group relies on several
military advisers, including Lawrence Korb, assistant defense
secretary in the Reagan administration, and Paul C. Warnke, chief
arms negotiator in the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the group's message is anathema to the
military industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon spent $44 billion on weapons last year, the least
in more than a decade, said John W. Douglass, president and chief
executive of the Aerospace Industries Association of America. Over
all, he said, arms spending has fallen by 70 percent since the end
of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to try to say that Americans have two choices, education
or Pentagon waste, is just an outrageous oversimplification and
unfair statement,'' Douglass said.
</P>
<P>
   The business group counters that military spending is already
rebounding. Even before NATO began bombing Yugoslavia in late
March, the Clinton administration was asking Congress for the
biggest increase in military spending since the 1980s, an
additional $112 billion over the next five years, raising the
Pentagon budget to $319 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're in a warlike state creates a climate for
larger budget increases and less examination of the wastefulness
that already exists,'' Newman said in an interview conducted before
the Kosovo peace agreement was concluded late last week.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders' group has grown from 5 members in 1996 _
Messrs. Cohen, Williams, Hiatt and Klatsky, as well as Alan
Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Hasbro _ to 450 today.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the advertising campaign, the group is also paying for a
bus tour called ``U Slice the Pie.'' It began in April in
Washington and is to run through November, spending a lot of time
in Iowa, an early stop in the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At events like county fairs and church picnics, three young
actors present the group's message using huge inflatable displays
with statistics on budget allocations, military industry lobbying
and job creation. The bus is painted to look like piles of cash;
some of the executives have spoken at the stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of federal budget priorities is kind of dry,''
Cohen said. ``It's kind of off-putting to people. The object of the
`U Slice the Pie' performance is to make it fun and exciting.'' &QL;

DISNEY ENACTS HIRING FREEZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co., amid continuing pressure from
Wall Street to boost its lagging stock price, has instituted a
hiring freeze across the corporation, sources have said.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant refused to comment on reports that all
Disney divisions have been instructed by corporate headquarters in
Burbank, Calif., to refrain from filling vacancies and making
additional hires. Disney, which has annual revenues of $25 billion,
had 117,000 employees as of last September.
</P>
<P>
   Sources also indicated Disney executives, while not having been
ordered to start layoffs, have tightened requirements on use of
temporary workers and overtime. The Hollywood Reporter, citing
unnamed sources, said Friday that the freeze may be lifted in a few
cases to fill slots of departing staffers, important executives and
``significant talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner ordered a cost-savings
review in late April after Disney reported a 30 percent drop in
profits for its second quarter ended March 31 but was vague as to
what steps would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to make our businesses more efficient, increase our
cash flow and position ourselves to better capitalize on the
long-term growth potential of our brands,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Disney stock has fallen 11 percent and closed
down 50 cents Friday at $28.875. The issue is down 32 percent from
its all-time high in May 1998 while rivals Time Warner, Seagram and
Viacom have posted healthy gains.
</P>
<P>
   Disney stock has declined as analysts have cut earnings
estimates over a wide variety of concerns: Weakness in
merchandising and home video; ongoing problems at ABC television;
competition from Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in
Orlando, Fla.; and concerns over Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue topped $38 in January on bullishness over Disney's
Infoseek partnership but the recent announcement of plans to buy
the rest of Infoseek generated little enthusiasm. Analysts have
been troubled by this week's departure of Disney's top Internet
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's culture is antithetical to the Internet, which is
sort of a cowboy culture,'' said Forrester Research analyst Joseph
Butt Jr. ``The perception is that pure-play Internet companies are
much more nimble and focused. The Web, frankly, is an area that the
rest of Disney doesn't really understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock price decline is embarrassing for Eisner since he was
America's best paid chief executive last year due to his decision
to cash in more than $500 million in stock options. Eisner's
reputation has also been hurt by his refusal to settle the
high-profile lawsuit filed by former Disney studio chief Jeffrey
Katzenberg over Disney's alleged failure to pay $580 million in
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hyman, an analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, said,
``The hiring freeze was not surprising. There's always going to be
tremendous pressure on any major blue chip company that's not
performing, especially with Eisner receiving such tremendous
payouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyman noted that Disney already carries a reputation for paying
employees less than rivals, so it may be forced to take more
drastic steps, particularly with the ABC network, beset by soaring
programming costs and unimpressive ratings in its three years under
Disney's wing. ABC instituted a hiring freeze last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent rumor that was going around was that they were
going to spin off ABC,'' Hyman said. ``They have to get the stock
moving again, so the logical place to start would be ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Hyman said, the answer might be consolidation or
coordination with the other networks with some sort of relaxation
of Federal Communication Commission rules against such links.

`STAR WARS' FANS WANT TO SINK THE `TITANIC'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETTY KWONG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the hype had subsided,
``Star Wars'' fans are flooding the Internet with impassioned pleas
to pack the theaters once again.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think George Lucas himself was behind the international
movement, but two Internet site creators operating out of Maryland
are claiming credit for the idea.
</P>
<P>
   June 19, they have proclaimed, will be Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   In celebration of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace's'' one-month anniversary, they want devotees to gather
their friends, dress as their favorite characters and go see the
movie over and over again, just like on opening day of the
much-anticipated prequel.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan: Dethrone ``Titanic,'' current king of the box-office
gross chart.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lofty goal, considering the movie had only climbed to
11th-highest grosser of all time as of close of business Thursday,
reaping a total of $271.3 million by its 23rd day in theaters.
``Forrest Gump'' and ``Lion King'' were still ahead of the
``Phantom.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Daoudi, 21, of Tarzana is paying no mind to the movie
pundits who have widely declared ``Phantom'' an attendance dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get people to enjoy the movie and believe
in `Star Wars' again _ and try to make it pass `Titanic,''' said
Daoudi, the self-anointed man in charge of Los Angeles' Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Pierce College student is occupying much of his time trying
to spread the word about Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   He's circulating Fan Day fliers. He's making up Fan Day badges
that participants can wear around their necks that day. He's even
tried recruiting toy stores and movie theaters to sponsor and host
the event.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about a phantom menace. Many of his efforts have fallen
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Toy companies aren't interested in supplying free lightsabers to
fans in line. And a disappointed Daoudi discovered last week that
Mann's Chinese Theater in Hollywood, site of all the craze on
opening day, won't even be showing the film anymore by the time Fan
Day arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Baker, vice president of marketing for Mann Theaters, said
taking ``Phantom'' off the schedules at Mann's Chinese and its
Westwood Village locations after June 17 was decided long before
the movie debuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what happened, that was just the deal that we
made with Fox,'' said Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The film, she said, met Mann's expectations for attendance, with
long lines waiting to get in at both theaters during the first
week. But the crowds diminished after that, and on Friday, ``The
General's Daughter'' will replace ``Phantom'' on the marquee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go, `It's been there long enough. We gotta show other
movies,''' Daoudi said. ``I go, in my head, `Stupid mooove.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he pressed on, redirecting local fans to celebrate at
Burbank's AMC 14 theater at Palm and First streets, which is
scheduled to begin showing the film in its new digital format
starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   AMC officials, however, are distancing themselves from Fan Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that anything, particularly connected to `Star
Wars,' is a very sensitive issue,'' said Richard Fay, president of
AMC.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said this was the first he'd heard of any individual or
group promoting the movie as an event a month after its opening.
And while the intentions are good, even he had doubts that the
fan-driven campaign could help ``Phantom'' steal ``Titanic's'' top
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting idea, but they've got a long way to go to
do that,'' Fay said. ``But anything is possible, especially, as
I've learned, when it comes to movies.'' &UR;  &QL;

CHICAGO EXPRESSES ANNOYANCE BUT UNDERSTANDING OVER DECISION ON
LOITERING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Calif.)  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For more than 20 years, Bennie Meeks watched out his
apartment window as gang members routinely occupied the nearby
street corner. Sometimes they sold drugs. Sometimes they merely
intimidated, by their very presence.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Meeks, a community leader in the Austin section, on
Chicago's West Side, wanted them out of there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, his Southwest Austin Council and other community groups
finally persuaded the city to enact a law that sought to sweep the
gangs from Meeks' corner and hundreds of others like it. The law,
which ultimately made some difference in his neighborhood and
resulted in more than 42,000 arrests around the city, authorized
police officers to break up groups congregating ``with no apparent
purpose'' and to charge anyone who refused to move on with a
misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   But the Illinois courts suspended enforcement of the law in
1995, and on Thursday the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with them that
it was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-to-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, said
the ordinance was too vague, affording the police too much
discretion and failing to tell potential offenders precisely which
activities were unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, a 65-year-old retired phone company worker, said Friday
that he understood why the court had ruled as it did and that he
hoped a law could be drafted that would resolve the justices'
objections but satisfy the needs of Chicagoans terrified by gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful,'' he said. ``We don't want to give the
police too much power, because I've seen it abused. But if we don't
use this law as a tool, how are we going to get these guys off the
corner? What about the constitutional rights of my neighbors whose
kids have to walk by that corner every day on their way to
school?''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks' concerns were voiced by his neighbors as well and by city
officials who had lobbied hard for the ordinance, saying the rights
of law-abiding people outweighed those of gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the law's fiercest advocate, Mayor Richard M. Daley,
said after learning of the court's decision that ``we have to ask
ourselves if it is constitutional for gang-bangers and drug dealers
to own a corner'' and that ``everybody knows that they aren't out
there cooking hot dogs and studying Sunday-school lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in neighborhoods all over the country,'' the mayor
added, ``are tired of feeling intimidated where they live.''
</P>
<P>
   But like Meeks, Daley said he understood the constitutional
objections, and he vowed that the city would rewrite the law to
meet them. Municipal lawyers said they hoped to have the new
version ready within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much in this decision that we find very
encouraging,'' said Brian Crowe, the Corporation Counsel, who noted
that unlike the Illinois Supreme Court, none of the justices had
found that the ordinance infringed on the First Amendment rights of
freedom of speech and assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court felt the ordinance gave too much discretion to
police officers,'' Crowe said, ``and we're confident we can sit
down and write a new ordinance to meet those parameters.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they gave no details of their approach, city lawyers
said they were particularly encouraged by Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor's concurring opinion, which suggested that such laws could
be rewritten through addition of a more specific definition of
proscribed activity.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities, including San Jose, Calif., have been able to
reduce gang crime by taking the novel approach of suing gang
members as a public nuisance. But the Chicago law, too, was
considered a bold and innovative tool with which to combat urban
violence, and as a result the court's decision was eagerly awaited
by municipalities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that decision, Phil Gordon, who as a city
councilman in Phoenix has led a push for an anti-loitering law
there, said discussions would resume on legislation that was tabled
pending the outcome of the Chicago case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing to see the decision,'' Gordon said, ``but
we'll have to talk with our attorneys and see if there isn't a way
to narrow the scope and see if we can go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes at a time when relations with the police are at
best strained in many Chicago communities. Two recent fatal
shootings by police officers have drawn protests, and many here
approved of the court's objection to a law that gave officers such
broad power.
</P>
<P>
   Among the law's critics was the Chicago office of the American
Civil Liberties Union, which challenged it on behalf of 66
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court said is really what political leaders
in this city should have been saying all along: that you can't
allow the police to determine who is allowed on the street,'' said
Ed Yohnka, director of communications for the Illinois ACLU.
``There are better ways to fight crime than just sweeping people
off of the street, and the court affirmed that.''

WHITE HOUSE STUNNED BY RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House was stunned to learn Friday night
that Russian troops had rolled into Pristina, the Kosovo capital,
after receiving assurances from Moscow all day that its troops
would not move in until NATO had given them a green light.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Friday night whether the Russian maneuver
was an assertion by Russia that it intended to control a sector of
Kosovo, whether this was a rogue act by members of the Russian
military _ perhaps intent on embarrassing pro-Western members of
the leadership in Moscow _ or just a colossal mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia said that the movement of
troops into Pristina was a mistake and that the soldiers had been
ordered to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said that their preliminary
reports confirmed this view, and they indicated that the movement
was not ordered from Moscow and could be reversed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been a cowboy field commander,'' one official
said.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton left the White House for a friend's
engagement party, administration officials went into an emergency
meeting here to try to find out what happened and how they had been
left unaware of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to establish the facts now,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that the administration understood that Russia
had pledged not to deploy ground troops into Kosovo without
coordinating with the NATO-led peacekeeping force under the command
of Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, raising longer-term
political questions about Russia's role in the Kosovo peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last we heard is the Russians have agreed to go in when
General Jackson agrees to take the NATO troops in,'' Gen. Charles
Wald said Friday afternoon in a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Wald indicated that Russian troop movements were being monitored
throughout the day. Asked whether anyone at the Pentagon could say
where the Russian troops were at a given moment, he said, ``Oh, I'm
sure somebody knows where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In a live interview that aired about two hours before news of
the Russian arrival in Pristina, Clinton had appeared confident
that the Russians would stay out of Kosovo until NATO had worked
out a command structure for the peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian movement toward Kosovo, Clinton said, was simply
``prepositioning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians, I think, would like to play a major role but
they understand we have to have unity of command'' under Jackson,
the president said, appearing relaxed and unconcerned about any
Russian betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians drove into Kosovo and through a loophole in the
peace accord that left unresolved the command and control of
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to complete the draft peace resolution for Kosovo,
the Russians were able to keep any mention of NATO out of the body
of the text. What was missing from the final draft was a footnote
to the earlier accord that spelled out how the security force has
``NATO at the core.'' A key sentence describing this as meaning ``a
unified NATO chain of command'' was also missing.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Russian troops outside the allies' control could
jeopardize the return of Kosovo refugees, because many Kosovo
Albanians view Russians as Slavic brethren of the Serbs who
expelled them.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian nationalists and, indeed, many Russian military
officers would balk at Russian peacekeepers' serving under NATO
command, a compromise could be patterned after the mission in
next-door Bosnia, where Russians work in the American sector and
report to a U.S. general who is not the NATO commander there.

   WASHINGTON _ In financial disclosure reports released Friday,
the Senate's leaders, whose salaries are the highest in the
chamber, revealed that their earnings and assets pale in comparison
with some of their multimillionaire colleagues'.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthiest are John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West
Virginia, Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin and Frank R. Lautenberg,
Democrat of New Jersey .
</P>
<P>
   Much of Lautenberg's fortune, for example, is attributed to his
shares of Automatic Data Processing Inc., the payroll services
company that he co-founded. Lautenberg listed the value of his
shares as $5 million to $25 million. He also reported that he had
two blind trusts that together produced income of more than $5
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the Senate's leaders, Trent Lott of Mississippi,
the majority leader, and Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority
leader, listed relatively modest holdings beyond their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lott owns 161 unimproved acres in Mississippi worth less than
$100,000, a one-half partnership in six rental apartments in
Mississippi with a combined value of $50,001 to $100,000 and three
mutual funds each worth $1,001 to $15,000. Most of Lott's assets
are in his wife's name, with a total value of under $50,000. Lott's
wife also owns 60 to 200 shares of two dozen companies, including
General Electric, Nike, Pfizer Corp., MCI WorldCom and Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle, whose wife is a lobbyist, listed a portfolio of two
dozen mutual funds, but only one was worth somewhere between
$50,001 and $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, members of Congress have been required
each year to file broad financial disclosure reports that reveal
that they do not have holdings that pose a conflict of interest
with their jobs. But the rules allow members of Congress to provide
the public with a hazy snapshot of their finances, permitting them
to identify their assets in broad ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Each late spring, the disclosure forms, stacked neatly in
cardboard boxes, are distributed to reporters, who closely
scrutinize the fine print. Next Wednesday, the House of
Representatives will release the disclosure forms of its members.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the senators own mutual funds, rather than
individual stocks. One of the exceptions is Don Nickles, Republican
of Oklahoma, who bought 15 stocks and sold 15 others in 1998. Most
of his trades involved blue-chip companies; among the stocks that
he bought were Citigroup, Coca-Cola, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
McDonalds.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who plans to
retire from the Senate when his term expires next year, drew $1,075
a month from a retirement equities fund that he had contributed to
while he was a university professor. Moynihan has been drawing
retirement income from the account since Aug. 1, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan also listed royalties that he received from four
scholarly books that he has written, but the royalties did not
significantly enhance his net worth. One book, ``Pandemonium,''
brought in $195.92. The other three books earned royalties of
$151.08, $123.74 and $75.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators donate their honorariums to charities. Sen. Robert
G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, gave $500 that he had earned
in a 1998 appearance on the television program ``Politically
Incorrect'' to the Center for Food Action in Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli was one of the few senators to list gifts on his
disclosure form. He listed a ticket to the 1998 U.S. Open Tennis
championship, in Flushing Meadow, N.Y., which he received from a
Democratic Party fund-raiser, Clive Cummis. The ticket was valued
at $250, which exceeded the Senate's $50 gift limit. But Torricelli
qualified for an exemption from the gift rules, saying that he and
Cummis had been personal friends for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six senators from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,
the financial disclosure report of Sen. Charles E. Schumer,
Democrat of New York, was the thinnest. Besides his $129,619
salary, Schumer listed his 401(k) retirement account, valued at
$2,501 to $5,000, as well as several money market accounts, savings
accounts and individual retirement accounts held by him and his
wife. None exceeded $15,000 in value.

RUSSIAN ADVANCE CONFOUNDS NATO'S PLANS FOR ENTERING KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With KOSOVO-RUSSIA, KOSOVO-RUSSIA-TROOPS)

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ NATO's plans for a dawn entry into Kosovo
were confounded early Saturday morning by Russia's unexpected
advance into Pristina, the Kosovo capital and Western forces' goal
as their headquarters for a peacekeeping force to return more than
a million ethnic Albanians to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   British paratroopers were poised to lift off by helicopter at
three o'clock Saturday morning to secure strategic hills
overlooking the highway to Pristina, about 90 kilometers from the
border. The main advance elements of the NATO forces, led by a
British armored force, were to pass the border post at Blace at 5
o'clock .
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian appearance in Pristina, joyously greeted by the
remaining Serbs there, threw the operation into doubt. The Russians
came from the U.N. peacekeeping contingent in Bosnia. Some of their
armored vehicles had the Bosnia peacekeepers insignia, SFOR,
hastily painted over by one letter to read KFOR, the name of the
new Kosovo deployment, while others still bore the old SFOR
designation.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2 a.m. when the stunning news of the Russian operation _
which had seemed to be defused by diplomatic maneuvers during the
day _ reached here, so there was no immediate reaction from NATO
military officials.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been a jittery day, as paratroopers and other troops
stood on alert to go into Kosovo to block the Russians, then stood
down as it appeared the threat had passed, and senior Russian
officials gave their word their troops would not move in.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Russian surprise, NATO tanks rumbled through the
dark, and long columns of armored personnel carriers, ambulances
and other military vehicles snaked through the streets here into
assembly points as British, French, Italian, American and other
NATO contingents gathered to launch their peacekeeping effort.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan called for the advance party of British paratroopers
to take off in helicopters at 3 a.m. to seize the high ground on
the hills overlooking the main road to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   At five o'clock, if all went well, a British officer involved in
the operation said, the main convoy was to pass through the border
crossing here, its advance element led by British troops of the
Fourth Armored Corps, including the Irish Guards and a unit of
tough Ghurka infantrymen. They were to be followed by the other
European and American units, which were to spread across specific
zones in Kosovo as the Serbs withdrew on an 11-day timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's preparations followed a confusing day, in which
Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander here, after already putting
off a dawn paratroop movement for 24 hours _ ostensibly because the
Yugoslavs were having difficulty moving out for lack of gas _ was
confounded by the sudden appearance of Russian peacekeeping troops
from Bosnia moving through Yugoslavia toward Kosovo. They were in
armored vehicles whose SFOR insignia, the initials of the U.N.
deployment there, had been crudely painted over to read KFOR, the
acronym for the peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Paratroopers and other units were stood up on-one hour alerts
late Friday afternoon, but diplomatic efforts then appeared to ease
the crisis, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   This border-crossing point, where hundreds of thousands of
weeping refugees had been dumped off the trains from Pristina, was
so quiet Friday night, a refugee transit camp just down the hill
all but shut down, that the noisy singing of the birds in the
surrounding bushes and woods seemed almost overwhelming. But, just
a few hundred yards back, the KFOR's olive drab military vehicles
were already assembling in the parking lot and cleared spaces
around the Europa `93 Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther back, thousands of refugees in long lines along
the road, kept more or less in order by self-appointed monitors,
cheered the passing NATO military vehicles and anyone that appeared
even vaguely associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   `'NATO, NATO,'' the crowds chanted, quickly following up with
`'UCK, UCK,'' the Albanian initials for the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But when the blue and white cars of the Macedonian police, many
of whom have abused the refugees, passed by, there were high
pitched hoots and jeers.
</P>
<P>
   `'We have waited for this day,'' said 20-year old Bekim
Mustapha, in sentiments echoed by others in the crush around him.

   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ NATO forces kept up their plans for some
British and French paratroopers to enter Kosovo by daybreak
Saturday, despite Russian troops' surprising arrival in the
provincial capital Pristina overnight.
</P>
<P>
   To a celebratory crowd of thousands of jubilant ethnic Serbs,
troop transports and tanks carrying hundreds of Russian troops from
SFOR in Bosnia paraded through downtown Pristina, reassuring the
war-ravaged province's ethnic Serb population that they would be
secure during the NATO peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Russian Prime Minister Igor Ivanov gave
assurances to the Clinton White House that the convoy of some 50
vehicles, which left their peacekeeping mission in Bosnia
unexpectedly to head into Yugoslavia -- but not yet into Kosovo --
would not enter the southern Serb province before NATO did.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on CNN about an hour after their entry, Ivanov said
the troops had arrived ``unfortunately'' and that they had been
ordered to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons for this are being determined. They have been
ordered to leave Kosovo immediately and to await further orders,''
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly embarrassing on a diplomatic level, the movement
by the Russian troops -- traditional allies of the Serbs -- did not
immediately appear to force any change in NATO's schedule for
British and French troops waiting in Macedonia on Kosovo's southern
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why our plans to go in a little bit later will be
affected,'' said a NATO spokesman said after begin told of the news
about 2 a.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Able Sentry, where more than 3,000 U.S. peacekeepers
have gathered to go into Kosovo as part of the United Nations
authorized force, Army spokesman Capt. Mark Ballasteros, said ``I
don't know about all of NATO, but I can tell you that the Americans
aren't moving tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   German television monitored from here showed thousands of
Kosovar Serbs cheering in the streets and waving the Yugoslav flag
and shouting, ``Russia! Russia!'' in anticipation of the arrival of
the Russian troops. The ethnic Serbs also burned an American flag
to show their dissatisfaction with the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians arrived shortly after midnight aboard trucks, tanks
and armored personnel carriers. As they crept through an avenue
jammed with people, the crowd whipped into a frenzy with fireworks
and shots being fired into the air, and people reaching out to
touch the hands of the Russian troops, and showering them with
flowers and chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials said they had been reassured by Russia
that its troops would not be deployed in Kosovo ahead of the
international peacekeeping force, known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're currently trying to get clarification about the facts,''
said White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, NATO commanders gave emergency orders for 2,000
British paratroopers to prepare for an immediate airlift deep into
Kosovo to block Russian peacekeepers that were feared heading for
the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, members of the crack British First Paratroop
Regiment sat sweltering in 95-degree heat beside troop-carrying
helicopters, waiting to jump aboard with their machine guns and
anti-tank rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   This followed reports from Moscow's Interfax news agency that
1,000 Russian troops would leave Moscow Friday afternoon and fly to
cities in Kosovo, including the capital Pristina. Interfax claimed
the Russians were at a military airfield waiting for orders to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   Another report by the Yugoslav news agency Beta said a convoy of
Russian troops had crossed into Serbia from Bosnia on their way to
peacekeeping assignments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Macedonia to visit Kosovar refugees and NATO
troops, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was surprised
when she learned from British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, commander
of KFOR, of the Russian troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   She ordered Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had
just left Moscow, to return to try and revive his talks with
Russian counterparts about the status of a force of up to 10,000
Russian troops within the 50,000-strong peacekeeping force that is
essentially run by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians oppose putting their troops under unified NATO
command, and had backed Belgrade in insisting that the peacekeepers
serve under a United Nations flag, and not simply as a NATO force.

RUSSIANS TROOPS RUMBLE INTO KOSOVO CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Updates with Russians in Pristina.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Throughout the Balkan war, unpredictable, nuclear-armed
Russia has always been the X-factor, and Saturday was no different.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the first foreign power to send troops to Kosovo
since a peace deal suspended 79 days of NATO airstrikes, Russia
trumped the alliance's long-awaited entrance into the southern
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But Moscow's unexpected move to transfer several hundred
peacekeepers from Bosnia into Kosovo's capital, Pristina, means
much more than being first. It may be a signal that the Russians
are determined to play their own game in the resolution of the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders have sought to portray Russia's diplomatic
backing for a peace plan approved by NATO as a sign that Moscow had
joined in the opposition to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials still say that NATO, not Milosevic, was
the aggressor. They say that NATO, as the guilty party in the war,
should not be allowed to command peacekeepers in Kosovo. Russia
wants its troops to take control of a sector in northeast Kosovo
where most of the ethnic Serbs in the region live. NATO rejects
that and says Russia can be part of a unified force under a NATO
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after US and Russian officials in Moscow were unable to
hammer out an agreement on Russia's role in the peacekeepers'
command structure, Friday's move to send in troops looks like a
challenge to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the troops arrived in Pristina, Western leaders
reacted with surprise. British troops near Kosovo were put on alert
and US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott was ordered to turn
his plane around and return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   NATO later appeared to accept assurances from Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov that the troops were not going into Kosovo until a deal
could be worked out. But a senior military official, General Leonid
Ivashov, said Russia reserved the right to make a separate deal
with Belgrade on where its troops will be stationed. Russian news
agencies reported that more troops were ready to arrive in
Yugoslavia soon.
</P>
<P>
   After the troops' arrival, Ivanov, adding to the confusion over
who wields power in Moscow, made a statement calling this ``an
unfortunate incident'' and urging the troops to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic splits and confusion are nothing new to Russian policy
on the Balkans. Most political parties have distanced themselves
from the peace plan, which was helped along greatly by Russia's
envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Parliament this week passed a
resolution accusing Chernomyrdin of betraying Russia's geopolitical
interests.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris N. Yeltsin's comments Friday did not make clear
whether Ivanov or Ivashov was right, only that the Russian leader
still rejects putting his troops under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on television with Ivanov and a Russian general,
Yeltsin growled: ``We have done all we needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing NATO wants is Russian troops staking out
territory in Kosovo. But even if the Russians plan to coordinate
their movements with NATO, their presence in Yugoslavia puts
another crimp in the alliance's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   NATO merely suspended its airstrikes after Yugoslavia accepted a
peace plan that provides for Serbian troops and police to withdraw
from Kosovo. The alliance has held out the threat of resuming the
bombing if the Serbs play any tricks. The presence of even a small
contingent of Russian troops complicates that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Yugoslav troops do not complete the pullout from Kosovo,
will NATO be able to resume bombing with Russian troops in
Yugoslavia?'' a commentator for NTV television asked.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's move may have caught Washington by surprise, but it
appeared to have been planned with the Serbs, who gave the Russian
troops a police escort.
</P>
<P>
   The troops came from among the 1,300 Russian peacekeepers who
have been serving under the NATO-commanded SFOR force, a parallel
NATO officials frequently bring up when trying to persuade the
Russians of their need to command KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian politicians and military officials are suspicious
about NATO's motives. Despite the assurances of the alliance
leaders, many Russians say NATO will be unable, or unwilling, to
prevent the takeover of Kosovo by the rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we even talk about Russian troops, we should ask what
the goal of these peacekeepers is,'' said Russian lawmaker Alexei
Arbatov, a specialist on defense issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to keep Kosovo a part of Serbia, to stop the
violence and allow refugees to return, then we do not need a
heavily armed force like the one NATO is putting in place. We need
50,000 lightly armed troops under the United Nations to act as
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the goal is to divide Serbia and allow the KLA to take
power, we should not be involved in this contingent,'' he said.

UNABLE TO REACH PILOT PAY AGREEMENT, DELTA CANCELS ORDER FOR 777S  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines said Friday that it would defer an order for 11
Boeing 777 aircraft and that it would put two 777's that it already
owns on the market because it could not reach an agreement on pay
scales for flying the airplanes with its pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Delta announced a similar deferral of four 777's in April
because of the dispute. Instead, it took delivery of four 767's.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have asked for $319 an hour to fly the 777, while
Delta has offered them $239 an hour. Delta said the pilots' figure
was 5 percent above what AMR's American Airlines pays pilots to fly
777's, 25 percent higher than UAL's United Airlines pays and 26
percent higher than Continental Airline's rate.
</P>
<P>
   Karen McGuffey, a spokeswoman for the Air Line Pilots
Association, said the pilots deserved more because the 777's were
moneymakers. The planes carry more cargo than other planes, and
their twin-engine design makes the aircraft cheaper to operate than
four-engine aircraft like the Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeking a pay rate commensurate to that productivity,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides, which have met several times since February to
discuss the issue, said they would meet again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing contract terms, Delta has six months to work out
a pay scale with pilots once a new aircraft is introduced. Because
Delta has been flying 777's since May, pilots could decide to stop
flying the new planes after Nov. 1. Ms. McGuffey said the provision
meant the two sides had months to come up with an agreement. But
Delta said that including the planes in its schedule now only to
see them grounded in November could leave thousands of passengers
stranded. In addition, it could cost the company millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, Delta has not canceled its order with Boeing.
Under the terms of its broad, 20-year contract to purchase planes
exclusively from Boeing, Delta has certain options available, such
as substituting orders for other planes.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute comes at a particularly delicate time for Delta and
its pilots, because the two sides are scheduled to begin
negotiations in September on a full-scale contract. But both sides
said Friday that they saw the disagreement about the 777's as a
separate issue from the coming contract negotiations. &QL;

AS TASK FORCE CHIEF, U.N.'S NO. 2 OFFICIAL IS PUT TO TEST
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ It is midafternoon in Kosovo when Louise
Frechette's forces assemble here each morning at 9 sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Around a mahogany conference table in the U.N. situation room
sit the generals of the world organization's peacekeeping army:
heads of U.N. departments and of key relief, refugee, human rights
and peacekeeping agencies that make up an informal group known as
the Kosovo Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   At the head of the table is Ms. Frechette, a Canadian diplomat
who 18 months ago became the first deputy secretary-general,
filling a post created by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frechette quietly set up this group three weeks ago to
coordinate efforts in the Balkans and to begin ``post-conflict''
planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time that all the agencies and departments
involved in such a crisis have been brought together, in person and
by video conferencing,'' said Ms. Frechette. ``There's tremendous
team spirit now.''
</P>
<P>
   This management system will soon be put to its ultimate test.
Under the peace agreement for Yugoslavia hammered out in Cologne,
Germany, 50,000 peacekeepers are to enter Kosovo and the United
Nations is in charge of creating an interim administration for the
war-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   Policing the province, establishing a judicial system, tackling
human rights abuses, institution building, organizing elections and
making possible the return of more than a million refugees are some
of the daunting tasks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much bigger role for the United Nations than
Bosnia,'' said one senior official. ``And thanks in large part to
Louise's planning, I think we're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials also credit Ms. Frechette with
bringing greater discipline and efficiency not only to the
organization's ambitious relief efforts in the Balkans, but to many
of its wide-ranging activities. The United Nations has 5,000
international civil servants in New York alone, from 185 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's become the United Nations' chief operating officer,''
said John Ruggie, who is an assistant secretary-general and a
special adviser to Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Frechette's position grew out of efforts to reform the U.N.
system, which was widely criticized on Capitol Hill and elsewhere
for waste, inefficiency and duplication.
</P>
<P>
   She has taken significant steps, reducing nonessential costs,
streamlining reform-resistant bureaucracies and demanding
accountability from U. N. fiefs that are often entrenched and
unresponsive. In three years, some 900 U.N. posts have been
eliminated, partly as a result of Ms. Frechette's hard-nosed
management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good, strong record of reform,'' said Peter Burliegh,
the acting U.S. representative here.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Frechette is a seasoned diplomat who was based in New
York twice before, she says it was her experience as deputy defense
minister that best prepared her for redefining the U.N.
administration from the top down.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Frechette, 52, runs the morning meetings, which are
normally closed to the press, with almost military precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Human Rights,'' she barks, welcoming the
representative of the Human Rights commissioner's office, who
arrived a few minutes late to a recent meeting via video from
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Also present on television monitors were representatives of the
World Food Program from Rome and senior officials of other U.N.
agencies based in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   On one recent morning Ms. Frechette led a brisk debate over
whether agencies could drop food to people starving in mountain
hideouts in Kosovo, a risky mission in a war zone. The
International Rescue Committee, a private agency, has since made
such airdrops with two leased aircraft from the Italian city of
Pescara and with American government financial support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task force meetings are crucial, because that is where we
all share information,'' said Kofi Asomani, the director of the
liaison office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   That agency alone has more than 350 international relief workers
on the ground in Yugoslavia and neighboring countries, plus
hundreds of local staff members working in refugee camps. They in
turn coordinate their activities with hundreds of private relief
groups and their workers.
</P>
<P>
   The coming weeks are likely to be even more intense for Ms.
Frechette as the U.N. scrambles to prepare for the role of civil
administrator and relief coordinator for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the World Food Program has been preparing to get food
into Kosovo as quickly as possible by providing more than a million
daily rations in Macedonia, Greece and Italy, where more than 30
trucks are ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   The food program has also set up mobile warehouses for food and
has identified five sites in Kosovo where it will set up offices,
with headquarters in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The food program now has enough food in the region to feed some
800,000 refugees for two months and expects to have, within two
weeks, a three-month supply of food for some 600,000 additional
people inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ms. Frechette helps prepare for the task of assuming the
civil administration of the province, she urged the world not to
forget the crises in other parts of the world addressed by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the world won't forget the 1.2 million people
desperately short of food in drought-stricken regions of
Ethiopia,'' she said, ``or the long-suffering people of Sudan,
where we also have had a mission for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that only the United Nations can
do.''

JUVENILE-CRIME BILL SAGS UNDER 200 PIGGYBACKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Mass., Ga., Texas)  (jw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans and Democrats began to file more
than 200 amendments Friday to a juvenile crime bill that has become
a vehicle for the kind of modest but bitterly divisive gun-control
measures that the Senate approved last month.
</P>
<P>
   The number and variety of these amendments, which will be
winnowed to a manageable few before the bill comes to the House
floor next week, provided a glimpse into the gaping range of House
opinion and hinted at the difficulty that lawmakers may have in
passing legislation on such a politically charged issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Friday that the stakes of getting something
through the House were high, with the very credibility of Speaker
Dennis Hastert's leadership on the line.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances over the last few months, Hastert has been
unable to forge a consensus among House Republicans, breeding
protracted debate, intermittent inertia and fears among House
Republicans that they could find themselves lurching into the 2000
elections with the tag of a do-nothing majority.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Hastert has his own promises to keep. He made a
speech on the House floor three weeks ago in which he forecast that
the House would pass some of the kinds of gun-control measures that
succeeded in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   By late this week, however, Hastert sounded less certain as he
announced that he would not press party members to vote in any
particular way and held many of his own opinions in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it could make or break him in terms of the legitimacy
of the rest of his tenure,'' one senior Republican aide said of a
juvenile crime bill with gun-control measures. ``He can't escape
the fact that he went to the floor and said what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The amendments filed Friday with the House Rules Committee went
far beyond gun control. They included one Republican measure that
would give federal permission to post the Ten Commandments in
classrooms and another that would create a new category of
``violently obscene'' entertainment and impose criminal sanctions
on adults who let children have access to the material.
</P>
<P>
   On gun control, the variations in rival amendments brought the
battle lines between advocates and opponents into sharper focus. It
became clearer, for example, that the most spirited fight would
come over the terms and language governing mandatory background
checks of buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pushing for an amendment on shows that replicates
the Senate legislation, which defines those events broadly and
gives vendors three business days to complete checks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, unveiled an alternative that
narrowed the definition of the events and shortened the maximum
time for checks to three calendar days.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democrats denounced that measure as too lenient, many
Republicans found it too harsh. One amendment sent to the House
Rules Committee with the blessing of Republican leaders proposed a
24-hour limit on checks at gun shows. This position dovetailed with
the desires of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   In other instances, Republican leaders were less concerned that
Senate gun-control legislation be watered down than that
Republicans get to vote on each measure, not a package. That way,
Republicans and conservative Democrats would not be forced to vote
against a measure they found palatable because it was coupled with
an unacceptable one.
</P>
<P>
   One senior Republican aide said that Republican leaders wanted
some of these measures to pass not because the leaders felt pressed
by public opinion but because the certain consequence of failure
was that Democrats would try to attach gun-control proposals to any
tangentially relevant spending bill from now on. That disruption
could help shackle Republicans, stopping them from accomplishing
other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also fresh reminders Friday that Democrats were a
long way from unified on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Clinton administration had been pushing for stricter
measures than those the Senate adopted, senior Democratic aides
said Friday that party leaders were aiming simply to replicate the
other chamber's efforts. That decision partly reflected leaders'
fear that some Democrats in rural districts could be hurt in the
elections if the party was too aggressive on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   House members and political analysts also raised concerns Friday
that the potential breadth of the legislation could alienate
lawmakers on the left and the right and leave a center too narrow
for the bill to pass.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many liberal Democrats, including members of the
Congressional Black Caucus, are so opposed to measures that
severely toughen penalties for juvenile crime that they could wind
up voting against a bill that embraced these provisions, even if it
included gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The repulsion outweighs the attraction,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some conservative Republicans are likely to
try to kill the bill if it contains any significant gun control at
all. ``I think its prospects are very gloomy right now,'' said Rep.
Bob Barr, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno both spoke out
again Friday in favor of Democratic gun-control proposals,
continuing to use their bully pulpits to pressure lawmakers in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility of the issue was also evident on the presidential
campaign trail. More than 100 demonstrators gathered outside a
Chicago hotel, the site of a fund-raising reception for Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, urging him to take a stronger stand on gun
control.

LAKERS CAN'T LET JACKSON GET AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Lakers can think of 20 million
reasons not to hire Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can they give us one good reason?
</P>
<P>
   The news is out, and it comes as a shock to nobody with the
possible exception of Kurt Rambis, who might have been under the
impression he's the Lakers' head coach.
</P>
<P>
   The team's front office has been talking to Jackson's agent
about a contract.
</P>
<P>
   This makes it more than wistful speculation that the man who
coached the Chicago Bulls' volatile mix of Michael Jordan, Scottie
Pippen and Dennis Rodman to a handful of NBA championship rings
will try to do the same with the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant and Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Good news for Lakers fans. But keep the champagne on ice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the unanswered questions in this week's reports is whether
Jerry Buss, the owner, and Jerry West, the executive vice
president, are serious about hiring the best available coach for
their talented players.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know how long the two sides have been talking. Days?
Weeks?
</P>
<P>
   We don't know exactly what changed since last week, when it
sounded as if Rambis was about to have the ``interim'' label
removed from his coaching suit. Did Jackson watch the New York
Knicks save Jeff Van Gundy and figure his best chance for a
big-city job lay in Los Angeles? Did Buss and West note the
lukewarm support for Rambis among the players and the public and
wave a bigger check book at Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   And we don't know where the Lakers-Jackson negotiations stand _
that's for them to know and for us to find out _ let alone where
they go from here. What does Jackson want from the Lakers other
than more money? What do the Lakers want from Jackson other than a
vow of poverty?
</P>
<P>
   Which is where those 20 million reasons come in.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about a salary in the $5 million to $6 million
range. That's $20 million to $24 million for four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money, especially to the Lakers, who were paying
Del Harris about $1.2 million a year and Rambis much less than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it a lot of money? I mean, compared to what?
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the $120 million they've committed to O'Neal?
Compared to the $70 million they're paying to Bryant? Compared to
the $40 million-plus it would take to make Rice happy?
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of money, especially if all you're getting for it
is swept out of the playoffs year after year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' stated goal is nothing short of a championship.
Their fans expect nothing less. And now, as they move into the
downtown Staples Center, with more seats to fill, creating optimism
after 11 title-less seasons is wiser than ever.
</P>
<P>
   What the Lakers need is a coach with a record of turning talent
into a title. If that coach can be theirs for $24 million, he looks
like a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   What's the alternative?
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Daly? No. He just walked away from coaching the Orlando
Magic to earn his paychecks in the consulting racket.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Daly will be 69 years old next month. Some jobs are
just right for a man that age. President of the United States, for
example. But coaching the Lakers? Too stressful.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy? No. After looking like the NBA's leading candidate to
be fired, he's the toast of New York during the Knicks' unlikely
playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if you don't have to, you don't trust your $200 million
roster to a coach who's never actually won anything.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Rambis, who's coached a grand total of 28 NBA
victories. If Jackson is a bargain, Rambis is the bargain basement.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the old Lakers forward say it would be unfair to pull
the coaching chair out from under him after a 46-game trial in
which he had to deal with the arrival of Rodman, the two-for-three
Rice trade and the scarcity of practice time in the
lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   It's innocent-until-proven-guilty applied to basketball: Rambis
did nothing wrong, you can't fire him.
</P>
<P>
   But in his first head-coaching job at any level of the sport,
Rambis also did nothing to prove he'll be as clever a coach as the
Lakers evidently need.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping Rambis, Buss and West would risk enduring another
season of on-the-job training for the coach and another season of
missed opportunity for the players.
</P>
<P>
   And that mistake couldn't be corrected a year from now. Jackson
probably won't be available then. And other than Pat Riley, who is
not coming back to Los Angeles, there isn't a more attractive
coaching candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's credentials improved, if anything, during his season
out of the game. The Bulls broke up, with Jackson and Jordan first
out the door, and the rest of them struggled with their new teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen averaged 14 points a game with the Houston Rockets, five
less than he scored while sharing the ball with Michael. Rodman _
need I say?
</P>
<P>
   Blame the loss of Jordan for some of that. Blame the loss of
Jackson for the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Buss has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to build a
roster of players as talented as the Bulls'. Now, for a few million
more, he can have the coach to match.
</P>
<P>
   It's no time to be cheap.

 &HT;    Christian Coalition skips Wicca boycott
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Conservative religious groups calling for
Christians to join a nationwide recruiting boycott against the Army
lost some of their ammunition Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.1 million-member Christian Coalition announced that the
organization will not tell its members to participate in the Army
boycott, which was called to protest the Army's policy of allowing
Wiccans to practice their rituals on posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Coalition doesn't tell its members what to do on
personal issues of faith,'' spokeswoman Molly Clatworthy said. ``As
individuals, Christian Coalition members may support the boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the American Family Association _ listed as one of
13 groups that originally called for the boycott _ withdrew its
support.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M. Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, said
Friday he was disappointed in the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Washington-based representatives for both groups signed onto the
boycott earlier in the week, Weyrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held a coalition meeting, laid out our game plan and asked
people to sign on,'' Weyrich said. ``A couple of these groups
either misunderstood what was being advocated or got cold feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for a boycott came after publicity stemming from an
Austin American-Statesman story last month about Wiccans at Fort
Hood in Killeen. The Army installation for three years has
sanctioned a Wicca group by providing on-post space for rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Wiccans, who call themselves witches, celebrate cycles of the
sun and moon and believe in the dual deity of god and goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Sue Lia Perkes writes for the Austin American-Statesman.

   DOW JONES AVERAGE DROPS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average declined for a fourth
consecutive day after economic reports deepened investors' concerns
that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates later this
month. The Dow average fell 130.76 points, or 1.23 percent, to
10,490.51.
</P>
<P>
   Other market gauges also dropped. The Nasdaq composite index,
which includes many computer issues, declined 36.74 points, or 1.48
percent, to 2,447.88, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
decreased 9.18 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,293.64.
</P>
<P>
   COMPANIES FIGHT COMPUTER ATTACKS
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and other big companies worldwide scrambled to halt the
spread of a malicious computer program that began infecting
computers in Israel on Monday and spread rapidly into Europe and
the United States, carried by e-mail. It destroys files created by
Microsoft programs, including Word and Excel, and infects entire
networks.

   The popular online auction service eBay experienced one of the

   HECHINGER SET TO CLOSE 89 STORES
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement chain Hechinger filed for bankruptcy
protection and plans to close 89 stores to focus on its healthier
117 outlets. Separately, Kmart said it would reduce its earnings by
about $230 million because it had guaranteed the leases on the
Builders Square chain, which it sold to a venture that was combined
with Hechinger two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN TO CREATE 700,000 JOBS
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at a postwar high of 4.8 percent, the Japanese
government announced a plan to create more than 700,000 jobs. The
measures would include offering subsidies to emerging industries
like biotechnology and telecommunications. But the government did
not say how much it intended to spend, making it difficult to
assess the plan's potential for stimulating the economy.
</P>
<P>
   DELTA DELAYS AIRCRAFT ORDER
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines said that it would defer an order for 11 Boeing
777 aircraft and that it would put two 777s that it already owned
on the market because it could not reach an agreement with its
pilots on pay scales for flying the airplanes. The pilots, calling
the 777s moneymakers, have asked for $319 an hour to fly the 777,
while Delta has offered them $239 an hour.

   TRADE VICTORY FOR AMERICAN STEEL
</P>
<P>
   The International Trade Commission, a federal agency, handed
U.S. steel producers an important victory, approving punitive

administration within weeks.

   TRACKING PETS BY MICROCHIPS
</P>
<P>
   Microchips are reuniting lost pets with their owners. At least
1.6 million American dogs and cats now have identifying chips the
size of a grain of rice implanted in their shoulders, and three
manufacturers _ Home Again, Infopet and Avid _ are working to
develop an industry standard. Now, some people suggest, the same
technology could be used at hospitals to be sure babies are not
switched and later to help find children who are lost or kidnapped.

EDITORIAL: INDONESIA'S TENTATIVE DEMOCRACY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   After 44 years of scripted elections and stultifying military
rule, the people of the world's fourth-largest country, Indonesia,
got their chance at real democracy this week. They grasped it
enthusiastically. Fears of violence proved unfounded. Press
coverage was admirably free. On Monday more than 100 million
Indonesians, 90 percent of those eligible, cast ballots for
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, delays in the vote count have now raised fears of
possible manipulation. Any such tampering would have disastrous
consequences, undermining Indonesia's prospects for political
stability and economic recovery. There are, however, other
plausible explanations for the slowdown, and international monitors
and opposition parties have so far refrained from condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   With some 20 percent of the vote now tallied, the front-runner
is the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or PDIP, led by
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's first president,
Sukarno, and a leading presidential candidate herself. President
B.J. Habibie's military-backed Golkar party is hovering between
second and third, well behind Mrs. Megawati's party. Projections
suggest that the PDIP will probably end up ith the largest
parliamentary delegation. With 48 parties fielding candidates, no
one group is likely to win a clear majority.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's next president will be chosen this fall by a special
assembly made up of the 462 newly elected members of Parliament, 38
delegates nominated by the armed forces and 200 others chosen by
local assemblies and designated interest groups. In this assembly
the military and its Golkar allies may try to use bribery, backroom
dealing or intimidation to impose their own favorite candidate
despite the opposition parties' strong showing this week. General
Wiranto, the armed forces commander who last year played a helpful
role in easing Indonesia's long-serving dictator, Suharto, from
power must make sure that his fellow officers do not try to
overturn the voters' choice.
</P>
<P>
   The next president's priority task will be to lead Indonesia out
of the economic crisis that has thrown 20 million of its people
into poverty since 1997. That will require rebuilding a shattered
banking system, cleaning up the crony business empires set up
during the long Suharto dictatorship and regaining the trust of
international investors. The next president must also spark enough
growth to rebuild drastically reduced tax revenues so that the
government can resume paying its bills. It will help if some of the
illicit billions allegedly amassed by the Suharto family can be
recovered. The Clinton administration is rightly looking into
whether any such money is now being held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Megawati has been vague about her economic plans beyond
rejecting the Socialism favored by her father and embracing the
market. Habibie, her likely rival, has long been associated with
Suharto and his business cronies. Indonesians deserve to have the
hope and enthusiasm they showed during this election vindicated.
There must be a clean break from the electoral manipulations of the
past and from the failed economic policies of both the Sukarno and
the Suharto eras.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Breaking assurances given to Washington,
a long column of Russian peacekeeping troops entered Kosovo and its
capital early Saturday morning amid scenes of wild celebration by
local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said that the
movement of the troops into the Kosovo capital, hours before NATO
peacekeepers were to have entered the Serbian province, was a
mistake and that the soldiers would be ordered to leave. In
Washington, Clinton administration officials went into an emergency
meeting to try to find out what had happened and how they had been
left unaware of the movement.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian solder, Yevgeny Sadovsky, said: ``We came from Bosnia,
from Tuzla, and Ugljevik, and we are supposed to stay here for two
weeks, and then go back to Bosnia. We just came to prepare the
airport for our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people packed the streets of Pristina to welcome
the Russian troops, firing pistols and automatic weapons into the
air and throwing flowers on Russian armored personnel carriers and
jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Yvonne Stankovic, one of the Serbs
celebrating here. ``It may not be victory, but it shows NATO we are
not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ilija Karalic: ``The United States is not the only country
in the world. Our Russian brothers are here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians arrived in a column of some 50 military vehicles
and trucks as NATO peacekeeping forces on the border with Macedonia
prepared to move into Kosovo later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The unilateral Russian entry into Kosovo is sure to cause a new
crisis with Washington. It came despite promises on Friday from
Ivanov, the foreign minister, that Russia's troops would not enter
the province before NATO did.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov told CNN Saturday morning: ``The reasons for this are
being determined. They have been ordered to leave Kosovo
immediately and to await further orders.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium, said Saturday morning
that he had no details about the Russian action.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had been shocked earlier by reports that Russian
troops from Russia's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia had moved on
Friday through Yugoslavia and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and
might be heading south to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore had publicly said Friday that the
Russians would not move before NATO did. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott, who was flying from Moscow to Brussels after talks
broke down on how NATO and Russian forces would interact in Kosovo,
turned his airplane around and headed back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, while seeking to have Russians
help solve the diplomatic crisis, had failed to negotiate a serious
peacekeeping role for the Russians under the U.N. mandate on
Thursday authorizing foreign troops to move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had refused to serve directly under NATO command
and had backed Belgrade in insisting that the peacekeepers serve
under a U.N. flag, and not simply as a NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials stressed on Friday that 30 nations wanted to
participate in the Kosovo force, known as KFOR, a more
representative grouping than the 19 nations of NATO that waged a
78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, the crowd in Pristina fired hundreds of rounds
of ammunition into the air, kissed the Russian soldiers and jumped
upon their armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   They shouted slogans like, ``Serbia, Russia,'' ``Yeltsin,
Yeltsin, Yeltsin'' and ``We and the Russians, we are 300 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd shouted insults aimed at the United States
and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers displayed the three-fingered Serbian salute
before the column moved off to the south, either toward Pristina's
airport or the Gratanica Monastery, one of the Serbian Orthodox
Church's holiest sites.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops had painted over the SFOR on their vehicles _
the acronym for the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia _ with KFOR, the
name of the Kosovo peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and the Serbs, both Slavic peoples, also share
similar Orthodox faiths. While Yugoslav officials feel Moscow is
pursuing its own interests here, they are nonetheless glad to have
public support from Moscow and to embarrass the NATO alliance,
which had negotiated a peace that felt to Yugoslavs like a
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, during the war with NATO, Russia refused to provide
Belgrade with significant aid or even to lift sanctions. There is
no great love between Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, and the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. Russia's special envoy for
the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin, was an important factor in
getting Milosevic to agree to the bulk of NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, inspired by a message on local television
here that Russian forces would arrive at 10 p.m., about 3,000 local
Serbian residents gathered in the main square here to greet the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, boisterous and noisy, waved Serbian and Yugoslav
flags and burned an American one. The sound of gunfire, from shots
fired into the air from balconies and the streets, sounded like an
infantry invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, however, did not arrive until about 1:30 a.m.,
when there were still nearly 2,000 people in the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian move is not likely to comfort the ethnic Albanians
who have remained in Pristina or the nearly 1 million who were
pushed out of their homes by the Serbs. They are likely to be less
eager to return quickly to Kosovo from the refugee camps, and that
may have been one of Belgrade's ideas when it allowed the Russians
to move in.

EDITORIAL: GUN GAMES IN THE HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 12:
</P>
<P>
   With the gun control issue careening toward a probable showdown
on the House floor next week, Republicans need to decide whether
their fealty to the gun lobby will lead them to ignore the public's
demand for strong Congressional action to keep guns away from
children and criminals. Americans will not be fooled by halfway
measures, some of them watered-down versions of the provisions
approved last month by the Senate. The gun package introduced by
Rep.s Henry J. Hyde and Bill McCollum requires significant
strengthening if the House speaker, Dennis Hastert, is to fulfill
his promise of last month to make meaningful progress on gun
control. Yet Hastert seems reluctant to confront Republicans trying
to further weaken the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The hand of the National Rifle Association is most evident in
the watering down of a provision in the Senate bill that would
require mandatory background checks for all buyers at gun shows.
Under the House proposal, the definition of gun shows has been
altered to exempt shows with fewer than 10 vendors, even if
thousands of guns are sold. The House language also weakens the
Senate's record-keeping requirements, making tracing of firearms
sold at gun shows all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The language also eases present restrictions in current law on
interstate gun shipments, gives vendors new protection from civil
liability and exempts gun-show vendors who sell their wares from
rolling carts from conducting any criminal background checks at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposal at least gives law enforcement 72 hours to
complete the background check for gun-show purchases, which is
better than the 24-hour limit the NRA aggressively lobbied for. But
that is less than the three business days provided in the Senate
bill _ a critical difference since most gun shows take place on
weekends, when court files needed to confirm convictions are
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the Republican House proposal would increase
the legal minimum age for all handgun purchases to 21 from 18 _ a
provision opposed by the NRA and absent from the Senate bill. But
for some reason, the proposal stops short of also raising the age
for handgun possession. In addition, House Republicans managed to
come up with an even weaker child safety lock requirement than the
one that passed the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there is still a chance to improve upon the flawed
proposals now on the table. The open question is whether Hastert
and his colleagues will allow that to happen. The public deserves a
full debate on the provisions in the bill and Democratic and
Republican proposals to strengthen them. Hastert should promptly
instruct the Rules Committee, which will meet early next week to
decide the debate's format, that he means to allow a thorough
airing and recorded votes on the full range of gun control issues.

SPORTS COLUMN: VALENTINE ISSUED A FOOLISH CHALLENGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa., Toronto, Mass.)  (jw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to Friday's National League edict, Bobby Valentine,
the Mets' manager, has been suspended for two games for ``the
violation of rule 5.1'' during Wednesday night's 4-3 victory over
the Toronto Blue Jays in 14 innings _ not remaining in the
clubhouse until the game ended after having been ejected. He also
was fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Valentine was suspended and fined for brazen
stupidity _ appearing briefly on the steps below the dugout in a
disguise: mustache, sunglasses, a black cap and a black Mets
T-shirt, after having been ejected in the 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday night's game with the Red Sox, Valentine explained
that he had been trying to ``lighten'' the mood on the Mets with
his disguise. And as the Mets did their stretching exercises at
Shea Stadium, some wore eyeblack strips as mustaches.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has appealed his ban ``just to discuss it'' early next
week with Leonard Coleman Jr., the NL president, who lightened the
manager's wallet. But what's there to discuss? Through the years,
other ejected managers remained hidden in the runway and issued
instructions without being disciplined, but with his disguise
Valentine foolishly challenged Coleman's authority, especially
after a television cameraman spotted him. Coleman couldn't ignore
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza told me, `I think that camera's got you,' ''
Valentine recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At the far end of the Blue Jays' dugout, the cameraman focused
on Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I was,'' Valentine was saying now, as if
describing a crime scene, as he stood on the steps below the Mets'
dugout. ``On this step, that's as far as I went and then I leaned
back against the wall for a few seconds. How long was I there?
Seconds. It might have been a little more than seconds, but I never
saw a play. I never saw a pitch. I don't know how the camera seemed
to have me sitting in the dugout. I never went up into the
dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine acknowledged, ``It was a mistake'' that would cost him
a few dollars. And unless Coleman shortens the suspension, it will
cost the Mets their manager for two games.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets make a run for the wild-card berth in the NL
playoffs, Valentine's disguise caper will quickly be forgotten. But
if they remain on a treadmill to another disappointing season
without a playoff berth, it will be remembered as another bizarre
incident that could contribute to his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, tightly wound and sensitive to criticism, has a habit
of creating more controversies than he defuses, notably his stormy
relationship with Todd Hundley, now with the Dodgers, and this
week's squabble with Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fourth season as the Mets' manager after eight with
the Texas Rangers, he should know better than to try to stand on
the edge of the dugout in a laughable disguise. The smiles he got
from his players weren't worth a two-game ban.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Valentine, like every other manager, has
stood in the runway below the dugout after being ejected. ``I've
heard of managers coming back as part of the ground crew, or
sitting in a front-row seat and giving signs,'' he said. ``Or
sitting in the bleachers with binoculars, or standing behind a
photographer or a TV cameraman.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda, the former Dodgers manager, remembered being
ejected, then putting on a trench coat, a hat and glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat on the bench for three innings and none of my players
realized I was there,'' Lasorda said. ``But that was an exhibition
game with the Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Other managers have been more subtle, or more secretive, about
issuing instructions after an ejection.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Leo Durocher, then managing the New York Giants, was
ejected from a game in Pittsburgh, then dressed, went up to the
Forbes Field press box and sat behind Barney Kremenko of The New
York Journal-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're giving the signs,'' Durocher said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the signs,'' Kremenko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just do what I tell you,'' Durocher said.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the clubhouse, Durocher had got word to his
third-base coach to watch Kremenko in the press box. As the game
progressed, Durocher told Kremenko, for example, to touch his right
shoulder or his left shoulder, to raise his right arm or his left
arm. But to ease an itch, Kremenko suddenly scratched his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barney, what did you do?'' Durocher yelled. ``That's the steal
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a Giant was caught stealing. Kremenko did not
scratch his nose again. And if Bobby Valentine is as smart as he
thinks he is, he won't wear a disguise again. &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. SCHOOLS ARE RESEGREGATING, SAYS CIVIL RIGHTS REPORT
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The separation of whites from African Americans and
Latinos in public schools has increased in the 1990's, according to
a new report from the Civil Rights Project at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this century nears its end, we are a decade into the
resegregation of our nation's schools,'' said the report released
Friday by Gary Orfield and John T. Yun.
</P>
<P>
   They reported that in 1970 the typical African-American student
attended a school in which 32 percent of the students were
non-Latino whites. That white percentage peaked at 36 percent in
1986, and fell steadily to 32.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For the typical Latino student, the proportion of non-Latino
whites in the same school dropped steadily from nearly 44 percent
in 1970 to 33 percent in 1980 and fell to 29.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The result: While the average white student goes to a school
where fewer than 20 percent of the students are minorities, the
average student of African, Latino, Asian or Native American
heritage goes to a school where most students are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said the racial gap grew due to the faster
growth of the student population among racial minorities, and the
tendency of Americans to live near people of their own race and
income level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the Clinton administration has seen the largest
increases in segregation in the last half century, it has proposed
no policies to offset the trend and has not included the issue
among its priorities for education policy,'' said the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to look at is broader than that,'' responded
Julie Green, chief spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Education. ``We want to help parents get choices in where they send
their children to have an education, and make sure our resources
are targeted to the most disadvantaged students to level the
playing field, so all children can learn to high standards.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Yun said programs that allow children to transfer to
magnet schools or charter schools within or even outside of their
districts have failed to break the racial patterns in which large
numbers of racial minorities end up in the same schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're concentrating poverty and its consequences into a
single school, and attempts to counter all those influences at once
is extremely difficult,'' Yun said in an interview. ``It's most
intense in the inner cities, but it's spreading now into the
suburbs, especially in large metropolitan areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said schools with lots of poor children often perform below
par because they tend to have fewer parents with higher education,
a smaller selection of advanced courses, fewer teachers with
credentials in the subject they are teaching, more dropouts and
more untreated health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also miss out on the enriching social and cultural
exchanges that could take place if you put more students from
different races and income levels into the same schools,'' Yun
said.

KINGS COACHING CANDIDATES FACE LONG WEEKEND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Memorial Day is over, and the Fourth of July is
three weeks away, but this will be a long weekend for the Los
Angeles Kings' two remaining coaching candidates and for general
manager Dave Taylor, who has an important decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has been choosing not to speak with reporters
recently, narrowed his list of candidates Thursday to Long Beach
Ice Dogs coach John Van Boxmeer and former Canadian national team
coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, before leaving Los Angeles for a coaching clinic in
Calgary, the 48-year-old Murray said he is trying to keep his
nerves in check as he awaits Taylor's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this process before,'' said Murray, a
finalist for the Mighty Ducks' job a year ago. ``It's the same as
coaching: You just do your best. There are certain things that are
out of your control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only 28 of these jobs. They're tough to come by.
It's something everybody aspires to. In my career, I aspired to
coach the Canadian national team. There's only one of those jobs.
It's always been my goal to coach at the NHL level. I would enjoy
the opportunity to coach in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray spent this season coaching Shattuck St. Mary's, a
Minnesota prep school, to a national championship. Murray is
scheduled to return home to Minnesota on Sunday, and Taylor's
decision is expected to come either this weekend or early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Such Kings players as Rob Blake, Garry Galley and Ray Ferraro
have played for Murray at various levels of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Murray has been an assistant coach with the Philadelphia Flyers,
the Winnipeg Jets (now the Phoenix Coyotes) and the Minnesota North
Stars (now the Dallas Stars). He also won an American Hockey League
title as a head coach in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he also is in the running for two other NHL jobs,
and though he wouldn't disclose where, it is believed the Coyotes
and expansion Atlanta Thrashers are interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the Kings) have some things to think over,'' Murray
said. ``I have some things to think over, also. Obviously, I
appreciate the opportunity to interview and be considered for the
job. This situation really excites me and I'm really impressed with
the people I met.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said he has not been offered a contract, and it is
believed the Kings have not discussed a contract with Van Boxmeer,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his style, Murray said, ``I'm known as a
demanding coach. I don't ever believe that effort is optional. I
believe you get from people what you expect of them. Every player
thrives on discipline. I think you have to be clear on explaining
what you want. Then, I think you have to be very strong on the
level of accountability, as well.''

LAKERS MIGHT HAVE A COACH WITH THEIR OFFER TO JACKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though an agreement has yet to be signed, Phil Jackson appears
to be honing in on taking over the Los Angeles Lakers for a deal
believed to be worth nearly $30 million over five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the team nor Jackson's agent, Todd Musburger, has
confirmed the two sides have reached a deal. Jackson, who coached
the Chicago Bulls to six championships, is fishing for king salmon
with family members in Alaska over the weekend. But Lakers
president Jerry West confirmed the Lakers had made contact with
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to deny the fact that we've talked to Phil
Jackson about coaching the Lakers next season,'' West said in a
prepared statement. ``With the success he's had in the NBA, he's
definitely an attractive candidate. However, we're exploring
several possibilities with different individuals and no decision
has been made yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential hiring of Jackson, who has not coached since
guiding the Bulls to their third straight title last season, is
expected to create a domino effect among the league's coaching
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   With the most-sought-after candidate nearing a deal, the
possibility that the Nets' interim coach, Don Casey, will remain in
New Jersey as the head coach increases. Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy, who dealt with the specter of Jackson looming as a possible
replacement for him for much of the season, would also gain a good
measure of job security.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, nor West has met face to
face with Jackson, but the two parties are scheduled to meet early
next week. Jackson is planning to be in Los Angeles on Wednesday
with Bill Bradley, his friend and former teammate who is running
for president. They will be in town for a campaign fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   According to an Eastern Conference team official with knowledge
of Jackson's plans, the former Bulls coach was genuinely interested
in coaching the Lakers, the Nets and the Knicks, but firmly
believed the Laker job had more upside based solely on talent.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 10 days ago, persons close to Jackson believed that
he would not return to the game next season and instead take one
more year off.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment seemed to grow as Jackson's leverage with New
York seemed to decline; the Knicks turned their season around,
qualified for the playoffs and made a stunning run to the Eastern
Conference finals, with Van Gundy earning widespread support among
the team's fans.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson spurned a lucrative offer from the Nets, believed
to be in the neighborhood of $20 million over three seasons, it
became apparent his only viable option would be with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   If the two sides agree in principle over the next few days, the
decision by the club to dole out such a lucrative contract to a
coach is a major shift in management style for the Lakers. Less
than three weeks ago, team officials were privately discounting
Jackson as a candidate, based on the fact that Buss rarely spends a
fortune for coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Kurt Rambis, the interim coach who has been a loyal team
employee since he retired as a player, was thought to have a fair
shot of returning _ if for no other reason than he only had three
months with the underachieving team after he replaced Del Harris at
midseason.
</P>
<P>
   A year after they were swept in four games by the Utah Jazz in
the Western Conference finals, the Lakers were swept in the
conference semifinals this season by the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond on-court chemistry problems and an off-floor feud between
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers' acquisition of Dennis
Rodman turned into a disaster, with the unreliable rebounder
finally released by the team after a chaotic two months.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Rambis would return with the team and in
what capacity he might serve.
</P>
<P>
   En route to six championships in eight seasons, Jackson
assembled a regular-season winning percentage of .738 (545-193) in
his nine seasons as the Bulls' head coach. Named coach of the year
in 1996, he holds the National Basketball Association playoff
record for best winning percentage (.730).
</P>
<P>
   He was also a backup forward of the Knicks' last championship
team, in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's informal meeting with Madison Square Garden president
Dave Checketts in mid-April seemed to indicate a sincere interest
by the Knicks in bringing Jackson back to the franchise for which
he had played 11 seasons. But Checketts and Jackson never spoke
again about the possibility of becoming the Knicks' coach after
that meeting.  &QL;

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Basketball legend Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson and
Starbucks boss Howard Schultz brought their inner-city road show to
Seattle's Columbia City neighborhood Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They opened the latest in their 50-50 joint-venture Starbucks
Coffee stores and Johnson said there will be more in Seattle, along
with one of Johnson's multiplex movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz's Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Co. and Johnson's Los
Angeles-based Johnson Development Corp. have recently opened
similar Starbucks coffee stores in West Los Angeles and New York's
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 residents of the South Seattle Columbia City
community turned out to catch a glimpse of the retired National
Basketball Association superstar who became a top-flight business
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him on TV playing with Michael Jordan in the Olympics,''
said Michael Davis, 6.
</P>
<P>
   His mom, Sheree Davis, brought Michael and his stepbrother,
Forrest Britt, 5, to the store at the corner of Rainier Avenue
South and South Edmunds Street to see Johnson and, perhaps pick up
his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this will mean jobs for the neighborhood and will help
other businesses come in and help the area become stable,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Schultz said that along with making a profit, a
major goal of their venture is helping the community by showing
other companies that it is good business to bring services to inner
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a balance at what business can be and it's
not only to show a profit but to show some benevolence and give
back,'' Schultz said. ``We hope other national retailers will come
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said giving pride to the community, bringing ``a first
class'' retailer and supplying jobs are among his goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the community here deserves this,'' Johnson said. ``We
want what everybody else wants and that's the best of the best _
and today you have the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that the millions of dollars he earned during his
13-year professional basketball career financed his businesses and
insisted he runs his five-company empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hands-on boss,'' he said. ``I go over the numbers every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   His businesses include movie theaters, a retail mall, television
and children's multimedia production companies, a concert and
boxing promotion company, a record label and controlling interest
in a Los Angeles bank.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Johnson, a Columbia City resident, agreed that bringing
the Starbucks store to the neighborhood could bring jobs and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will bring more businesses into Columbia City,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone welcomed the new Starbucks store, however.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a man passed out leaflets charging Starbucks ``exploits
prison labor.'' A Starbucks spokeswoman said she knew nothing about
the charges and couldn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   A block south, at the year-old Lottie Motts Espresso Shop,
Autumn Eaton paused between making lattes to say she is
``disappointed'' that Starbucks will be a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz earlier said that Starbucks stores ``enlarge the
coffee-drinking community and there is usually enough business for
all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell what the effect will be here,'' Eaton
said.

REGIONAL ORCHESTRAS FACE PERILOUS EXISTENCE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Va.)  (jw) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Although they make no claims that their
orchestra rivals the New York Philharmonic or the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, the musicians and patrons of the Hudson Valley
Philharmonic can dream as gaudily as anyone. A year ago, they
dreamed of creating a summer home for the orchestra that might
become another Tanglewood.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vision as idyllic as Beethoven's ``Pastoral'' Symphony,
with concerts on the verdant lawn of a country club in Dutchess
County where lovers and families could picnic to the strains of
Tchaikovsky while fireworks illuminated the night.
</P>
<P>
   But the execution turned into something closer to Wagner's
``Gotterdammerung.'' At the opening concert on the evening of July
4, a rainstorm struck, flooding the stage, forcing the musicians to
flee, dimming the outdoor lights and sending thousands of soaked
spectators scurrying for cover. In the pandemonium, shuttle buses
filled with concertgoers trying to escape slid into one another on
the muddy field, while someone fired off the fireworks in an
incongruous effort to light up the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse. Publicity about the debacle was blamed for
hurting the box-office take of the subsequent concerts. The
orchestra found itself grappling with an entrepreneur who had
promised to pay all the bills and was now stalling, just as
creditors said he had done in a history of sour deals that seemed
to have escaped the attention of the orchestra's board.
</P>
<P>
   The swamp of debt soon reached $617,189, forcing the orchestra
to dismiss most of its administrative staff and, in April, to file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the Bardavon 1869 Opera House in Poughkeepsie, the
orchestra's principal home, had taken over the orchestra's assets
and administration. In the process, the philharmonic had to
surrender its 40-year-old independence as an institution and
eliminate concerts in Kingston and Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the lush, rolling hills, tranquil dairy farms and weathered
cities where its audience resides, the orchestra has pained and
bitterly divided its devotees with its near-death experience.
Musicians and a few board members are angry not only at Francis
Zarro Jr., the sometimes grandiose entrepreneur, but also at board
leaders _ including a bank executive _ for not exercising common
prudence and rejecting a deal that eventually compelled the
orchestra to put up money for the production costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that people who are conservative would have
allowed themselves to be sweet-talked into something like this,''
said Susan Seligman, the orchestra's principal cellist.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley's summer fiasco has drawn attention to the
hand-to-mouth existence of the nation's regional orchestras. These
ensembles play the live classical music most Americans hear, but
they walk a much more perilous tightrope than do orchestras in
large cities where money, musicians and music lovers are more
plentiful. There are at least 600 classical orchestras in the
United States, and all but 50 are on the scale of the Hudson
Valley, with limited seasons and annual budgets of less than $2
million, according to the American Symphony Orchestra League.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley Philharmonic has 65 musicians, usually
performs about 15 concerts a season and has a budget of $1 million.
The New York Philharmonic has 107 full-time musicians, a season of
126 performances and a budget of $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley's musicians are the next rung down on the
professional ladder, conservatory-trained musicians who spend their
days scrambling to stitch together their livelihoods. Blair
Tindall, the orchestra's principal oboist, has been known to play
at a Saturday matinee of ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway, then drive
up the Taconic Parkway and arrive in Poughkeepsie in time for the
philharmonic's evening concert. She earns $100 a performance and
$25 a rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has substituted in the New York Philharmonic, she
knows she will probably never work there full time, since it has
only four oboists and a slot may open up once a decade. Like many
of her colleagues, she has idealistic notions about the importance
of regional orchestras in small cities and whistle-stops where
their concerts may provide a rare chance for aspiring musicians to
hear the classical canon live or for residents to savor an elegant
night out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like virtually all regional orchestras, the Hudson Valley
Philharmonic has always struggled to balance its books. But its
current troubles began with an enticing proposition. In 1997,
Zarro, 48, a Bronx-bred lawyer who had just bought the Island Green
Country Club in Amenia, N.Y., proposed a summer concert series at
the club to the orchestra's administrative director, RoseMarie
Freni. He said concerts on the club's bowl-shaped lawn would
enhance the visibility of his property and the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the orchestra's board say he burnished his
credibility by mentioning that he represented a group bidding on
the Washington Redskins football team and that he was buying casino
properties in Las Vegas. He also sponsored three philharmonic
concerts inside the country club, and these came off without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the orchestra's 20 or so board members were beguiled by
the idea of six summer concerts that would provide extra work for
musicians, create a new revenue source and cultivate larger
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped in time to see this whole project turn into another
Wolf Trap or Tanglewood,'' said Joseph Tockarshewsky, who at the
time was president of the orchestra's board and chief executive of
Poughkeepsie Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Others were skeptical, particularly since there was talk that
Zarro had left a trail of sour financial deals. The doubting
Thomases like Frank Meyer, former managing editor of Variety, and
Richard Sampson, a Bell Atlantic executive, were reassured,
however, by executives of the orchestra board who said that Zarro
would provide the production money up front.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, bothered to check Zarro's background. Zarro,
who lives in Stanfordville, N.Y., has said that he filed for
personal bankruptcy in 1994. After the summer disaster, The
Poughkeepsie Journal published a list of 11 lawsuits, tax liens and
default judgments against Zarro and his enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Zarro's financial history, his lawyer, David Sall,
disputed the validity of individual legal actions, then added:
``I'm not trying to paint pictures of sainthood. Frank Zarro is an
entrepreneur. He makes a fortune; he loses a fortune. Anybody who
wants to know the story of Frank Zarro can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Florida, where he was exploring
some fresh real estate deals, Zarro said his financial troubles
were widely known.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Freni, the orchestra's administrative director, said the
watershed moment came in April 1998 when Tockarshewsky signed a
contract for the summer series. She said that Tockarshewsky should
have required Zarro to agree to an explicit payment schedule that
was drawn up to ensure that the orchestra had money to pay its
vendors for portable toilets, generators, playbills and
advertising. Zarro, she said, had apparently balked, citing
uncertainty about his cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You supposedly have professional men, including a bank
president, who should have said, `No, let's not do it,' '' said Ms.
Freni, who lost her job in November.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Tockarshewsky said he had believed that the box
office income would be sufficient to cover the bills even if Zarro
stalled on paying them. Associates of Tockarshewsky added that he
also believed the overall contract obligated Zarro to meet the
payment schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Had the July 4 concert been a success, events might have turned
out differently.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ray Charles, the headliner for the final concert, could not
turn things around. As the shortfall deepened, Zarro repeatedly
promised to repay money, but he never fully came through, board
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Zarro contends he lost $750,000, accuses the orchestra's
management of overspending and building a shoddy stage, and blames
it for giving away tickets. When the Hudson Valley Philharmonic
sued him to recover its losses, he countered with his own lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told people I had the money up front to pay for
this,'' he said. ``In fact, when they asked for a schedule of
payments, I refused to do so, and they signed it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he hopes to repay the orchestra and vendors
someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did wrong was I shot too high, I aspired for too
much,'' he said. ``Not only did I dream, but they did too.''
</P>
<P>
   To almost everyone else, however, Zarro deserves most of the
blame.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who succeeded Tockarshewsky as president of the
orchestra's board, said ``You're at a disadvantage when you believe
people will do what they say they're going to do.''

MOVIE STUDIOS LEARN TO LIVE WITH LESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (for release Sunday, June 13) 
(rk) 
 By   BERNARD WEINRAUB and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Ten years ago, the stars, and their agents, ruled
Hollywood. Duds like ``Legal Eagles'' and ``Family Business'' were
packaged by talent agents for clients like Robert Redford, Dustin
Hoffman and Sean Connery, and the studios, without batting an eye,
paid lavish sums to make them.
</P>
<P>
   But now the studios are regaining the upper hand, and their main
weapon is supply and demand. Under strict orders from their
corporate owners to pay more heed to the bottom line, studios are
making fewer films, forcing the people who work in the industry to
carve up a smaller pie.
</P>
<P>
   Midlevel actors and directors, hungry for jobs, are quietly
willing to take pay cuts. And while top stars and directors can
still usually write their own tickets _ Steven Spielberg and Tom
Hanks earned $40 million each from the success of ``Saving Private
Ryan'' _ sometimes even the most high-profile projects are dropped
altogether if their costs seem unlikely to be recouped.
</P>
<P>
   Those who control the big studios _ many of which have been
reduced to midsized operating units of giant conglomerates _ devote
much of their creative energies to conjuring up new ways to limit
the financial risks of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   The artists may not like it, but the corporate bosses know that
is the only way to get predictable earnings in a low-margin
business, one in which the flops far outnumber the hits. And that
mind-set has stripped the movie business of some of the sex appeal
that a decade ago _ in the pre-dot-com era _ made it a mecca for
investors the world over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the return on capital in the film industry, it
has to be in the midsingle digits, which is probably no better than
a Treasury bill,'' said David J. Londoner, a media analyst for
Schroder &AMP; Co. He estimated that overall profits from the major
film studios would drop about 20 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television divisions make money, the film library makes
money, but current releases lose money,'' Londoner said. ``It's
worse than it has been for the past couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood sky, of course, is hardly falling. Producers,
executives and talent agents still earn huge sums. Christopher
McGurk, a former top executive at Universal Pictures, was recently
hired as vice chairman and chief operating officer by the
floundering Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a five-year compensation
package worth at least $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   And though Tom Cruise deferred his customary $20 million-plus
salary for a hefty percentage of Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide
Shut,'' he may easily earn double that if the film is successful.
</P>
<P>
   But revenues have simply not kept up, as the average cost of a
film doubled between 1993 and 1998, from $26.1 million to $52.7
million, and marketing costs climbed 79 percent, to $25.3 million.
Something had to give. And it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a time of creative deal-making _ and I mean that as a
euphemism,'' said Tom Strickler, a partner at the Endeavor talent
agency, which represents actors like Adam Sandler and Bette Midler.
``Artists can't be as selective as they once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some agents are being laid off. And a growing number
of producers _ as well as actors, filmmakers and technicians _ can
no longer count on being kept on a studio payroll as they scout for
projects or seek jobs in television.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the shift can be traced to changing film-industry
economics. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the home-video, cable and
pay-TV businesses exploded, creating new sources of revenue for the
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Box-office receipts, which generated 35 percent of film revenues
in 1990, dwindled to 24 percent last year. But in the last few
years, the growth in the home-video business has slowed, and DVDs,
which some studios are heralding as the next big source of revenue,
are still in their infancy.
</P>
<P>
   In this bottom-line atmosphere, studios negotiate with talent
agents, but their dictum is simple: Take it or leave it. This is a
striking turnabout from the 1980s and early 1990s, when Michael
Ovitz, then chairman of the Creative Artists Agency, dominated
Hollywood by packaging projects for actors and directors and
virtually telling studios the same thing studios are telling agents
now. Ovitz himself is seeking to return to Hollywood, this time as
a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delivering product to very receptive buyers,'' said
Ron Meyer, who once worked as a partner with Ovitz at Creative
Artists but now sits on the other side of table as president of
Universal Studios. ``In today's climate, with the risks so great,
it's just much easier for a studio to say no to anything they
believe is not very commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   Talent agents are adjusting. ``If a movie doesn't fit a studio's
financial model, they can do without making it,'' said David
O'Connor, a top agent at Creative Artists. He minimized the shift,
saying that the movie business was facing a ``correction.'' Studios
are reasserting financial controls, he said, but the talent _ or at
least top stars and a handful of directors _ are still the main
engine.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits. Recently, Dreamworks refused to pay Brad
Pitt, whose last few films have fallen short of their studios'
expectations, his $15 million fee for a film about the world of
rock music written and directed by Cameron Crowe, who made ``Jerry
McGuire.'' Instead, Billy Crudup, a relative unknown, will play the
role _ for less than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage dropped his fee from $20 million to $8 million to
work within the budget of Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the
Dead,'' about paramedics in Hell's Kitchen, due out in October from
Paramount. And after extensive wrangling with 20th Century Fox,
agents for Cuba Gooding Jr. have agreed to take less than his
customary $3 million for an action film, ``Navy Diver.''.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Brothers, once an extravagant spender on hits like
``Lethal Weapon'' and flops like ``The Postman,'' surprised
Hollywood last year by shelving two big-budget films: a new version
of ``Superman,'' which was to star Nicolas Cage and Kevin Spacey,
and ``I Am Legend,'' an action-adventure film with Arnold
Schwarzenegger, whose career has lagged in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been forced to see the cold realities of the
very narrow profit margins of the movie business,'' said Brian
Grazer, producer of films like ``Ransom'' and ``Apollo 13.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is the influx of conglomerates, which have moved
into the business on the theory that while film operations may not
always be great moneymakers, they enhance the value of cable
channels and TV networks, and build lucrative film libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are really trying to do is to build asset values that
help your other businesses,'' Londoner, the media analyst, said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   News Corp., run by Rupert Murdoch, started the trend in 1985 by
buying 20th Century Fox. It was followed into the industry by Sony,
which bought Columbia; Viacom, which bought Paramount, and
Matsushita, which bought Universal and then sold it to Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   In the halcyon days of growth in home video and cable, the
number of films produced rose sharply. But the corporate owners
have finally begun to apply pressure on their studios _ which,
though glamorous, are much riskier enterprises than many of the
other business lines competing with them for management attention
and capital.
</P>
<P>
   Films and television accounted for 68 percent of Paramount
Communications' 1988 revenues; last year, they represented 39
percent of Viacom's sales. At Time Warner, they are around 30
percent of sales, down from 37 percent a decade earlier at Warner
Communications, before the merger with Time Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At Disney, it is almost impossible to figure out how the film
and TV business is doing, because its results are lumped in with
the ABC television network and other operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These used to be stand-alone entities, and as such they were
the total focus of the management,'' said Herbert Allen, who heads
Allen &AMP; Co., an investment banking firm in New York that
specializes in media deals. ``Now they are divisions of larger
companies, representing dramatically less of a percentage of sales
and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, corporate chiefs are applying heavy pressure on
division heads to control spending so that even a bad run of films
will not crush earnings. ``The Eisners, Murdochs and Redstones have
all woken up and said, `This can't go on,''' said Joe Roth,
chairman of Walt Disney Studios, referring to the chief executives
of Disney, the News Corp. and Viacom, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   So Brian Mulligan, executive vice president at Seagram's
Universal, likes to talk about managing a ``portfolio of films''
assembled to reduce risk, while Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin
is quick to point out that Warner's film and television business is
only 11 percent of cash flow. (That helps to explain why Time
Warner stock climbed even while Warner Brothers studios endured
several flops in recent years like ``The Avengers,'' ``Quest for
Camelot'' and ``Father's Day.'')
</P>
<P>
   At Fox Filmed Entertainment, chairman Bill Mechanic and his
associates recently spent more than a year scaling back the budget
of the Sean Connery romantic adventure ``Entrapment.'' The film was
initially budgeted at $140 million, but the price tag was slashed
to $60 million, Mechanic said.
</P>
<P>
   The studio hired a new director willing to work within its
budget, dropped numerous costly action sequences and revised the
script to focus more on character. The film, which was released in
late April, has grossed $75 million and, with foreign ticket sales,
will probably turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Similar re-evaluations across Hollywood are having a striking
impact. For the most part, studios make either large-scale films
like ``The Mummy,'' ``The Matrix,'' or ``Armageddon,'' with appeal
to a wide, international audience, or smaller films aimed at
specific moviegoers, like teen-agers, women or African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are either more global in their appeal, or they're more
focused and targeted to specific audiences,'' said Casey Silver, a
producer and a former chairman at Universal Studios, who gave the
go-ahead to ``The Mummy'' and acquired ``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Grown-up films _ movies more serious or sophisticated than, say,
the new hit ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' released
this weekend _ are increasingly left to independents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the leading ``independents,'' like Disney's
Miramax, Time Warner's Fine Line and Fox Searchlight, are not
independent at all but are owned by the same companies that control
studios. But the financial contrasts nonetheless are startling, as
these production outfits operate with lower overhead, and actors
expect lower fees when they make independent films.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fox Searchlight's ``The Full Monty,'' which cost $3.5 million
and grossed $250 million around the world, is one of the most
profitable films of the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``The Horse Whisperer'' and ``Six Days, Seven Nights,''
by contrast, grossed $190 million and $175 million, respectively,
but did not make a dime for the studio. The reason? Huge budgets
and marketing costs, and hefty salaries for the likes of Robert
Redford, Harrison Ford and the director Ivan Reitman.
</P>
<P>
   Roth made it clear that as a studio chief, he has limited
options. Fewer and fewer studios are making serious films _ those
designed for a relatively small audience ``that's older, requires
the most in terms of production value and wants to have movie
stars,'' he said. ``So if we make a high-end drama intended for
adults over 40, then you're dealing with an audience that shows up
only sporadically and that requires great reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I have it executed one degree short of perfection, I
may lose it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, he said, younger audiences do not require expensive
stars, often return to the same film two or three _ or even more _
times and are unaffected by critics. For studios like Disney, the
choice is clear.
</P>
<P>
   The mantra for many, but not all, studio executives in Hollywood
is now ``sharing the risk,'' or laying off part of a film's cost by
seeking a financial partner or pre-selling the foreign rights to
other distributors. The most notable example is ``Titanic,'' which
grossed $1.8 billion around the world but was notoriously over
budget before its Christmas 1997 release.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, which had the film rights, put up $135 million of the $200
million cost and distributed the film overseas. Paramount paid the
rest and released the film in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   After the costs were recouped, Fox has received 60 percent of
the revenues while the remainder has gone to Paramount. However
lucrative the film, though, the partnership was so tense that there
was a near-fistfight between two top studio executives over the
movie's release date.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of top executives and producers are ambivalent, at
best, about sharing costs. Those who make such deals, said John
Calley, chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, are letting their
anxiety about their own decisions stop them from capitalizing on
their successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you're betting the downside, you're not supporting
your creative choices,'' Calley said. Sony, which buys rights but
does not sell them, is now sharing the costs of two films with
Universal and one with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   A different corporate approach is typified by Jonathan Dolgen,
chairman of the Viacom Entertainment Group, Paramount's parent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Paramount owns most of its films outright, he said, the
studio strongly believes in spreading risks by splitting costs,
whether by taking on equity investors, acquiring limited rights to
movies or making other arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It substantially modifies the thing that people on the Street
most hate about the movie business, which is the wild swings,''
Dolgen said. ``If you have a movie that cost $100 million, you can
wake up on the first Saturday morning after it opens and realize
you've lost $50 million. There are a limited number of those
Saturday mornings that you actually want to entertain that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, there are some possible new revenues that may
ease the stinginess, with studio chiefs saying the advent of
higher-quality digital video disks, or DVDs, will prompt moviegoers
to rebuild their film libraries. Robert A. Daly, co-chairman of
Warner Brothers, is especially hopeful. ``DVD, pay per view, video
on demand _ these are the critical areas of the movie business over
the next few years,'' he said. ``And the good part about DVD is
it's going to bring in revenues in the area that doesn't push up
costs: the library.''
</P>
<P>
   But optimism is in somewhat short supply in Hollywood. Studio
executives have even noticed that the glitter of Internet riches is
shining brighter among ambitious college graduates than the glitz
of movieland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an explosion of industries with a visual
orientation, with the computer and the Internet, and for the
moment, those are far more interesting,'' said Allen. ``If you look
at the total compensation of the people in those industries, and
the wealth generated, the Internet businesses make everyone else
look small, boring and pale in comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   But Calley, who helped run Warner Brothers studios from 1968 to
1981, takes the long view. He recalled that Warner Brothers and
Stanley Kubrick were locked in a dispute in 1970 over the costs of
``A Clockwork Orange.'' Kubrick insisted on spending $1.32 million
on the film, while Calley wanted to spend $1.28 million. A
compromise was reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but we were having budget interviews with
Variety and The Hollywood Reporter in the mid-'70s about how these
out-of-control costs were going to destroy the industry,'' he said.
``What occurs over and over again is that as costs seem to have
reached the ultimate state of `out of control,' along comes a new
income stream, a la DVD, that takes up the slack and resuscitates
you through yet another cycle.''

AS FEDERAL PROSECUTOR QUITS, ASPIRING SUCCESSORS RUSH IN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Calif.)   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among those seeking to become the U.S. attorney for
the Eastern District of New York when Zachary Carter steps down in
July is his chief assistant. But others who work or have worked in
Carter's office, and lawyers in private practice, have also
expressed interest, other lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   The chief assistant, Loretta Lynch, said this week that she was
a candidate for the job of top federal prosecutor for Brooklyn,
Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. The post involves heading
one of the busiest federal prosecution offices in the nation, with
a regular stream of high-profile cases, like the one that climaxed
this week: the prosecution of New York City police officers accused
of brutalizing Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to recommend Carter's
successor to President Clinton. But a person close to the senator,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, said this week that no one
has an edge at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Donoghue, a Manhattan-based lawyer who is the chairman of
the senator's screening committee for federal judgeships and U.S.
attorney posts, declined Friday to say how many candidates there
were for the job, which pays $118,000 a year. He would not reveal
any of the candidates' names.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who has held the job for six years, announced several
weeks ago that he would be leaving to join the New York office of
Dorsey &AMP; Whitney, a Minneapolis-based law firm. Those who are
interested in applying for the job have until Tuesday to submit
their names.
</P>
<P>
   Once a candidate is nominated by President Clinton, the
appointment will be subject to confirmation by the
Republican-controlled Senate. If the entire process is not
completed by the time Carter leaves office, Attorney General Janet
Reno will appoint an interim replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials declined to speculate Friday on Ms.
Reno's likely choice. Schumer has directed his screening committee
``to move as expeditiously as possible,'' said a spokeswoman,
Cathie Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said: ``It is the senator's choice, and I respect his
prerogative. I do believe Loretta Lynch, who is my chief assistant,
is extremely well qualified for the position of U.S. attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lynch has been with the office for nine years and has been
No. 2 to Carter for the last 15 months. She was a member of the
prosecution team in the racially charged Louima trial, in which one
officer pleaded guilty in May to torturing Louima, a Haitian
immigrant, in a Brooklyn police station in 1997 and a second
officer was convicted on Tuesday of helping in the crime. Three
other officers were acquitted of other charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers who practice in the federal courts in New York said
Ms. Lynch's competition could include current and former
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have indicated interest in the job, they said,
are Alan Vinegrad, a member of the Louima trial team, and two
former top aides to Carter, Barbara D. Underwood and Valerie
Caproni.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegrad, who is chief of the criminal division in Carter's
office and has worked in the office eight years, declined Friday to
comment. He was a member of the prosecution team in another
racially charged Brooklyn case, in which two black men were
convicted in 1997 in the fatal stabbing of a Hasidic Jew in Crown
Heights in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caproni, who headed the criminal division until she left
last September to become regional director of the Pacific Regional
office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Friday from
her office in Los Angeles: ``I'm incredibly flattered that my name
is coming up, and I think that being U.S. attorney for the Eastern
District is one of the best jobs in the country. I was in the
office for a long time, and I feel close to it.'' She was the
second half of the team in the Crown Heights trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Underwood, who preceded Ms. Lynch as Carter's chief
assistant, left that post early last year to become principal
deputy solicitor general of the United States. Reached at her
office in Washington on Thursday, she declined to comment. Two
people who know her said they believed she had decided not to seek
to succeed Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Kamins, a lawyer in private practice, said he had
submitted his name after people ``who were in touch'' with the
screening committee suggested that he do so. He is a former
president of the Brooklyn Bar Association. Roger Adler, a lawyer
who is chairman of the bar association's federal courts committee,
said he was considering putting his hat in the ring.

OFFICIALS WARN AGAINST HARVESTING SHELLFISH ON SEATTLE'S URBAN
BEACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ How much urban shellfish should a shucker shun if a
shucker should shun urban shellfish?
</P>
<P>
   All of them, say public health officials. Given that this
weekend is the beginning of the lowest tide of the year, they are
warning against harvesting shellfish on any urban beach because of
an ever-present pollution risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real potential that people will be exposing
themselves to chronic contaminants,'' said Wayne Clifford, manager
of shellfish safety for the Washington state Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   In King County, for example, most of the urban beaches are
considered unsafe for recreational shellfish consumption because of
sewage run-off and a toxic smorgasbord of chemical pollutants used
by homeowners and industry that sometimes ends up in Puget Sound
through storm drains.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking, which can eliminate most natural hazards, has no effect
on many chemical contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area is so urbanized and there are so many potential
sources of contamination we feel people need to go to beaches away
from populated areas,'' said Larry Kirchner, acting director of
environmental health for the public health department of Seattle
and King County.
</P>
<P>
   The only beaches in King County considered safe for recreational
shellfish harvesting are some of the beaches on Vashon Island,
Kirchner said. This appears to be because those areas have better
water flow and lower population density, he said.
</P>
<P>
   King County may have the highest number of contaminated beaches,
but it doesn't have all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just a problem for Seattle,'' emphasized Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   Many beaches in Pierce and Kitsap counties are equally risky
because of sewage runoff and chemical pollutants, he said. Even
some rural beaches that may look all right may not be because of
local industry effluent or a sewage treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   The risk posed by the naturally occurring organisms such as
``red tide'' _ technically, paralytic shellfish poisoning _ is a
separate concern that public health officials are often able to
monitor and warn against.
</P>
<P>
   The health risk from pollutants such as toxic heavy metals or
pesticides is too difficult to adequately monitor, Clifford said,
so consumers need to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Kirchner noted that there is already ample evidence of the
accumulation of toxic chemicals in sediments throughout Puget Sound
_ enough to suggest that frequent consumption of shellfish from
urban beaches could raise a person's risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination comes from sewage treatment plant runoffs and
stormwater outfalls that contaminate the water with bacterial and
viral toxins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shellfish that are commercially raised and harvested are
safe,'' said Dr. Alonzo Plough, director of public health for
Seattle and King County.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial shellfish beds are more carefully monitored and
tested for contaminants than are recreational harvest areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real well-equipped to monitor Puget Sound for bacteria
and bio-toxins,'' said Clifford.
</P>
<P>
   He said the state has about 1,000 water quality instruments,
many of them near commercial shellfish beds, that keep a constant
watch out for bacterial contaminants such as red tide or E. coli.
</P>
<P>
   But the monitoring program is not able to detect all potential
hazards, Clifford said, and cannot ever offer a complete guarantee
against the risk from shellfish consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 Institute of Medicine report on ``Seafood Safety''
chaired by a former University of Washington professor of marine
food science, Dr. John Liston, found that ``chronic illness
resulting from seafood consumption is associated primarily with
environmental contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   A large proportion of the shellfish eaten in the United States
comes from recreational harvest, Liston's committee found, and very
little of it is adequately analyzed for potential health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water in Puget Sound is cleaner than it used to be,'' said
Liston, who is now retired from the UW. ``But some of the areas
subject to domestic pollution can contain all kinds of chemicals.
... There's so many of them and they're now used so liberally.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms associated with eating contaminated shellfish include
mild to severe stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea or fever. Symptoms
of infection from red tide begin with a numbness or tingling in the
lips that can progress to serious respiratory paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesser-known, naturally occurring hazard is vibrio, a
bacterium found more frequently in shellfish as the water
temperature increases.

TROOP MOVEMENTS RAISE CONCERNS OVER RUSSIA'S INTENTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to recast as news analysis with updated information.)  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The arrival of Russian troops in Pristina, the capital
of Kosovo, before dawn Saturday raises disturbing questions about
the Kremlin's control of the military.
</P>
<P>
   After Russian troops moved into Yugoslavia on Friday, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov assured the Clinton administration
that the force would not enter Kosovo until Russia had reached an
understanding with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours later, however, Ivanov was reading a dawn statement
on Cable News Network, declaring that the Kosovo deployment was a
colossal mistake and announcing that the Russian troops would
immediately be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, Russian troops have been
bedraggled and dispirited but obedient. They have done what the
Kremlin has told them, despite their poor pay, declining status in
Russian society and resentment of NATO's expansion into central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But following NATO's air raids on Yugoslavia, senior Russian
military officials increasingly seem to have had their own foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Alarm was generated Friday when a senior Russian defense
ministry official, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, publicly warned that
Moscow might unilaterally send troops to Kosovo if NATO did not
drop its insistence that it command all of the peacekeeping forces
there.
</P>
<P>
   The same general raised eyebrows earlier this month when he
denounced as a sellout the settlement supported by Russian envoy
Victor Chernomydrin.
</P>
<P>
   With Moscow a battleground of intrigue, there were several
possibilities to explain what happened Saturday morning, none of
them particularly reassuring. Top Russian military officials may
have simply ignored their civilian counterparts and urged the
troops on in a mad rush to beat NATO's force to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Russian military's system of command and control may be
so frayed that Moscow found it impossible to stop the forces before
they entered Kosovo after the initial deployment orders had been
given.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing questions concerned the role of Boris Yeltsin,
Russia's president and the ultimate commander of the military.
Would he back Ivanov and hold Russian military leaders to account?
Or has his authority dissipated to the point where the military is
free to challenge the civilian leaders?
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly, Yeltsin's top spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, was
initially unaware that Russian troops had left Bosnia for
Yugoslavia when he was asked about it earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The system of controls on Russia's nuclear forces is generally
considered to be strict. But the developments of Friday and
Saturday were bound to generate searching questions about the
checks on the military in that area, too.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's mini-crisis began without warning when about 175
Russian soldiers suddenly left their peacekeeping posts in Bosnia
and drove into Yugoslavia. The troops had painted ``KFOR'' on their
vehicles, the name of the peacekeeping force designated for Kosovo,
indicating they intended to take up positions there. The movement
of the Russian forces prompted fears among NATO leaders that the
Kremlin was preparing to seize its own peacekeeping sector in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Ivanov assured Washington _ wrongly, as it turned out
_ that the troops would not enter Kosovo, U.S. concern about a
potential political, and perhaps even military, confrontation with
the Russians was so great that U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott, en route to Brussels, Belgium, by plane, was
instructed to turn around in mid-flight and rush back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The column from Bosnia was not the only worry NATO had. Another
1,000 paratroopers were on alert, waiting to be flown to
Yugoslavia, the Russian defense ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said Washington anticipated additional troops
would be sent to Yugoslavia because Hungary had granted a Russian
request for overflight rights for its troop transport planes. The
official added that the United States had received conflicting
reports that a Russian IL-76 troop transport plane might have
already landed in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was the abruptness of the Russian troop movements and the
fact that the troops made their move after a deadlock about the
role of Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo that alarmed NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The allies had insisted that all of the peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo must be under a unified command led by a NATO general.
Russia, however, has adamantly refused to put its troops under NATO
control and has insisted that it be given a sector of its own to
control.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO insists that the Russians have never been under any
illusion about its demand, the issue was dealt with indirectly in
the resolution the U.N. Security Council adopted early this week.
An annex to the resolution refers to the need for ``unified command
and control'' but does not say explicitly that NATO must lead the
force.
</P>
<P>
   After generals from U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Russian
defense ministry failed to agree in talks here Friday on a solution
on the question of command, the chief Russian negotiator issued a
blunt warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this agreement is not reached Russia has the same right as
NATO,'' Ivashov said. ``We shall announce a sector that will be
agreed with the Yugoslav side and which will meet our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with reports of Russian troop movements, that statement
set off alarm bells at NATO's military headquarters in Belgium and
at the Skopje, Macedonia, headquarters for the allied peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military leaders were worried that the Russians might
simply drive into Kosovo, claim a sector in the northern and
heavily Serb part of the province and, in the words of one ranking
allied official, ``create facts on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is vehemently opposed to the establishment of a
Russian sector, fearing that ethnic Albanians would be afraid to
return there. This could create a de facto partition of Kosovo with
ethnic Albanians in some areas and Serbs in others, an arrangement
NATO has said it would never allow.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that NATO might have won its war with Yugoslavia only to
lose control of the peace, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who was visiting Macedonia, made an urgent phone call to her
counterpart, Ivanov, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially repudiating Gen. Ivashov, the Russian foreign
minister assured Albright that Russian troops would not enter
Kosovo without an understanding with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, Ivanov added, was simply doing what NATO has been doing
for months: assembling peacekeeping forces outside Kosovo in
anticipation that they will soon be deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreign minister said he understands that there was to be
a unified command,'' Albright said. ``He also said this was a
preliminary step so that if and when they become part of the
international security presence today, they will be in a position
to deploy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ivanov's twin assurances to, first, prevent the
deployment and, now, reverse it, Russia remains deeply unhappy over
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the way the alliance is managing
the peace. The Russian foreign minister said on Friday that Moscow
would never agree to a command arrangement in which its troops are
``subordinated'' to NATO officers.
</P>
<P>
   One fear, a Russian official said Friday night, is that NATO
peacekeepers would enter Kosovo and spread out through the
province. By the time a solution for the command problem might be
found, the Russia peacekeepers would be superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are concerns that if NATO enters Kosovo first there
might be no place left for other forces,'' the Russian official
said. ``We will be begging for some place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not the first time that the Russian military appeared
to have chartered its own foreign policy on Kosovo. After
Chernomyrdin, the Russian special envoy, returned from his mission
to Belgrade with the Finnish president, Gen. Ivanshov assailed the
accord as a sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin later intervened to support a settlement. Ivashov,
however, not only kept his position; he led the Russian delegation
in the talks Friday on command arrangements for peacekeepers in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politics aside, the latest developments undercut efforts
to rebuild trust between the two sides following NATO's 78-day
bombing campaign, the most divisive event in Russia's relations
with the West since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong student of Russian politics, Talbott, the deputy
secretary of state, was one of the architects of the strategy to
include Moscow in a Balkan settlement and restore U.S.-Russian
relations. But Friday night, even Talbott's erudition was
challenged by the bewildering intrigue and pandemonium of Russian
politics.

VALENTINE SUSPENDED AND FINED BY LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mets manager Bobby Valentine was suspended for two
games and fined $5,000 by the National League on Friday for
violating a league rule by not staying in the clubhouse after he
was ejected from the game Wednesday night. Valentine appealed the
suspension and may keep managing until his case is heard by NL
president Leonard Coleman early next week.
</P>
<P>
   After Valentine said he would not comment on the suspension or
the appeal, he proceeded vehemently to defend his actions to
reporters by saying he never returned to the dugout and was in the
stairwell leading to the dugout for only a matter of seconds. Like
a detective retracing a crime scene, Valentine even ushered two
dozen reporters from behind the batting cage to the position in the
first base dugout at Shea Stadium where he said he had stood.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's histrionics will probably wind up being irrelevant,
because Rule 5.1 states that any manager, coach, player or trainer
who is ejected must leave the field instantly and remain in the
clubhouse until the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   While ejected managers have often hidden in the dugout runways
during games and umpires have looked the other way, Valentine crept
too far and was visible to television cameras while using eyeblack
stickers for a fake mustache, borrowed black sunglasses and a black
baseball cap. Valentine said he was unaware that Rule 5.1 confined
him to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to talk about it,'' Valentine said. ``That's what an
appeal is. I want to make sure no one thought I was in the dugout.
I was in the clubhouse most of the time and then I came out and
made a couple of jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   The league did not laugh and acted swiftly to suspend Valentine
because it felt that his actions flirted with the integrity of the
game. If the Mets made a pitching change, used a pinch-hitter or
had a successful hit and run after Valentine was ejected in the
12th inning of the 14-inning game against Toronto, the Blue Jays
could have protested their 4-3 defeat and argued that Valentine had
orchestrated those moves. But Valentine scoffed at this notion and
claimed he never witnessed one pitch from his perch beside the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally out of players, except for one pitcher,''
Valentine said. ``There was not one move to make on my bench or in
my bullpen and I definitely wasn't sitting on the bench. Go
figure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is quite rare for a manager to be suspended, unless he is
connected with a brawl or has an altercation with an umpire.
Valentine was suspended for three games while with Texas in 1986
after an incident with an umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he wore the disguise as a way of loosening up his
team, and he felt it worked because virtually everyone who saw him
grinned and all of the Mets' pitchers donned fake mustaches before
batting practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret it,'' he said. ``It's going to cost me a lot of
money. I don't regret the fact that it lightened the team.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips declined to comment on
Valentine's behavior, other than to say that the organization would
not fine or punish him and that Phillips was upset that the Mets
might lose their manager for two games. Phillips repeated a
question and said: ``Did I laugh? No comment on that.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked Valentine to demonstrate where he had been on
Wednesday, he took the bait and invited a gaggle of reporters to
follow him. There are six steps leading from the dugout to the
runway, and Valentine asserted that he had stood there and moved
back and forth but never stepped on the top step, and so he had
never been in the dugout. While there is a picture of Valentine
seemingly sitting in the dugout, there is a duffel bag resting on a
ledge behind him in the photograph. There are no ledges behind the
seats in the dugout, but there is a ledge adjacent to the
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pictures, it looks like I was in the dugout,
doesn't it?'' Valentine said. ``Have you guys seen that? Who else
thought I was in the dugout?''
</P>
<P>
   After several reporters nodded or raised their hands, Valentine
smiled and said, ``You're all wrong.'' &QL;

NATURAL WONDER ON PUGET SOUND WILL HAVE HIGH AND LOW POINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ In the south Puget Sound basin near Olympia,
they're talking about ``the bathtub slosh effect.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the name for the dramatic rise and fall of Puget Sound to
come just before noon Monday, when forces of nature will bring the
lowest and highest tides of 1999 _ minus 3.5 feet, followed by a
corresponding high tide of plus 12.5 feet about seven hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The swing of the salt water will mean a 16-foot rise and fall,
about twice the annual average.
</P>
<P>
   In Olympia, at the closed end of the Sound, the swing of the
tide is still more pronounced _ a 22-foot difference as the water
retreats and then sloshes back.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's extreme tides won't be a record _ that would be the
minus 4.5 feet that comes every 19 years and is due again in about
2007 _ but the natural wonder is notable enough to excite local
maritime folks and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a horrid time, however, to be a sea urchin, tidelands
snail, sponge, starfish or kelp. Caught in the struggle between sea
and land, these delicate forms of sealife are exposed to prolonged
predations from people and nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have nightmares, this would be one of the worst,''
says Megan Dephier, a University of Washington intertidal
specialist in Friday Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very stressful,'' Dephier says. ``With the air and sun,
there may be dying plants and animals, algae bleaches white, snails
close up tight. Dessication occurs, and people pull or rip them
from their homes'' even by doing something as innocent as turning
over a rock.
</P>
<P>
   The bulging tides that swing into the Sound from the Pacific
Ocean also carry more powerful current, especially at places like
the Tacoma Narrows where water bottlenecks between islands and land
masses. At Deception Pass on Whidbey Island, north of Seattle, the
current could reach 8.1 knots per hour, or about 13 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners will keep their eyes peeled as channels narrow. Pilots
who board the big freighters, grain ships and tankers that commonly
draw 55 feet pay attention in places like Guemes Channel near
Anacortes, the Duwamish Waterway in Elliott Bay and Hylebos
Waterway in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Bill Bock of the Puget Sound Pilots group said some
sailings may have to be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions may prove a challenge for boaters, but the extreme
tides are opportunities for researchers, foragers, divers,
sightseers _ even Druids preparing to celebrate the summer solstice
a week hence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very aware of the tides,'' says Leon Reed of Seattle,
pursewarden for the 180-member Bards of Caer Pugetia and
representative to the British Druid Order. Ancient teachings for
Druids, who celebrate cycles of the sun and moon and revere
connections between earth, sea and sky, call for them ``to learn
thre new things each day: The phase of the moon; the day of the
week; and the state of the tide, without error,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   When the moon and the sun line up, combining their gravitational
pull, as they will next week, the resulting spring tides are always
more extreme than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The interconnection between the heavens and the earth that bring
about the seasonal effects aren't lost on modern scientists, who
consider it prime time to study intertidal life.
</P>
<P>
   UW's Dephier, for example, will board a helicopter with state
biologists to inventory kelp, sea grass, barnacles and mussel beds
while describing the consistency of sandy or gravelly soils and the
broadness of beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Divers will be out to enjoy the high tides around Alki Beach and
at Edmonds, where they have to be careful because the currents can
push them far from their boats, said Mary Jachetta of Sailfin
Diving Adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Brace yourself now. Here comes a little bit of science.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mumford, head of the state Department of Natural Resources
aquatic resources section, said Pacific Coast tides have more
dramatic ranges than Atlantic Ocean tides.
</P>
<P>
   He called the West Coast tides, and Washington tides in
particular, ``fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called mixed semi-diurnal,'' Mumford explained.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two high and two low tides in a 24-hour period, there's a
high-high tide and a low-high tide, with corresponding high-low
tides and low-low tides.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have two low tides and two
high tides a day, but tide patterns are affected by the coastline
and the depth of the water. Atlantic Coast tides, for example, are
far more regular, Mumford said. In contrast, the Pacific Coast has
a high-high tide, a low-high tide, a low-low tide and a high-low
tide, due in part to the shape of each basin.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas of Washington, it might seem as though Atlantis
has risen, as the state's 3,438 miles of coastline grows
exponentially, he added.
</P>
<P>
   No one can say precisely how much coastline will surface, but
Shallow Willapa Bay will drain dramatically during low tide. West
of Port Angeles, long rocky reefs will become visible off Tongue
Point from tiny Salt Creek County Park. At Seattle's Alki Point,
the ruins of Luna Park, a turn-of-the-century amusement park, will
emerge, along with a field of sea grass, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, wrecks might become visible. Out on Cape Alava,
the westernmost point of the Continental United States and site of
the ancient Makah Indian whaling village of Ozette, fantastic rocks
and reefs will be exposed, including areas where tribal whale
hunters moved rocks to create a pre-historic boat ramp of sorts,
said UW oceanographer Richard Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland especially likes the sound of the bathtub sloshing
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those `Hail Mary' things you try to explain,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And then he tried:
</P>
<P>
   Wave motions flow down-Sound to the Olympia area, where they hit
a land wall, move up and turn the other way. The slow rhythms take
over, just as stirring a hand in a bathtub at a slow rhythm creates
more oscillation than rapid splashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just does what every kid figures out in the bathtub _ it's
not force, it's rhythm,'' Strickland said.
</P>
<P>
   Some spots are better than others to see the low tide. Rosario
Beach near Deception Pass is one. But the increasing numbers of
tourists need to remember beach etiquette lest they destroy fragile
life-forms, researchers warn.
</P>
<P>
   There's also concern that seaweed harvesting in some areas could
do lasting damage if kelp afficonados get carried away. In some
places, signs have been posted in several languages to caution
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take too much seaweed off the beach, it's sort of like
clear-cutting the forest,'' Dephier said. ``All that shade and food
provides the structure for the shoreline community. Some might grow
back, some won't grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Even walking on a beach can be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland and Charles Simenstad, a UW fisheries biologist, said
anemones and seaweeds are hardy enough to withstand crashing water
but are soft enough to be crushed under a heel. Sponges and fish
eggs can be destroyed when rocks are turned over. Starfish often
cling to overhangs because they can't stand sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Like most critters living in the no-man's land that day,
``they're not very happy,'' Strickland said.

JACKSON TO MEET WITH LAKERS NEXT WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Bill Bradley's campaign for the White House
will bring Phil Jackson to Los Angeles next week. A campaign for
another NBA championship might get Jackson to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson arrives Wednesday in his role as confidant to Bradley,
his former New York Knicks teammate and presidential hopeful. But
Jackson's own agenda includes stumping at the Forum, where he will
meet with Los Angeles Lakers brass amid reports he will sign a
four-year deal to coach the team.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chicago Bulls coach, owner of six championship rings,
has been negotiating with the Lakers through his agent, Todd
Musberger, but has not spoken directly with executive vice
president Jerry West. That will change in the next few days as the
Lakers try to consummate a deal with Michael Jordan's former
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Sources within and outside the organization confirmed Jackson
has been offered the job, for about $6 million per year. But
sources contradicted reports that a deal had already been reached.
Jackson, meanwhile, reportedly is vacationing in Alaska and has not
been in contact with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked to him, we've had some negotiations with him,
but I have not talked to Phil personally,'' West said Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   West would not confirm a contract had been offered, saying only
``we've discussed parameters'' of a deal. ``We're certainly not at
the finish line, that's for sure...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to explore possibilities,'' West said. ``That
doesn't mean they're all with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility is retaining Kurt Rambis, previously the
favorite for the job, who remains on stand-by in case the deal with
Jackson fails to materialize. If Jackson is hired, Rambis has been
guaranteed a job within the organization, probably as an assistant
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis said he's still hopeful of winning the job, but he's not
surprised the Lakers, who up until a week ago were leaning toward
re-hiring him, changed direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, since it didn't happen immediately after the season
(ended), I knew they were going to be open to other
considerations,'' Rambis said Friday from Chicago, where he was
attending the NBA pre-draft camp. ``I'm basically just waiting to
hear what happens. I'm in a situation where I'm still in
consideration and I've also been given assurances from Jerry West
that if Phil Jackson is hired as coach, I will be retained with the
Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Rambis said, he ``absolutely'' would be comfortable working
under Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil is a highly respected coach, and I respect him,'' he
said. ``The Lakers are going to go out and get the best guy they
can for the job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current market of unemployed coaches, the undisputed
``best guy'' is Jackson, who among whose six championships are
second only to the nine won by former Boston Celtics coach Red
Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson took the past season off after winning his sixth title
in eight years with the Bulls and has spent much of his free time
working for Bradley. The Bradley campaign is scheduled to go
through L.A. Sunday, then return Wednesday through Friday with
Jackson in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers players steered clear of the issue Friday, but there is
clear support for Jackson in the locker room, where some players
lost confidence in Rambis amid the Lakers' playoff collapse against
the San Antonio Spurs. Shaquille O'Neal, who advocated that Rambis
replace the fired Del Harris in February, declined to support
Rambis in May.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is why the Lakers waited until a week and a half
ago to enter discussions with Jackson. He has been courted heavily
by the New Jersey Nets and New York Knicks, but the Lakers had
given every indication that Rambis would be retained and given a
two-year deal. Those close to the situation simply opined that
owner Jerry Buss was taking his time and decided to explore
Jackson's interest.
</P>
<P>
   That has never been much of a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jackson openly mused about the possibility of
coaching the Lakers _ ``If someone like the Lakers comes after me
and wants me to coach a team that's ready to pursue a championship
... what can I do?'' he wrote in ESPN Magazine. And he enthused
about the possibility of incorporating O'Neal into the ``triangle''
offense he made popular in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal value is Jackson's acumen for handling an array of egos
and personalities. Such skills are sorely needed in a locker room
where O'Neal and Kobe Bryant have feuded and Glen Rice has moped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always try to look for things we think will be positive.
You can't deny he's had enormous success with great players,'' West
said. ``His teams seem to have a resolve about them, he seems to
have wonderful interaction with his players, and that's
important.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Jackson does not become the Lakers' 15th coach, expect
them to stick with No. 14. The 41-year-old Rambis remains a
sentimental favorite and stands to be rewarded for his loyalty to
the Lakers after a combined 13 seasons as player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us are comfortable with Kurt Rambis here,''
West said, ``and we value him. We really do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, West remains coy about his own future. He has
contemplated retirement but said he hopes to fulfill a four-year
contract extension that begins in September. He has ``had some
great discussions'' with Buss, though, and implied he's staying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still working,'' West said.

   The NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) -- led by six American Apache
attack helicopters -- went ahead despite Russian troops' surprising
arrival in the provincial capital Pristina hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   To a celebratory crowd of thousands of jubilant ethnic Serbs,
troop transports and tanks carrying hundreds of Russian troops from
SFOR in Bosnia paraded through downtown Pristina, reassuring the
war-ravaged province's ethnic Serb population that they would be
secure during the NATO peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Russian Prime Minister Igor Ivanov gave
assurances to the Clinton White House that the convoy of some 50
vehicles, which left their peacekeeping mission in Bosnia
unexpectedly to head into Yugoslavia -- but not yet into Kosovo --
would not enter the southern Serb province before NATO did.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on CNN about an hour after their entry, Ivanov said
the troops had arrived ``unfortunately'' and that they had been
ordered to leave Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons for this are being determined. They have been
ordered to leave Kosovo immediately and to await further orders,''
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly embarrassing on a diplomatic level, the movement
by the Russian troops -- traditional allies of the Serbs -- did not
immediately appear to force any change in NATO's schedule for
British and French troops waiting in Macedonia on Kosovo's southern
border.
</P>
<P>
   A column of 18 helicopters, including 12 troop-carrying
Chinooks, took off from this makeshift airbase near the Kosovo
border just before daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   Their first task, according to NATO commanders, will be to clear
a 20-killometer path north into war-ravaged Kosovo province of
landmines and other explosives so that the remaining peacekeepers
and humanitarian aid groups can follow.
</P>
<P>
   The plans to enter Kosovo early Saturday never seemed to be in
jeoprady, despite the earlier arrival of Russian troops in
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   German television monitored from Skopje showed thousands of
Kosovar Serbs cheering in the streets and waving the Yugoslav flag
and shouting, ``Russia! Russia!'' in anticipation of the arrival of
the Russian troops. The ethnic Serbs also burned an American flag
to show their dissatisfaction with the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians arrived shortly after midnight aboard trucks, tanks
and armored personnel carriers. As they crept through an avenue
jammed with people, the crowd whipped into a frenzy with fireworks
and shots being fired into the air, and people reaching out to
touch the hands of the Russian troops, and showering them with
flowers and chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials said they had been reassured by Russia
that its troops would not be deployed in Kosovo ahead of the
international peacekeeping force, known as KFOR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're currently trying to get clarification about the facts,''
said White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, NATO commanders gave emergency orders for 2,000
British paratroopers to prepare for an immediate airlift deep into
Kosovo to block Russian peacekeepers that were feared heading for
the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, members of the crack British First Paratroop
Regiment sat sweltering in 95-degree heat beside troop-carrying
helicopters, waiting to jump aboard with their machine guns and
anti-tank rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   This followed reports from Moscow's Interfax news agency that
1,000 Russian troops would leave Moscow Friday afternoon and fly to
cities in Kosovo, including the capital Pristina. Interfax claimed
the Russians were at a military airfield waiting for orders to take
off.
</P>
<P>
   Another report by the Yugoslav news agency Beta said a convoy of
Russian troops had crossed into Serbia from Bosnia on their way to
peacekeeping assignments in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Macedonia to visit Kosovar refugees and NATO
troops, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was surprised
when she learned from British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, commander
of KFOR, of the Russian troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   She ordered Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had
just left Moscow, to return to try and revive his talks with
Russian counterparts about the status of a force of up to 10,000
Russian troops within the 50,000-strong peacekeeping force that is
essentially run by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians oppose putting their troops under unified NATO
command, and had backed Belgrade in insisting that the peacekeepers
serve under a United Nations flag, and not simply as a NATO force.

WHITE HOUSE STUNNED BY RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Updates, additions throughout)  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House was first stunned and then
bewildered to learn Friday night that Russian troops had rolled
into Pristina, the Kosovo capital, after receiving assurances from
Moscow all day that its troops would not move in until NATO had
given them a green light.
</P>
<P>
   After initial concerns that sent administration officials into
an hourlong emergency huddle and lighted up the phone lines to
Moscow, the White House was reassured by Moscow that the advance
into Pristina in fact was a mistake and that Russia was ordering
the troops to leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
   There was no explanation Friday night on what had led to the
troop movement, but White House officials said they accepted the
word of Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov of Russia that the movement
was a mistake. It remained unclear Friday night whether the Russian
maneuver was an assertion by Russia that it intended to control a
sector of Kosovo, whether this was a rogue act by members of the
Russian military _ perhaps intent on embarrassing pro-Western
members of the leadership in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been a cowboy field commander,'' one official
said.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials said their preliminary reports
confirmed that whatever the reason, the movement was not ordered
from Moscow. Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said, ``As
Foreign Minister Ivanov said, this was an unfortunate mistake and
the troops will be withdrawn and we're pleased they've agreed to
rectify the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said, ``We have no reason to doubt their private assurances and
public comments.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration had been alarmed earlier Friday night
when officials saw reports on CNN that the Russians had rolled into
Pristina, contrary to what the Russians had been assuring NATO all
day. But they came out of the emergency meeting convinced that the
movement was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of
state, who was in Moscow, would continue the ``constructive talks''
on Russia's role in the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The president left the White House for a friend's engagement
party, and Vice President Al Gore was attending a political
function in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that the administration understood that Russia
had pledged not to deploy ground troops into Kosovo without
coordinating with the NATO-led peacekeeping force under the command
of Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, raising longer-term
political questions about Russia's role in the Kosovo peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last we heard is the Russians have agreed to go in when
General Jackson agrees to take the NATO troops in,'' Gen. Charles
Wald said Friday afternoon in a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Wald indicated that Russian troop movements were being monitored
throughout the day. Asked whether anyone at the Pentagon could say
where the Russian troops were at a given moment, he said, ``Oh, I'm
sure somebody knows where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   In a live interview that aired about two hours before news of
the Russian arrival in Pristina, Clinton had appeared confident
that the Russians would stay out of Kosovo until NATO had worked
out a command structure for the peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian movement toward Kosovo, Clinton said, was simply
``pre-positioning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians, I think, would like to play a major role but
they understand we have to have unity of command'' under Jackson,
the president said, appearing relaxed and unconcerned about any
Russian betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians drove into Kosovo and through a loophole in the
peace accord that left unresolved the command and control of
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush to complete the draft peace resolution for Kosovo,
the Russians were able to keep any mention of NATO out of the body
of the text. What was missing from the final draft was a footnote
to the earlier accord that spelled out how the security force has
``NATO at the core.'' A key sentence describing this as meaning ``a
unified NATO chain of command'' was also missing.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Russian troops outside the allies' control could
jeopardize the return of Kosovo refugees, because many Kosovo
Albanians view Russians as Slavic brethren of the Serbs who
expelled them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the small contingent of Russian troops was greeted by
cheering Serbs in Pristina, certainly one of the few places in the
world where the arrival of Russian armored vehicles would receive
such enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   While Russian nationalists and, indeed, many Russian military
officers would balk at Russian peacekeepers' serving under NATO
command, a compromise could be patterned after the mission in
next-door Bosnia, where Russians work in the U.S. sector and report
to a U.S. general who is not the NATO commander there.

ALBANY SEEKS ACCORD ON INTEGRATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Legislative leaders are nearing an agreement on
overhauling the state's special education program to discourage
schools from placing disabled students in segregated classrooms,
legislative aides from both parties said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's special education program has come under increasing
criticism in recent years for placing far too many children, a
disproportionate number of them black and Hispanic boys in New York
City, into separate classrooms, with little chance of graduating
with a regular diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have argued for years over proposals for change, but
are now facing a threat by federal officials to cut off $325
million in aid if they fail to act. Federal officials said New York
was the only state that still failed to comply with federal rules
for special education under the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, school districts receive additional
state aid for each child placed in special education, which is for
students with problems including severe physical disabilities,
learning disabilities, emotional troubles and behavioral problems.
The extra money is intended to finance additional attention to the
severely handicapped, but critics say it has led educators to find
disabilities in children who are simply troubled or underachieving.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan being considered, the state would give school
systems more money to return disabled children to regular
classrooms, where they could continue to receive extra help. The
school systems would not be required to move the children back, but
would receive more aid if they did than if they kept the children
in special education classrooms, legislative aides said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a concession to lawmakers who were worried that their
local school systems would lose money, the plan would not reduce
aid to schools that fail to steer disabled students back into
regular classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a financial incentive for schools to place disabled
children into regular classrooms,'' said a participant in the
negotiations. ``The schools have to do it in order to get the extra
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount of the incentive would vary by district,
according to the state's complicated per-pupil aid formula.
Legislative officials would provide no estimate for how much more
the state would spend on special education, saying it depended on
how aggressively local districts moved to take advantage of the new
money.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was welcomed by educators in New York City, where
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has been trying to move disabled
students back into regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Allinger, a lobbyist for the Board of Education, said he
still had to review the details, but that he was nonetheless
encouraged. ``The board would welcome any proposal that assists
schools in appropriately integrating disabled children with their
nondisabled peers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Special education is one of the most contentious issues in state
government, and participants in the talks cautioned that some
details needed to be ironed out before lawmakers could adopt the
plan. The deal also requires the approval of Gov. George Pataki,
who has not been briefed on the plan but who has been calling on
the Legislature to overhaul special education for the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal comes after officials from the U.S. Department of
Education issued an ultimatum to the state this month. The
officials ordered the state to change its policies so as to place
more disabled students in regular classrooms, or risk losing about
$325 million in federal aid a year. That is roughly 10 percent of
the total amount that the state spends annually to educate children
with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials had urged New York for years to change its
program, contending that a disabled student should be educated in
the ``least restrictive setting'' _ ideally, a regular classroom _
unless that student cannot succeed there even with additional
specialized services, like individual tutoring. But the threat that
was issued earlier this month was the first time the federal
government set a firm deadline for the state to make those changes.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Green, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, said
officials in the agency could not comment on the proposal because
they have not had an opportunity to review it. But, she added, ``We
would certainly be encouraged to see state action to change the
funding formula in compliance with federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Officials negotiating the plan said they were confident that it
would allow the state to avoid any financial penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real deadline here, and everyone here wants to get
this issue behind us,'' said one legislative aide speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``I think this will come together and
resolve that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The special education program, which includes 400,000 students
statewide, including 84,000 in New York City, is one of the fastest
growing parts of the state budget. The state is spending $1.4
billion in the current school year, up from $527 million in the
1985-86 school year, consuming roughly 12 percent of all the money
the state spends on aid to schools.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides aid to schools using a formula that covers
a broad range of disabilities, from deafness and blindness to more
ill-defined conditions like emotional disturbances and learning
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, most special education students do not have
readily defined physical disabilities like deafness or blindness.
Instead, they are classified as ``learning disabled'' or
``emotionally handicapped.'' Education experts contend that such
labels are often loosely applied, particularly in cases in which
teachers want to rid themselves of disruptive students.
</P>
<P>
   But changing the program has been politically thorny, with
lawmakers under pressure from parents' groups and school
administrators fearful that changes would deprive disabled children
of needed services. They were particularly concerned that the state
would attempt to wring savings from the program by putting disabled
students back into regular classroom settings without providing the
services those students needed.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposal addresses those concerns by leaving the current
financing formula intact, while providing more money to give school
districts an incentive to provide services to disabled students
within regular classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the current system, a school district would lose the
additional money it receives for a disabled child once that child
was moved back to a regular class, even if he required additional
help.

REPORT IS SAID TO CLEAR SAFIR OF VIOLATIONS IN OSCARS TRIP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City lawyers have concluded that the New York Police
Commissioner, Howard Safir, showed poor judgment but violated no
ethics rules or laws by accepting a free junket to the Academy
Awards from a corporate executive for Revlon, according to
officials familiar with a draft of a report on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   A final version of the report by Corporation Counsel Michael
Hess has not been released or presented to Safir, who requested the
review after questions arose about his excursion to the awards
ceremony in March, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the broad outlines of Hess' preliminary findings are
contained in a draft report, the details of which were reported
Friday in The Daily News. While the draft report clears Safir of
any ethical violation, it recommends that he avoid any appearance
of impropriety by reimbursing the Revlon executive, George Fellows,
approximately $7,000 for the cost of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Hess declined to comment Friday, saying it was premature to
discuss a document that is still being prepared by his office.
Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, said the Commissioner had not
been told of any preliminary conclusions. ``We don't know anything
about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Revlon spokesman, James Conroy, said, ``We have not heard
anything from the city concerning a report of the corporation
counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscars trip was one in a series of ethical imbroglios in
which Safir found himself entangled this year. A few weeks after
the trip, Safir was criticized for having used city detectives to
investigate an auto accident involving his wife and to provide
security at his daughter's wedding. The commissioner said the
detectives were necessary in both cases because of threats made
against him, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani accepted his explanation,
saying the commissioner ``has excellent judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir's trip became a particularly contentious topic because it
appeared that he had planned to skip a City Council hearing on
police procedures in the wake of the police shooting of Amadou
Diallo to attend the late-night Oscar parties. Safir ultimately did
attend the hearing, after taking a late night flight home after the
ceremony. Critics said Safir suddenly changed his itinerary after
being videotaped by television crews at the Oscars. The
commissioner said he had planned to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The City Charter bars officials from accepting gifts from people
who do business with the city or in situations in which the gift is
being bestowed because of their government position. Safir has said
that Fellows, the president of Revlon, invited him and his wife,
Carol, to accompany him to the ceremony because they are friends,
not because of a professional relationship. The Safirs were guests
aboard a corporate jet that Fellows had chartered. They stayed in a
$700-a-night suite at the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The corporation counsel's report, whose release has been
described as imminent for several weeks, is scheduled to be
disseminated next week, but it may not end the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Several people, including City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler,
have formally asked the city's Conflicts of Interest Board, an
independent body, to review Safir's trip. While Hess' review is
advisory, the conflicts board is officially charged with
investigating possible ethical violations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wayne Hawley, deputy counsel for the board, said it is against
policy to discuss, or even confirm, an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler, who is chairman of the Council's Public Safety
Committee, said reimbursements for such trips do not alleviate the
ethical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a message to the average citizen that the worst
that can happen is, if you get caught, all you have to do is pay
what you should have had to pay to begin with,'' he said.

NYC MAYOR MAY GET POWER TO SLASH SPEED LIMITS TO 15 MPH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ State lawmakers are likely to give the Giuliani
administration the blanket authority it has sought to lower speed
limits on New York City streets to as low as 15 miles per hour, a
power the mayor says the city needs to make side streets safer for
pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   State law generally prohibits local governments from setting
limits lower than 25 mph, so transportation experts and policy
makers at all levels of government are eager to see how such a
change would alter the fabric of city neighborhoods, and whether it
would reduce accidents. Their interest is heightened by the fact
that a number of cities and towns around the state, including some
of New York City's suburbs, have inquired about gaining the same
power to lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
   A bill allowing the city to lower speed limits passed last year
in the state Assembly, where Democrats are the majority, and
legislators and top aides say it is likely to pass this year in
both the Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate. The state
Department of Transportation, controlled by Gov. George Pataki, has
raised some concerns about the bill but is not actively fighting
it, and the governor's office says he is not opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, the city's Department of
Transportation has taken steps to slow drivers on residential side
streets, which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has called part of his
campaign to improve the quality of life in the city. Where there
were once only a handful of speed ``humps'' _ less steeply pitched
than the traditional speed bumps _ in the city, there are now more
than 200.
</P>
<P>
   In some spots, the city has experimented with raised crosswalks
and ``neck-downs,'' the narrowing of streets where they approach
intersections through wider sidewalks and raised crosswalks.
</P>
<P>
   The bill before the Legislature would allow the city to post
speeds of 15 and 20 miles per hour wherever it also used such
physical impediments to speeding, known as traffic-calming devices,
leaving it entirely to the city's discretion which streets those
should be. Giuliani has petitioned the Legislature for that power
since last year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the great majority of city streets _ including those
where no limit is posted _ have a speed limit of 30 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   As for where the city would set speeds lower than 25 mph,
Michael Primeggia, deputy city transportation commissioner for
traffic operations, said the number of possible locations would be
in the hundreds and perhaps thousands. ``It would be
site-specific,'' he said. ``It wouldn't be wholesale. In each case,
it will be preceded by a thorough engineering study.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Giuliani, the number of pedestrian deaths and injuries has
declined sharply, as the police have stepped up traffic enforcement
at trouble spots and the Department of Transportation has taken
steps like giving pedestrians more time to cross wide streets
before the lights change. Even so, more than 200 people on foot are
killed by vehicles every year, and 12,000 are injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law is an incredibly important step toward making the
city safer for pedestrians,'' said John Kaehny, executive director
of Transportation Alternatives, a group that advocates making the
city more pedestrian-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Club of New York, the local arm of the American
Automobile Association, has voiced some reservations about the
bill, though it does not formally oppose it. ``Fifteen miles per
hour is an unrealistically low speed limit, even on streets with
traffic-calming devices,'' said Mark Kulewicz, a traffic engineer
with the group. ``I ask anybody who's uncertain about it to get in
a car and drive 15 miles per hour, and you'll have a very difficult
time doing that, even in a parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``People who live near speed humps are subjected to a
fair amount of noise, either from cars bottoming out, or from stuff
rattling around in the backs of trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the push to install the humps invariably comes from a
street's residents, according to the Department of Transportation
and state legislators who field complaints about speeding and road
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Primeggia said the likeliest spots for 15-mph limits ``are the
smallest local streets, the residential streets where you want the
traffic to be local, not people trying to cut through to avoid
congestion on the major boulevards.''
</P>
<P>
   Another target would be side streets adjoining major traffic
arteries like Queens Boulevard, Flatbush Avenue or the Grand
Concourse, where people turn off the thoroughfares onto smaller
roads at relatively high speeds, Kaehny said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the No. 1 situation where pedestrians get hit by cars,
when the driver is making a turn too fast and hits someone in a
crosswalk,'' Kaehny said. ``By our analysis, that's how 17 percent
of pedestrian deaths happen.''
</P>
<P>
   State law allows limits below 25 mph immediately in front of
schools, but advocates of lower speeds say that the danger area for
children is often elsewhere, at back exits from school yards, or at
busy intersections a block or two from campus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the bill stalled in the Senate Transportation
Committee. This year, it has moved out of the Transportation
Committee and to the powerful Rules Committee, controlled by
Majority Leader Joseph Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some minor issues to work out, but we're confident
they will be worked out,'' said John McArdle, a spokesman for
Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the concerns raised by the state Department of
Transportation are not likely to stall the bill again. State
transportation officials are worried about instances when lower
speeds on city streets could affect state highways _ for example,
by causing traffic to back up at an expressway off-ramp. But city
officials say they would make any such speed-limit changes in
consultation with the state.

FORMER KNICK ARRESTED IN SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ The Nashville police Friday arrested Dontae'
Jones, the former New York Knicks and Boston Celtics player, and
accused him and another man of shooting and injuring seven people
in April outside a Nashville nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was the Knicks' third selection in the first round of
the 1996 draft, surrendered to police early Friday afternoon after
news reports had named him as a suspect in the shootings, which
took place after a Nashville street festival.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch Jones, 24, was charged with felony reckless
endangerment and felony vandalism. He was immediately released on
$7,000 bail, a Metro Nashville Police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The second man, Karshma Dardy, 26, was arrested Thursday in
connection with the shooting and faces the same charges as Jones.
He was also released on bail. No court date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the two men were connected to a Nashville
rap-music promotion company called Keep It Wicked Entertainment,
members of which were involved in a heated argument April 25 with a
Memphis rap group that erupted into the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   According to official reports and witnesses, the Memphis group
had paid Jones' company for the right to perform in an urban music
and entertainment festival called Street Nic in downtown Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But the festival ended before the group performed. Members of
the rap group then went to a well-publicized party at the Players
Draft House nightclub in southern Nashville looking for
representatives of Keep It Wicked Entertainment to get their money
back.
</P>
<P>
   The police say that is when the arguing and shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Allen, 26, an event coordinator who organized the party
at the nightclub, said she hid in a walk-in refrigerator inside the
club for about 15 minutes when she heard there was shooting
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing next to Dontae' Jones earlier that night and he
was yelling and cussing,'' Allen said. ``I walked away from him and
he threatened my life and my best friend's life. So when we heard
there was shooting outside, about eight of us hid in the cooler
until it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Tyce, a security guard hired by the club to patrol the
party of about 1,000 people, was shot in the stomach. He told the
police that he had seen Jones and Dardy firing handguns in his
direction in the parking lot. Tyce, whose car was damaged by
bullets, was the most seriously hurt of the seven people shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who grew up in Nashville, was the junior-college player
of the year after averaging 28.7 points for Northeast Mississippi
Community College during the 1994-95 season.
</P>
<P>
   He played the next season at Mississippi State, where he
averaged 14.7 points and was named the most valuable player of the
Southeastern Conference tournament after his team advanced to the
Final Four, where it lost to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Jones left college in his junior year to play for the Knicks,
who drafted him with the 21st pick overall in the 1996 draft. But
he was sidelined for his entire rookie season after foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 season, he played for the Celtics and averaged
2.9 points a game. His contract was not renewed for this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones is convicted of the charges against him, sentences
might range anywhere from one year to four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Torry Johnson, the Nashville attorney general, said it was too
early to comment specifically on the case. &QL;

COURT HEARS CASE AGAINST SELECTIVE REPEAL OF COMMUTER TAX  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut
charged in court Friday that the new law repealing the commuter tax
only for New York state residents was politically motivated and
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Justice Barry Cozier of state Supreme Court
in Manhattan said he would try to rule on the law's validity by
June 29. In two weeks, lawyers for the State of New York will argue
in defense of the law, which is scheduled to take effect July 1.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's session, Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general
of Connecticut who appeared on behalf of his state, was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very confident that the tax will be struck down,'' he
said. ``The only question is when and what court.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said that as a matter of policy, he opposed any
commuter tax.
</P>
<P>
   But if New York City was to have such a tax, then it should be
applied equally, he said, mirroring the position he took in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to strike down the commuter tax as it existed
for 33 years,'' Blumenthal told Cozier. ``Nor are we here claiming
that citizens of Connecticut should not pay for their fair share of
the services that they enjoy while in fact they work here in New
York City.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``People similarly situated ought to be treated
similarly.''
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 commuters, 58 percent of whom live in New York
State, pay the tax, which is .45 of 1 percent on earned income for
most people. The change in the tax code would cost New York City at
least $210 million in lost revenue from commuters from the New York
suburbs. Repealing the tax for out-of-state commuters as well would
bring the lost total to $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   About 240,000 residents of New Jersey and about 86,000 from
Connecticut commute into the city, according to lawyers and legal
papers filed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, like Connecticut, would prefer to see the commuter
tax disappear entirely, and New York City wants a return to the
original law that taxed all commuters.
</P>
<P>
   But the parties, including several out-of-state commuters who
had also sued, were united Friday in their opposition to the new
law.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Rubin, a lawyer with the City Corporation Counsel's office,
told the judge, ``This statute was targeted at New York City.'' She
added that the new law could not be justified given the history of
its enactment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature introduced and passed the legislation because
of its incredibly parochial concerns,'' she said, ``not an actual
statewide concern.''
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the closely contested special election for
a State Senate seat for Rockland and Orange counties that prompted
Senate leaders, in an effort to sway voters of the commuter-rich
district, to change the commuter tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rubin also contended that the state may not repeal the
commuter tax without seeking permission from the city, through what
is called a ``home rule'' message.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick DeAlmeida, a New Jersey deputy attorney general,
suggested that the new law was a kind of economic protectionism,
which would penalize those who ``cross the border from New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has essentially erected a fence around New York
City'' for New Jersey commuters, he said, adding, ``There's no
justification for that discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the commuters who had filed suit, Richard Swanson, a
lawyer from Ridgewood, N.J., cited what he said was the sponsors'
justification that the change would allow residents of New York
outside the city to be able to spend more of their money on the
city's restaurants, theaters and museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that really is the justification,'' he told the judge,
``how on the green earth does that rationale not apply equally to
someone from New Jersey or Connecticut?''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It can only be explained one way _ lack of political
representation in Albany.'' He said that was the ``worst kind of
taxation without representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York did
not argue their case before the judge Friday. They are scheduled to
appear on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brown, a spokesman for Spitzer, said that the office was
still preparing its legal papers for the judge, but that as far as
New York City is concerned, ``our position is that the State
Legislature has the power to impose or repeal taxes'' without
seeking the local government's permission.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Breaking assurances given to Washington,
a long column of Russian peacekeeping troops entered Kosovo and its
capital early Saturday morning amid scenes of wild celebration by
local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The troops, who had been stationed in Bosnia as part of the
peacekeeping force there, continued on to the suburb of Kosovo
Polje, where they halted.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the movement of the
troops into the Kosovo capital, hours before NATO peacekeepers were
to have entered the Serbian province, was a mistake and that the
soldiers would be ordered to leave. In Washington, Clinton
administration officials went into an emergency meeting to try to
find out what had happened and how they had been left unaware of
the movement.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian solder, Yevgeny Sadovsky, said: ``We came from Bosnia,
from Tuzla, and Ugljevik, and we are supposed to stay here for two
weeks, and then go back to Bosnia. We just came to prepare the
airport for our troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people packed the streets of Pristina to welcome
the Russian troops, firing pistols and automatic weapons into the
air and throwing flowers on Russian armored personnel carriers and
jeeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' said Yvonne Stankovic, one of the Serbs
celebrating here. ``It may not be victory, but it shows NATO we are
not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ilija Karalic: ``The United States is not the only country
in the world. Our Russian brothers are here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians arrived in a column of some 50 military vehicles
and trucks as NATO peacekeeping forces on the border with Macedonia
prepared to move into Kosovo later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The unilateral Russian entry into Kosovo is sure to cause a new
crisis with Washington. It came despite promises Friday from
Ivanov, the foreign minister, that Russia's troops would not enter
the province before NATO did.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov told CNN Saturday morning: ``The reasons for this are
being determined. They have been ordered to leave Kosovo
immediately and to await further orders.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman in Brussels, Belgium, said Saturday morning
that he had no details about the Russian action.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had been shocked earlier by reports that Russian
troops from Russia's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia had moved
Friday through Yugoslavia and Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, and
might be heading south to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore had publicly said Friday that the
Russians would not move before NATO did. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott, who was flying from Moscow to Brussels after talks
broke down on how NATO and Russian forces would interact in Kosovo,
turned his airplane around and headed back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, while seeking to have Russians
help solve the diplomatic crisis, had failed to negotiate a serious
peacekeeping role for the Russians under the U.N. mandate on
Thursday authorizing foreign troops to move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians had refused to serve directly under NATO command
and had backed Belgrade in insisting that the peacekeepers serve
under a U.N. flag, and not simply as a NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials stressed on Friday that 30 nations wanted to
participate in the Kosovo force, known as KFOR, a more
representative grouping than the 19 nations of NATO that waged a
78-day air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, the crowd in Pristina fired hundreds of rounds
of ammunition into the air, kissed the Russian soldiers and jumped
upon their armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   They shouted slogans like, ``Serbia, Russia,'' ``Yeltsin,
Yeltsin, Yeltsin'' and ``We and the Russians, we are 300 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the crowd shouted insults aimed at the United States
and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Russian soldiers displayed the three-fingered Serbian salute.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops had painted over the SFOR on their vehicles _
the acronym for the peacekeeping forces in Bosnia _ with KFOR, the
name of the Kosovo peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians and the Serbs, both Slavic peoples, also share
similar Orthodox faiths. While Yugoslav officials feel Moscow is
pursuing its own interests here, they are nonetheless glad to have
public support from Moscow and to embarrass the NATO alliance,
which had negotiated a peace that felt to Yugoslavs like a
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, during the war with NATO, Russia refused to provide
Belgrade with significant aid or even to lift sanctions. There is
no great love between Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, and the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. Russia's special envoy for
the Balkans, Victor Chernomyrdin, was an important factor in
getting Milosevic to agree to the bulk of NATO's terms.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, inspired by a message on local television
here that Russian forces would arrive at 10 p.m., about 3,000 local
Serbian residents gathered in the main square here to greet the
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, boisterous and noisy, waved Serbian and Yugoslav
flags and burned an American one. The sound of gunfire, from shots
fired into the air from balconies and the streets, sounded like an
infantry invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, however, did not arrive until about 1:30 a.m.,
when there were still nearly 2,000 people in the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian move is not likely to comfort the ethnic Albanians
who have remained in Pristina or the nearly 1 million who were
pushed out of their homes by the Serbs. They are likely to be less
eager to return quickly to Kosovo from the refugee camps, and that
may have been one of Belgrade's ideas when it allowed the Russians
to move in.
