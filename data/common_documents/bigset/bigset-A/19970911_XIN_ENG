<HEADLINE> Two Hours On the Way to the 15th CPC National Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 60 delegates from
China's largest and wealthiest city of Shanghai today boarded a
plane headed for China's capital Beijing, where the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is to be convened.
</P>
<P>
Excited and prepared for a grand event, the delegates,
representing the city's 1.17 million Party members and the 13
million population, had hardly taken their seats before heated
discussions began.
</P>
<P>
Delegate Zhu Jiping became a popular figure, constantly
approached by other delegates concerned about scientific
development in the city.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, along with colleagues in the municipal science and
technology committee, has come up with the basic idea for the
acceleration of the industrialization process of high technology
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"The output value from the hi-tech sector will take up over 20
percent of the city's total industrial output value by the year
2000, which is 5.2 percentage points higher than the present," Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of Shanghai Automobile Industrial Group, Chen
Xianglin echoed Zhu, pointing out that progress in science and
technology is the ultimate force needed to push his company
forward.
</P>
<P>
"We have set targets for the company," he said. "First, it is
to make 100 billion yuan by the end of this century. Second, it
will strive to rank itself among the world's top 500 companies in
terms of overall ability."
</P>
<P>
Delegates from state-owned enterprises sat in a group, spending
their hours on the place talking about reforms in the sector. They
voiced their confidence in the future of state businesses when
they said they were encouraged by Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
May 29 speech to the Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
A series of statistics listed by Guan Zhuangmin, Party
secretary of the Baoshan Steel and Steel Corporation, amazed the
group.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the century, the corporation will be able to
claim that it has spent only 22 years to catch up with what took
developed countries 55 years to achieve, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, Party members in the corporation, who take up
24.2 percent of the total workforce, contributed the most with
their work styles, which in turn encouraged others to work harder."
</P>
<P>
"The Party organization and political advantages in state-owned
enterprises are the most valuable elements for revitalization,"
said Guan, who will present a related report to the congress.
</P>
<P>
"The congress marks a new beginning for the cause of socialism
in China," said Meng Jianzhu, deputy secretary of the Shanghai
Shanghai. "As long as we adhere to the basic routes and policies
mapped out during the congress, a rejuvenated China will
undoubtedly present itself."
</P>
<P>
Huang Ju, member of the Party Politburo of the CPC Central
Committee and Party secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Party
Committee, and Xu Kuangdi, mayor of Shanghai, greeted the
delegates at their hotel.

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges PNA, Israel to Rebuild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) must rebuild their confidence in order
to restore the troubled Middle East peace process, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright said here today.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a press conference after holding talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the Middle East
peace process has been stalled and the PNA and Israel have lost
mutual trust. The two sides need to restore a partnership which is
beneficial to peace and stability of this region, she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged the PNA to strengthen security cooperation with
Israel in fighting against terrorism and achieving peace of this
region.
</P>
<P>
"My message is very clear that the PNA must take action to root
out terrorism and its intrastructure and I will convey this
message to PNA Chairman Arafat when I meet him tomorrow," she
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she urged Israel to shape a better
environment for revitalizing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel has the responsibility in shaping such an environment
which will guarantee the successes of the Middle East peace
process, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the key player in this process and it will
live up to the expectations of the people of this region and help
them build a beautiful future, she said.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question whether the United State still wants
all parties to implement the Oslo Accords, Albright said the
United States believes that all aspects of the Accords must be
implemented.
</P>
<P>
"It is important also not to abandon the Interim Agreement,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Under the Interim Agreement, Israel must complete its troop
redeployment in the West Bank by mid-1998 in three stages.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the same conference, Netanyahu stressed that the PNA
must take concrete action to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here today for a three-day visit, her first to
the region as secretary of state, which will also take her to the
PNA controlled areas.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Inmates Reduced Jail Term, Released on Parole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and thirty-two
prisoners today were granted court-ordered prison term reductions
or parole in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Judges from the regional Higher People's Court and the
Intermediate People's Court of Lhasa, the regional capital,
announced the adjudications in the Regional Prison in the northern
suburb of Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
A presiding judge from the regional court told Xinhua, "The
target of reforming prisoners is to help them repent and turn a
new leaf at the earliest possible time, and to become useful
members of society."
</P>
<P>
Those who have shown evidence of reform and have done good
deeds while in prison will be treated with tolerance, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ciwang, one of the inmates who was paroled, showed his
excitement for the ruling, saying, "The government has provided us
with good conditions for reform in the prison, though my criminal
activities had caused severe damage to society."
</P>
<P>
The man learned how to weave wool carpets during his
imprisonment. "I will make a living as a weaver and become a
law-abiding civilian," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ciren Lamu, a female prisoner who received a four-year sentence
for endangering state security, was granted a one-year cut in her
term. "I'm young and was hooked by others to
advocate 'Independence of Tibet'." she said. "Now I have come to
know I was wrong."
</P>
<P>
She continued: "I know very little about the history of
Tibet. The living conditions and food in the prison are very
good. I will continue to strengthen my reform here."
</P>
<P>
According to Losang Gelie, warden of the regional prison, local
judicial departments in Tibet have reformed criminals in line with
the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prisoners have been taught professional skills
and other useful knowledge, so as to help them reform themselves,
he noted, adding that a number of prisoners will receive sentence
reductions every year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean C. Bank Urged to Rein in Money Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The National Merchant Bank,
Zimbabwe's largest black-owned financial institution, today said
the Central Bank should maintain tight reins on inflation in
light of recent indications of further money supply expansion.
</P>
<P>
Group Chairman Paddy Zhanda said high government expenditure
and a bloated budget deficit problem called for the need to
re-visit the regime of austere monetary measures.
</P>
<P>
''Due to high government expenditure and difficulties in
controlling the fiscal deficit, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe will
have to maintain a tight monetary policy in the short- to
medium-term to contain inflation,'' he said, referring to the
group's results for the six months to June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged current efforts by the monetary authorities to
keep inflation, noting, however, that the central bank should
adopt a responsive rediscount rate policy in order to pass on the
benefits of falling inflation to the productive sector.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on last month's decision by the World Bank to
resume balance of payments support for Zimbabwe's reform program,
Zhanda said the move would stimulate business activity and
bolster economic growth.
</P>
<P>
''It should be noted, however, that Zimprest (Zimbabwe program
for economic and social transformation) is still to be officially
launched,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- It was announced here
tonight that the Chinese Embassy in Colombo is making further
efforts to look for the five missing crew men of the Chinese cargo
ship which was attacked and set ablaze in Sri Lanka Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for the Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese
Foreign Ministry in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
Wu Hongbo, said tonight that it has been confirmed that one of the
five missing crew men is from Hong Kong and the four others are
from China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The rescued 27 crew men from the ship have been taken into a
hotel in Trincomalee, a port city in northeastern Sri Lanka, the
spokesman said, adding that diplomats of the Chinese Embassy in
Colombo had arrived at the city and called on them.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that Chinese Embassy officials had requested the Sri
Lankan Navy to continue to search for the missing Chinese sailors
and tow the cargo ship into Trincomalee Port, and had also asked
the Office of the International Committee of the Red Cross in
Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka, to approach the Tamil Tigers over
the whereabouts of the missing sailors.
</P>
<P>
When representatives of the ship owner, China Ocean Shipping
Company (HK), arrive in Sri Lanka, Chinese diplomats will consult
with them on how to help arrange the rescued crew men back to the
motherland as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 34,873-ton cargo vessel sailed out of Hong Kong waters two
weeks ago and was scheduled to dock at Trincomalee on Tuesday
before sailing to Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, some 15 rebel boats carrying dozens of Tamil
Tiger fighters attacked the cargo ship. A few of the
rocket-propelled grenades fired by the Tamil Tiger rebels struck
the ship and the engine room caught fire and was completely
damaged.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Plans New Road Safety Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A road safety program
code-named "arrive alive" was being planned, South African
Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said today.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to reduce the road accident rate,
which is costing the country billions of Rand each year, Maharaj
said at a press conference in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
According to Maharaj, a total of 517,669 road accidents last
year had cost the country 11,918 billion Rand (2.5 billion U.S.
Dollars). A total of 9,609 fatalities had been recorded.
</P>
<P>
The proposed program would focus on law enforcement,
communication, and speedy and effective adjudication, as well as
professionalism in traffic control and technology concerned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The program would concentrate law enforcement on speeding,
driving under the influence of alcohol, wearing of seat belts,
unsafe overtaking, ignoring traffic signals and driving lincensess.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles would also have their tyres, lights, brakes, and
steering inspected as well as being checked for over-loading.

He also expected to see the number of drunk drivers involved
in accidents reduced from seven to two percent, and pedestrians

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ramos Keeps People Guessing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Filipinos will have to
continue guessing their president's plan in the 1998 polls as
President Fidel Ramos reiterated today that he will make a
decision in November on whether to run for another term.
</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos evaded answering whether
he will run again in 1998, but stressed he will reveal his
decision in November when his ruling Lakas-NUCD party convenes its
national convention.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also failed to clarify a statement made by him last
Friday that he was "keeping his options open." Instead, he again
explained that his options included choosing a successor from his
party for the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
The statement had been interpreted by many as a hint that Ramos
will probably seek another term under an amended constitution, and
gave rise to wide anxieties among the opposition, the Catholic
Church and the business sector.
</P>
<P>
Stubbornly declining to elaborate his options, Ramos told
reporters that he had to keep his options secret till November in
order to keep his party united.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, the party, which has seven presidential
aspirants for the next presidency, will be fragmented and will
risk losing grip on power after the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he will select his successor in November under party
rules, but stopped short of specifying who -- one of the ruling
party's presidential contenders or himself -- will be chosen as
the successor.
</P>
<P>
Also today, the country's two prominent opponents of charter
change -- Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin and former
president Corazon Aquino -- expressed doubt that Ramos will not
seek another term.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Sin said his doubt was based on his
conversation with Ramos at a dinner meeting Tuesday night.
According to Sin, Ramos gave no answer when the archbishop asked
him whether to run again if the charter-change drive succeeds.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Ramos also rejected the demands of Sin and
Aquino to make a statement that he opposes changes to the charter
and will not seek re-election, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
Both Sin and Aquino vowed to press ahead the September 21 rally
in central Manila to protest against the charter change drive,
which has been pushed hard by Ramos' supporters in the Supreme
Court and the Congress since last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's 1987 constitution, Ramos can only serve one
single six-year term, and must step down in June 1998 when his
term expires.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos' supporters have sought to change the constitution to
lift term limits of all elective government officials, including
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' dubious stance on charter change and his term limit will
affect the economy as investors are concerned over political
stability in the country, economy analysts here warned, citing the
turmoil in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The country's stock market rebounded sharply Tuesday, with its
main index surging 5.8 percent to close at 2228.85 points, one day
after Ramos declared that the 1998 polls will proceed as scheduled
and he will not proclaim martial law.
</P>
<P>
But today, the main index for the local bourse dropped 1.17
percent to close at 2212.77 points, due to reports that Ramos, at
his meeting with Sin, still insisted on "keeping his options
open." Analysts said investors' waning concerns over political
stability were revived by the reports.

<HEADLINE> Mentally Handicapped Sterilized by Force in France: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 15,000 women diagnosed
as "mentally handicapped" by French institutions were reportedly
forced to submit to sterilization over the past 20 to 30 years,
a recent issue of a satirical daily called Charlie Hebdo reported.
</P>
<P>
This report has created a scandal since France denied
permitting forced sterilization to "improve human quality."
</P>
<P>
The report has been confirmed by Nicole Diederich, a researcher
at the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM),
who said the victims of this practice number in thousands in
France.
</P>
<P>
She said she once tried to warn the French government against
forced sterilizations, which she said were "until now hidden" by
the institutions engaged in the practice.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the Gironde region of southwest France, 35
percent of 260 women being treated for mental problems in some
unspecified psychiatrical and medical "establishments" were
sterilized.
</P>
<P>
The National Consultative Committee of Ethics (CCNE) of France
protested in 1996 against sterilization by force in France, Agence
France-Presse said.
</P>
<P>
Women who have a weak I.Q., who have failed in schools or have
difficulty in expressing their feelings could easily be subjected
to forced sterilization, said Diederich.
</P>
<P>
Other vague and highly disputable "mental weeknesses" shown by
women can also lead to their sterilization, often at the demand or
with the agreement of their families.
</P>
<P>
For example, a 40-year-old woman identified as "Michelle" was
forced to submit to sterilization at the age of 20 by her mother
because she was "annoying" and wanted to get married.
</P>
<P>
Charlie Hebdo said the figure of 15,000 only covers women of
the present generation and not those of previous generations or
immigrant women, many of whom were reportedly forced to have
sterilization operations in the 1960's.
</P>
<P>
In France, a total of 44,000 women with mental problems are now
being treated in hospitals, while an unspecified number are being
treated by psychiatric institutions or doctors and psychiatrists.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Promotes Economic Ties With Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Industry and Commerce
Minister Nathan Shmuyarira will lead a trade and investment
delegation to Kuwait and Dubai next month in order to strengthen
the economic ties with the Mideast countries.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said in a statement today that the trade mission
scheduled from October 24 to 30 is aimed at encouraging
Zimbabwean companies to tap the vast potential markets in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
''Kuwait and Dubai are potential markets for Zimbabwean
products, and local companies are urged to use this opportunity
to identify possible joint venture partners,'' said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Kuwait recently signed an economic and technical
cooperation agreement set to increase trade relations between the
two countries, as well as contribute to the process of
strengthening the two countries' respective scientific and
economic bases.
</P>
<P>
Trade relations between Zimbabwe and Kuwait have been growing
steadily over the years, but slackened due to the 1990/91 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the countries would now continue to build on
this relationship by exchanging trade and investment missions and
other activities which would give greater economic substance to
their cordial political relations.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipbuilding Industry Making Fast Progress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding industry
has developed remarkably in recent years to become the world's
third-largest manufacturer and sixth-highest recipient of orders
for new vessels.
</P>
<P>
Five percent of the ships built annually in the world come from
China, and Chinese-made ships are of equal quality to Korean-made
models and close to those manufactured in Japan, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attribute the achievements to the industry's
efforts in accelerating restructuring, granting enterprises the
right of self-decision on internal affairs, increasing
infrastructural investment, and giving priority to science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, in 1982, the China State Shipbuilding
Corporation (CSSBC) was established on the basis of the former
Sixth Machine-Building Ministry, to become the country's first
ministry to drop its administrative functions and turn into a
market-oriented economic entity.
</P>
<P>
The two-decade reform, especially the new target set by the
14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992 to
build a socialist market economy, has pushed forward the
development of the country's shipbuilding industry.
</P>
<P>
The corporation experienced its fastest growth in the period of
1992-96, with its annual output value and tonnage of vessels built
reaching 17.9 billion yuan and 18.66 billion tons, increasing at
14 percent and 31 percent annually, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the manufacturer also earned 6.2 billion
yuan from ship repairs, and manufactured 3.91 million kw of
diesel engines for ship use.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the meantime, China exported 3.15 billion US dollars worth
of vessels, up 29.3 percent annually. Ships are the sixth-largest
export item among the country's machinery and electrical products.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992-96, CSSBC invested nearly 10 billion yuan to build
and renovate its infrastructures so as to increase its
shipbuilding capacity by one million tons, dock-volume by 200,000
tons, and diesel engine manufacturing capacity by one million kw.
</P>
<P>
The company's shipbuilding capacity currently stands at 2.5
million tons, and is expected to exceed 3.8 million tons by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, China has drastically reduced its technological
gap with the advanced countries. The country is now capable of
manufacturing 4,000-TEUs container ships, 46,000-ton
chemicals-carrying vessels, 150,000-ton oil tanks, 52,000-ton
multipurpose vessels, and high-performance passenger
hydrofoils. CSSBC is also able to repair vessels with a capacity
of 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rapidly growing shipbuilding industry has
contributed to the development of the country's defense sector.
The Chinese navy has been equipped with newly-developed warships
designed and manufactured by the corporation.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the company told Xinhua that it is the reform
policy that has boosted the fast growth of the industry, and
therefore new reform steps must be taken to realize a new round of
development in the industry.
</P>
<P>
CSSBC is now working to build up a modern enterprise system in
its subordinate firms. So far, it has one listed firm and several
enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
According to CSSBC sources, the corporation plans to do more to
meet the needs of national economic development and the defense
sector, while largely increasing its exports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, China is expected to rank among
advanced shipbuilding countries, and by 2010 is expected to become
a major global competitor in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers Urged to Prepare for Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai today urged farmers and the
rest of the population to brace for a possible drought during the
forthcoming rainy season.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole country should prepare to manage the looming
drought which has been directly linked to the El Nino phenomenon
and expected to be the worst in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
''We have done preparations to adequately inform the farming
community and the general public to prepare themselves both
physically and mentally for possibly the worst drought in our
living memories,'' Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
He added, ''we cannot stop the looming drought but we
certainly can prepare and manage it because we cannot manage to
have our people queuing for mealie-meal as was the case with the
1991/92 drought. It happened because we had no information but
now we have it.''
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, was monitoring the situation and by
the second week of October the country would be certain which
direction to take.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was currently making adequate
preparations to avert a possible disaster.
</P>
<P>
''Our main worry is that of livestock, and we need to put in
place necessary measures so that we curtail the looming danger of
having our herd again depleted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister added, ''we really have to be careful, but in
terms of food we really need not worry much as we have a huge
wheat and maize crop coming. But for all we know the El Nino may
even disappear much to our benefit.''
</P>
<P>
The El Nino, which occurs every three or four years, is the
warming of sea waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening rain clouds
and unleashing natural disasters such as droughts and floods.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect the phenomenon, which intensified in June this
year, to get worse. Researchers in southern Africa said El Nino
is responsible for only five percent of the droughts in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Old Chinese Revolutionary Base Better Off These Days (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Li Yanping, a young farmer in
Yan'an, in China's Shannxi province in the North, earned 10,000
yuan (1,200 US dollars) last year from his six hectares of apple
trees.
</P>
<P>
Although he and his three other family members live in a cave
dwelling, it has a brick face and is practically identical to any
modern Chinese home, with its modern beds, sofa, color TV, and
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
But, the portraits of Chairman Mao and Deng Xiaoping in a
prominent place on a wall of the livingroom remind the visitor
that this was once a Chinese revolutionary base.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Mao liberated us poor people from the oppressive
landlords and Deng Xiaoping and his opening-up policies have put
us on the road to prosperity," said Li's father, a former head of
Miaogou village here.
</P>
<P>
The old man explains that the barren hills around the village
could hardly put enough food on the table of farmers here only ten
years ago. But they've now been changed to orchards thanks to rural
reforms that allowed peasants to get away from the traditional way
of farming and to work in their own interest.
</P>
<P>
Last year, per-capita income in Miaogou village was 5,000 yuan,
well above the national average. And the small village is
indicative of changes that have taken place in Yanan.
</P>
<P>
From 1936 to 1948, it was where the central committee of the
Communist Party had its headquarters. Chairman Mao lived and
worked there. And while it became a symbol of the successful
Chinese revolution, it unfortunately also became synonymous with
poverty after libration in 1949. The ever worsening soil erosion
deprived the local people of their basic means of living.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhou Enlai was said to have shed tears when he heard
that many of the locals still had nothing but chaff and wild
plants to eat for half the year when he revisited the place in
1973.

<TEXT>
<P>
The late Premier's desire to feed the people who had supported
the revolution was finally put into action in the 1980s when the
central government increased financial assistance to the
poverty-stricken area.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1996, the central and local government spent more
than 200 million yuan on farmland so that each household could
grow its own grain. The local government also sold the sterile
hillside land to farmers at a very low price and encouraged them
to plant trees and orchards.
</P>
<P>
These measures helped raise the forest coverage in Yanan from
14 percent a decade ago to 43 percent, and last year's grain
harvest was a record high at 500 kg for each of the 1.9 million
rural people. Per capita income exceeded 1,000 yuan for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 hectares of orchards there are expected to produce
1.5 billion kg of fruit a year by the year 2000, which will help
raise per capita incomes to around 2,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
But what really makes the old revolutionary base different is
its petroleum oil business. Crude oil production is expected to
reach 2.5 million tons this year, 70 times the annual output in
1977, and the industry will have pre-tax profits of over a billion
yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
Today, Yan'an has the look of a modern city with its tall
buildings, beauty parlours, libraries, public swimming-pools,
children's parks, and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita living space in the urban area is eight sq.m. and
there are 22 phones per 100 people, and 3,000 people with their
mobile phones that can reach other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Gone are the images of local yokels with a red-rag belt tied
around the waist of a black cotton-padded jacket and a white towel
wrapped around their forehead - but that revolutionary legacy of
the Chinese past is not gone.
</P>
<P>
There are about 400 old revolutionary sites that are well
preserved and can be seen by the growing number of tourists. Red
Army veterans have been invited to speak to the younger
generations about the experience.
</P>
<P>
"My schedule is as tight as it ever was," said 76-year-old
veteran Zhang Qingyi who has addressed more than 40 gatherings
this year alone.

HARARE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is among five
African states selected by Japan for consistent economic support
in the next five years as Tokyo cuts back on aid to many
developing countries because of corruption and instability.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency reported today that President of the
Society for International Development of Japan Ryokichi Hirono
told a Zimbabwe journalist attending a fellowship program in
Tokyo that Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ghana and Zimbabwe had been
selected on an experimental basis beginning this year.

''We selected countries that were politically stable,
perceived to be even remotely interested in development and
seemed to have potential,'' said Hirono, who is also
international aid advisor to Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Projects were expected to focus on increasing food production,
broadening education, promoting a good economic climate and
training civil servants.
</P>
<P>
The Japaneseo government has cut its spending in government
departments and foreign aid by 10 percent due to an economic
downturn which has affected most east Asian economies.

Half of Japanese foreign aid is directed to Southeast Asia,

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Ensure Women's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official
today urged the members of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to ensure that the status of women is enhanced,
reported the official Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
This appeal was made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence
Shimba while speaking at the opening of a three-day international
conference for women and children in the sub-region in the
capital here.
</P>
<P>
Women's status should be enhanced so that they can participate
in making economic decisions for their countries, said Shimba,
stressing that women have a "vital" role to play in the economic
development of their countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that the economic policies and structural adjustment
programs of the SADC countries in the region should be formulated
and monitored in a "gender sensitive" way so that women can
participate effectively in their implementation.
</P>
<P>
ZANA quoted the minister as lamenting that despite the efforts
that have been made by various non-governmental organizations,
women empowerment has continued to be blocked by various
obstacles in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shimba placed emphasis on the need for the establishment of
institutions aimed at encouraging women to be elected to public
office.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the world and international organizations to
address the issue of the girl child.
</P>
<P>
Girls have continued to be restricted to traditional areas of
education in various parts of the world, making them unable to
contribute effectively to the future development of their nation,
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Shimba's remarks accorded with the spirit of the "Declaration
on Gender and Development" signed by the SADC leaders at a summit
meeting last Monday in Blantyre, Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The members of the SADC, which are striving for regional
economic integration, pledged to reach the target that 30 percent
of the women in the region will be empowered in political and
decision-making structures by the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Preparing for Opening Trade Route With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is preparing actively
for the opening of Al Waleed along the Iraqi-Syrian border as a
new trade route to facilitate the flow of foodstuffs and goods
from Syria, an Iraqi official has said.
</P>
<P>
Today's Iraqi daily "Al Thawra" quoted Iraqi Transport Under
Secretary Sabri Kadie as saying the opening up of the trading
route is in line with the oil-for-food accord signed between Iraq
and the United Nations in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which went into effect last December, allows Iraq
to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil within six months to
purchase foodstuffs and medicine to alleviate the suffering of the
Iraqi people due to the embargo imposed against Iraq since its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. The accord was renewed last June.
</P>
<P>
Kadie pointed out that all necessary measures and arrangements
have been taken to set in motion the land transport fleets that
would carry goods, commodities and passengers between Syria and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, he said, practical steps will be taken to facilitate
the flow of the transport fleet and to expedite the transport of

<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia is concerned about the
recent developments in the Middle East and will make every effort
to promote the peace process in the region, President Boris
Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference held at a Moscow
international press club.
</P>
<P>
A series of terrorist attacks weeks ago have imperiled the
Middle East peace process and worsened relations among the
concerned countries, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, as a power actively engaged in the peace process and
having its own interests in the region, has every reason to be
concerned about the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia will do its best to keep the peace process on track, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Russian-American relations, Yastrzhembsky said that he does
not think the United States is pursuing an anti-Russia policy. On
the contrary, the two countries are developing a mature
partnership, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
will hold informal meeting on November 1-2 in the eastern Russian
city of Krasnoyarsk, he said.

The meeting will help promote Russian-Japanese relations,
enhance cooperation in trade, investment and other areas between
the two countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Stronger Partnerships Between UN, NGOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called for stronger partnerships between the
United Nations and the Non-Government Organizations (NGO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the 50th annual NGO
Conference, the UN Chief said, "In 1947, the Member States of the
United nations were virtually the sole actors in the international
process, Non-government organizations were seen as supporters and
allies of the United Nations. They were important in a relatively
modest way. They were seen as mobilizers of public opinion in
support of the unique goals and values of the Charter of the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"Today, the relationship has been transformed. As the title of
this Conference recognizes, the relationship is a partnership.
Non-government organizations are now seen as essential partners
of the United Nations, not only in mobilizing public opinion,
but also in the process of deliberation and policy formulation,
and even more important in the execution of policies in work on
the ground," stressed Annan.
</P>
<P>
He said, "In a whole variety of ways, the NGOs have become
indispensable partners of the United Nations. NGOs are often
there on the ground before the international community gives
the UN the mandate to act. NGO information, guidance and
inspiration can be crucial to us at the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
"NGOs are particularly crucial in preventive diplomacy, in
humanitarian work in development and in human rights. The
relationship is complementary. Each contributes something
unique, producing a result that is greater than the sum of its
parts," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said, "The new partnership is more than
ever necessary. The world faces a daunting agenda of global
challenges. The relationship is vital because we face new enemies,
including drug-traffickers, money-launderers, gun-runners,
exploiters of young people for prostitution and currency
fraudsters. To combat them, international civil society must
mobilize. That is why Member States, governmental and
inter-governmental bodies, and non-governmental organizations work
together in partnership."
</P>
<P>
Annan proposed to target the year 2000 for the completion of
the task of launching a new and strong relationship between the
United Nations and the NGO community.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation Rate Rises to Two-Year High in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's headline inflation
rose to a two-year high last month due to steep rises in mortgage
interest payments and the cost of summer holidays, according to
official figures released today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that retail
prices rose 0.6 percent last month, taking the annual inflation
rate from 3.3 percent in July to 3.5 percent in August, the
highest level since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the underlying inflation rate, which excludes mortgage
interest payments, fell from 3.0 percent to 2.8 percent, although
it still remains above the government target figure of 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The ONS said that the main reason for the rise in the headline
inflation rate was a further increase in mortgage rates as banks
and building societies responded to July's quarter-point rise in
base rates.
</P>
<P>
Other influences were rises in te cost of clothing and
footwear, foreign holidays and big ticket household items such as
televisions, washing machines and stereo equipment following the
summer sales.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the main cause of the decline in underlying
inflation was an unexpected drop in the price of seasonal foods,
the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the figures will not affect the Bank of
England's Monetary Policy Committee, holding its monthly meeting
Wednesday and Friday. It is not expected to raise interest rates,
at least for now.

<HEADLINE> Party Leaders Visit Show on Achievement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 10 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin and
several other Chinese leaders visited an exhibition in Beijing
today which shows the outstanding accomplishments in the country
in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Themed "A Glorious Five Years -- An exhibition on Achievements
Made in Economic Development and Social Ethical and Cultural
Progress since the 14th CPC National Congress," the show in the
Beijing Exhibition Center has drawn 100,000 visitors since its
opening on September 6.
</P>
<P>
Jiang walked through all the exhibition halls during his
one-hour visit, constantly expressing his affirmations for the
achievements scored since 1992, the year the 14th Party National
Congress was convened.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's first stop at the show was a room showcasing the
progress in national minorities regions. There he was greeted by
the guide -- a girl of Mongolian ethnic group, who presented him a
Hada, a piece of silk used as a greeting gift.
</P>
<P>
In the unique Shanghai exhibition hall, Jiang hooked himself up
to a system that allows doctors to make long-distance medical
diagnoses, and talked to medical workers in Shanghai. Jiang
congratulated the researchers who developed the device, saying
that such modern scientific technology should be used for the
benefit of all.
</P>
<P>
High-tech products especially caught the attention of President
Jiang. At the electronics and raw materials halls, he inquired
in detail about the relevant information.
</P>
<P>
The president even gave a demonstration of his artistic talent
on an automatic simulated piano, playing a tune for onlookers.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also praised the exhibition hall on social ethical and
cultural progress. When briefed on some activities held for the
promotion of socialist ethical and cultural development, he
expressed his satisfaction.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Protests EU Decision on GE Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The environmentalist group
Greenpeace today protested against a decision by the European
Union on repealing bans of genetically engineered maize (GE
maize).
</P>
<P>
The EU's executive agency, the European Commission, announced
earlier in the day its decision for Austria, Italy and Luxembourg
to lift bans on usage and sales of GE maize in their countries.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace spokesperson Isabelle Meister said that despite
increasing scientific evidence of the dangers of GE plants, the
European Commission continued to allow its environmental policies
to be influenced by U.S. trade pressure.
</P>
<P>
This year's harvest of GE maize and soya has just started in
the United States and imports are expected to arrive in Europe
soon. Last year, 13 EU member states opposed the introduction of
GE maize from the U.S. while Austria and Luxembourg imposed a
national ban this February on U.S. GE maize. Their move was
followed by Italy.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the European Commission said that it has
taken the decision after carefully considering the question of
monitoring insect resistance to Bt, a gene contained in the maize.
</P>
<P>
The gene has the effect of a low dose of antibiotic and the
plant is therefore less vulnerable to insects. The risk, however,
is that continued but low doses of this antibiotic develops a
resistance in insects that could cause problems later on, the EU
press release said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the decision-making has taken into consideration
the opinions of the EU scientific committees on food, for animal
nutrition and on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Greenpeace spokesperson blamed the EU decision for
inadequate tests and information. She quoted a recent issue of the
Swiss journal Facts as reporting that two out of three beneficial
predator insect larvae died when they were fed with European corn
borer which had eaten the GE maize.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) will soon ratify a draft law on money laundering, which
will give the country's Authorities much more power to
investigate funds of drug suspects, a senior narcotics official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Matar al Muheiri, head of the Narcotics Section at the General
Directorate of Abu Dhabi Police told reporters that the UAE will
ratify a draft law on money laundering within a few months and
"this would give the authorities greater access to bank accounts

the context of organized crime which has become an international
phenomenon, said the official who attended the 11th meeting of
directors of anti-narcotics departments in the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) which concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
The draft law was published a month ago. Shortly after

eight people suspected of involvement in drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, which is to be ratified by the UAE Federal
Cabinet, follows a surge in narcotic trafficking by
international gangs in the Gulf country.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mandela Denies Abduction, Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said he had not arranged the abduction and
imprisonment in Zambia of a witness in the kidnaping trial of
his former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks in a statement issued by his office
in Cape Town on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to sensational allegations in the book written
by British journalist Fred Bridgland, based on interviews with
the witness, Katiza Cebekhulu and, among others, former Zambian
President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled Katiza's Journey, was launched in Cape Town
yesterday by former British Conservative Party parliament member
Emma Nicholson, who has sheltered Cebekhulu and championed his
cause since she discovered him in a Zambian jail in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to the book, Kaunda implicated Mandela in
Cebekhulu's 1991 abduction and imprisonment without trial in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela said in his statement that he did not arrange
for Cebekhulu to be taken out of South Africa or to be
incarcerated in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also denied having met Cebekhulu when he visited
Zambia in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Cebekhulu, before his disappearance, was among Winnie
Madikizela- Mandela's co-accused in a kidnapping and murder
trial, in which Winnie was found guilty and was later fined
15,000 Rands by an appeal court.
</P>
<P>
The book also claimed that Winnie was directly involved in the
murder of black activist Stompie and others in Soweto in 1980's.
</P>
<P>
The book describes how Nicholson, with the help of Kaunda's
successor President Frederick Chiluba, managed to trace the
missing Cebekhulu to a central Lusaka jail in 1991.
</P>
<P>
According to Zambian government's records, Cebekhulu's
abduction from South Africa indicated that Kaunda himself
believed Mandela might "have been the mastermind", claimed the
book.
</P>
<P>
Nicholson told a press conference in Cape Town yesterday that
she had been blocked on several occasions by senior South African
government officials and of the African National Congress (ANC)
from raising the matter.
</P>
<P>
Winnie, who is president of ANC National Women's League and
parliament member, told a press conference last night that all
the accusations were "cruel and depraved".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the allegations that Winnie was directly
responsible for several murders, Mandela said in his statement
that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is currently
investigating the cases.
</P>
<P>
He said he fully supported the process initiated by the
Commission's amnesty sub-committee to establish the truth of the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> EU, US Urge Bosnians to Vote in Municipal Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the
United States today urged Bosnians to cast their votes in the
coming municipal elections in their country.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique was issued following reports that the HDZ of
Bosnia-Herzegovina has announced a boycott of the forthcoming
municipal elections while the Pale leadership of the SDS is also
threatening to boycott.
</P>
<P>
"Having already been delayed on three occasions, yet another
postponement would be totally unacceptable," said the communique.
It claimed that the international community has undertaken a
tremendous effort to ensure that the elections can take place
under free and fair conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Threats of boycotts are unacceptable and must be met by a firm
reaction of the international community, especially the
signatories of the Dayton peace agreement," it added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the United States demand that all
threats of boycotts be dropped and that all Bosnians be encouraged
to fully exercise their rights to elect local leaders.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union and the U.S. called on Croatia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to use their influence to prevent
boycotts of the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
The communique warned that actions such as the illegal attempts
by the Pale SDS to intimidate and threaten the legitimate
leadership of the Republika Srpska under the guise of an election
rally will not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 international observers will be present to
monitor the municipal elections slated for September 13 and 14
while the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) has been reinforced
to 39,000 troops and has been equipped with special policing
tools such as batons, shields, tear gases and non-lethal grenades
in case of evil-intended unrests prior to and during the
elections.

committee and the scientific steering committee under the European
Commission have held a joint meeting to clarify the mad cow
disease risk status of tallow early this month.
</P>
<P>
The joint meeting advised that the risk of mad cow disease
infection presented by tallow is reduced to an acceptable level if
it is produced under three conditions.
</P>
<P>
The raw material is treated at a temperature of 133 degrees
Celsius at 3 bar pressure for at least 20 minutes prior to
rendering; the skull, brain, eyes, spinal cord and tonsils of
cattle are removed from the raw material prior to rendering.
</P>
<P>
Infectivity of the raw material can also be minimized by
sourcing it from regions or herds that are certified as mad cow
disease free.
</P>
<P>
Tallow is a fatty substance widely used as a raw material in
the pharmaceuticals industry and also for making candles, soap and
machinery grease.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Proposes Turkish Cypriots Participate in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
proposed that the Turkish Cypriots participate in its accession
talks with the European Union (EU) as part of the Cyprus
Republic's official delegation, government spokesman Manolis
Christofides announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said at a press briefing that the proposal was not
rejected by the EU, which, in the meantime, did not set this as a
term to the start of the accession talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that if other proposals are made
regarding Turkish Cypriot participation in the accession talks,
"they will be studied, but always measured against the
safeguarding of the legal government of the Republic as the sole
interlocutor in these negotiations."
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction with the statements made Tuesday
by Jacques Poos, the president of the EU Council of Ministers
and Luxembourg Foreign Minister, on Cyprus' bid to become a member
of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Poos said after a meeting with Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides that the EU would abide by all its decisions and
fulfill obligations it had assumed regarding the start of the
EU-Cyprus accession talks which was reaffirmed by the EU in July
to begin early next year.
</P>
<P>
the Turkish Cypriot side, however, rejected EU's decision to
start Cyprus' accession talks and refused to further negotiate
settlements of the protracted Cyprus problem with the Cypriot
government after two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct talks in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
coup by the Greek Cypriot seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus," which was recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Producers Urged to Eye Overseas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan manufacturers should
double efforts to expand overseas market so as to make Kenya
become a newly industrialized state in the next century, Vice
President George Saitoti said here today.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the Kenyan producers and manufacturers to look outward
to the regional and other markets," and to make their products
more competitive worldwide, he said at the opening ceremony of
the 23rd New Kenya Trades Exhibition.
</P>
<P>
However, he lamented that within the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA), the main destination of Kenya
manufactured goods exports, "there is a gradual decline and
consequential shortfall in meeting the targets set."
</P>
<P>
The down trend is partly due to tariff barriers against Kenyan
products adopted by some COMESA members contrary to the COMESA
Treaty signed by 10 southern and eastern African states in 1993
with a goal to set up a full free trade area by 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to increase our exports in the region, the Kenyan
government will continue to provide an enabling environment for
our industries so that they are able to produce competitive
products," Saitoti pledged.
</P>
<P>
The annual exhibition, a leading indoor industrial and
commercial show in the COMESA region, is expected to help
participants capture and retain regional and other export
markets, according to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
The five-day fair, under the theme of "Trade Challenges in the
Regional Market", has attracted almost 70 exhibitors, five of
them from China, Italy, Tanzania, Indonesia and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of items of commodities and merchandise including
toys, textiles, home and office furnishing, processed food and
beverage, plastic ware, paper products, plaited craft, coffee,
building materials are on the display.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Increases in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Underlying inflation went up
in August with the three-months annualized rate rising to 4.2
percent from negative 0.8 percent in July, according to the
latest monthly economic review by Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
CBK said the underlying inflation jumped due to depreciation
of the Shilling against major convertible currencies early last
month following the key loan cut by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
CBK said reduced expansion in money supply and credit by the
banking system however helped moderate the effects on inflation
of the loss of the Shilling on the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The bank added that the overall month-on-month inflation fell
to 7.7 percent last month from 8.9 percent in July due to
improved supply of basic foods.
</P>
<P>
The decline in overall inflation was in goods and services
consumed by the lower income group whose month-on-month rate
dropped to 7.8 percent last month from 9.8 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
But the month-on-month inflation for the middle and upper
income groups increased respectively to 7.5 percent and 10.9
percent from 5.7 percent and 8.5 percent in July.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Ex-Leader Hails Chinese Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former head of state
chief Earnest Shonekan today congratulated the Chinese leaders
for the rapid economic growth China has achieved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Shonekan said he would like to
congratulate the Chinese leaders for the vision they have "to see
things ahead and to put appropriate measures in place".
</P>
<P>
According to him, it is the foresight of the Chinese leaders
to liberalize the national economy to some extent, send
businesses to play in the global field, and promote technological
advancement that results in China's fast economic growth which is
"very very exemplary".
</P>
<P>
Shonekan, who visited China last October, is chairman of the
vision 2010 committee, which has been drawing Nigeria's first
national long-term socio-economic development blueprint since
November last year.
</P>
<P>
The way by which China scores the rapid development in such a
short time "needs to be copied by all countries", because no
country has ever made such achievements in a single stretch, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Shonekan, who called himself businessman instead of
politician, made these remarks prior to the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) scheduled to open
the coming Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the forthcoming CPC congress is expected to
make decisions on further implementing China's socio-economic
development program so as to steadily push the reforms forward in
the country.
</P>
<P>
As for the reform policies and measures China has been
carrying out these years, Shonekan said: "This is one of the
things I think you should continue."
</P>
<P>
Further reform will help China attract more foreign investment
and boost the transfer of Chinese funds and technology overseas,
especially to developing countries, and Africa in particular,
thus having an impact on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
It will also improve the competitiveness of Chinese
enterprises in the global market, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran called today on the
European Union (EU) to reconsider its decision to suspend
importing pistachio from Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here today, the Iranian Ministry of
Agriculture called EU's decision "hasty" and said the Iranian
pistachio is "toxin-free."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the government supervises the
mechanized process of pistachio's harvest and production through
tight quality control and laboratory methods to ensure that the
products meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
The EU said Tuesday that it had banned imports of pistachio
from Iran because of fears of contamination by Aflatoxin B1, a
carcinogenic substance produced by molds.
</P>
<P>
The EU imported from Iran 83,700 tonnes of pistachio worth 14
million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by Iran's Ministry of Agriculture in 1995 shows
that 59 percent of world's pistachio is produced in Iran. It
harvests about 210,000 tonnes of pistachio annually, half of which
is exported, earning 400 million dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Angola's Opposition UNITA Strives to Avoid UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is sparing no effort
to implement the Lusaka peace accord before the UN's decision of
imposing sanctions on it takes effect on September 30.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today by special envoy of the United
Nations to Angola Blondin Beye when addressing diplomatic
missions based in Angola on the development of its peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the UNITA has many difficulties in
meeting all the provisions of the peace agreement before the UN
Security Council's resolution on sanctions against UNITA comes
into force.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the UN's sanctions, first of all, the UNITA has to
allow the government of national unity to reestablish local
government organs in the areas under its control, such as
Bailundo, Andulo, Kuango and Mavinga, which are of great
strategic importance to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
This is a serious challenge to UNITA, said Beye.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA also has to completely disarm its troops, which is
worried by international community, according to the UN envoy.
</P>
<P>
As for the status of the UNITA controlled radio, Beye said
that much progress has been made, adding that the radio's hostile
propaganda have reduced drastically.
</P>
<P>
But it is not easy to solve all the three outstanding problems
within twenty days, the UN official stressed.

ZKA has found that German firms have mainly exported to Iran
products that could be used for both civilian and military
purposes, while in some cases, however, components clearly
designed for the manufacture of arms.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel's closure has caused
more economic losses to the Palestinian people and Palestinian
businessmen urged Israel to end the closure as soon as possible,
JMCC, an East Jerusalem-based Palestinian news center reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement from the Ministry of Agriculture
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) as saying that daily
losses of the agricultural sector in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
reached 630,000 U.S. dollars due to the closure.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the West Bank can not market their agricultural
products and those farmers who borrowed loans could not pay back
the money due to the losses of income, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business sector in the West Bank city of Nablus
also experienced huge losses due to the closure, JMCC said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 4,000 business organizations and institutions
registered with the local chamber of commerce have stopped their
operations. Factories in the city are unable to get raw materials
and thousands of workers can not go to work while doctors and
nurses and health workers can not reach their working places
because of the closure, according to JMCC.
</P>
<P>
The businessmen in the city voiced their concern over the
closure and urged international community to pressure Israel to
end the closure as soon as possible, JMCC added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hamas Spokesman Arrested for Endangering Jordan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said today the reason
for arresting the Amman-based Hamas spokesman is that he had made
statements undermining the Kingdoms national security.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time Jordan has made public the charge on
Ibrahim Ghosheh who was arrested on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason of the arrest, Jordanian Minister of
State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawe said Ghosheh was
detained for questioning 24 hours after he had given Reuters
Television a statement saying that the "armed struggle against
Israel will continue...as long as the detention of Palestinian
prisoners continue."
</P>
<P>
Mutawe was quoted in Radio Jordan as denying the Monday
accusation by Jordan's opposition parties that the detention "is a
response to American pressure calling to combat terrorism as the
(U.S.) Secretary of State (Madeleine Albright) starts her visit to
the region."
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old, Jerusalem-born Ghosheh is one of the founders
of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Palestine, a member of the
politburo of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas and the Hamas
spokesman in Amman.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested following two suicide bombing incidents in
Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4, killing a total of 22
people. The Izzedin Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas
has claimed responsibility for both. Israel has pressured the
Palestinian side to crack down on terrorism
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel's
occupation of Palestine, but the Izzedin Qassam Brigades were
formed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a major player in the peace process and having a peace
treaty with the Jewish state, has denounced the bombings.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
announced the approval of 531.5 million U.S. dollars in financing
for the coal sector rehabilitation project in India.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the project are to back the
market-oriented reforms in the country's coal sector and,
especially, to provide financial and technical support to Coal
India, which is the largest public sector enterprise in the
country and one of the world's largest coal companies in terms of
production, in its efforts to become commercially viable and
self-sustaining.
</P>
<P>
The project is also aimed to increase domestic supplies of coal
by financing investment in 24 of its most profitable open-cast
mines of Coal India until imports and production from private
investment can fill the emerging supply gap.
</P>
<P>
The financing consists of a 530 million dollar loan and a 1.5
million credit channeled through the International Development
Association, the World Bank's concessionary lending arm for
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> UN: No Cut in Palestinian Refugee Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) today announced that it had abandoned its
planned budget cut of 20 million U.S. dollars after several
consecutive days of Palestinian refugees' protests in Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Lionel Brisson, director of UNRWA
in Lebanon, following a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri here, according to Lebanese official National News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the donor nations to UNRWA, the sole
provider of social welfare to the 3.3 million Palestinian refugees
in the world, held a meeting today in Jordan's capital of
Amman. They agreed to cover 19 million U.S. dollars out of the 20
million U.S. dollars deficit in the organization's overall budget,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Another 1 million U.S. dollars must also be raised, he added,
hoping the matter should be settled down in this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the organization had given up all its
spending-saving measures it had announced before, especially in
health care and education services.
</P>
<P>
The new budget for next year will be discussed in the UN's
General Assembly, he added.
</P>
<P>
On August 25, Brisson delivered a letter to Lebanese Foreign
Minister Fares Boueiz informing him of the reduction of 20 million
U.S. dollars in this year's budget of 54.7 million U.S. dollars
due to the lack of contributions from donor countries.
</P>
<P>
The decision provoked several days of protests by Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon and other host countries.

<HEADLINE> FBI Tries to Minimize Damage to Saudi Bombing Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The FBI director tried on
Wednesday to minimize the damage to the probe into the 1996 truck
bombing in Saudi Arabia after the Justice Department decided to
drop the charge against a Saudi suspect who was believed to have
link to the attack.
</P>
<P>
Louis Freeh said the FBI would have preferred that Hani
al-Sayegh, the Saudi suspect brought from Canada by the United
States, had followed through on an earlier plea agreement to admit
his guilt to an unrelated terrorist charge and to help U.S.
investigators make a probe into the Khobar Towers truck bombing
under the condition that he would not be extradited to Saudi
Arabia, his home country.
</P>
<P>
But according to a statement issued on Monday by the Justice
Department, Sayegh had not provided the requisite evidence, and
prosecution against him had to be "withdrawn."
</P>
<P>
The failure to draw any evidence on the Khobar Towers bombing,
which killed 19 American servicemen, from Sayegh was a blow to the
FBI investigators, but Freeh told a briefing they would "work that
case with every resource and with the greatest intensity possible"
to minimize the damage, caused by Sayegh's "reneging on that
agreement."
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to do whatever we need to do for as long
as it takes to bring a charge and prosecution against those
responsible" for the bombing, he said. Freeh said the FBI
continues to work closely with Saudi Arabia to acquire evidence
about the bombing. But the FBI has not been able to directly
question any suspect in Saudi Arabia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the FBI had evidence linking Sayegh to the bombing
attack, Freeh said: "We have received a lot of information from
our counterparts." But he said some of the evidence would be
inadmissible in U.S. court for a criminal prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Warns of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Meeting with United States
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright late today, Israeli
opposition Labor party leader Ehud Barak warned that the current
crisis in the Israeli-Arab peace process could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held after his 50-minute meeting
with Albright, Barak said that the meeting focused on the issue of
fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Barak, the hawkish former Army Chief of Staff voiced his full
support to the Likud government in demanding Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) to launch a war against Islamic militant
organizations, such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and
Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing
attacks in Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4, that killed 25
people and wounded over 300 others and have aggravated the crisis
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Barak pointed out that the major difference between his
party and the Likud government was that his party regarded
political negotiations as the only way to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said he favored a temporary halt to the construction of the
Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem, which sparked the current
peace stalemate, in order to rebuild confidence between Israel
and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Barak warned that the continued deterioration of the situation
in the peace process would lead to war. He said this was
unnecessary and thus should be prevented through making efforts to
resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He added that he and Albright also discussed the tensions in
South Lebanon, where 13 Israeli soldiers were killed in clashes
with anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrilla forces last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he was opposed to the unilateral Israeli pullout from
south Lebanon. He demanded international peacekeepers or Lebanese
forces be deployed to replace the Israeli troops stationed there
since 1985 to maintain its self-claimed south Lebanon security
zone.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he also requested Albright's help in securing the
release of Israeli citizen Azzam Azzam, who was sentenced to 15
years in prison on August 31 by an Egyptian court for spying for
Israel. He strongly denied that Azzam was a spy.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her first Middle East tour since taking office, is
scheduled to visit Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia after
holding rounds of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders here.

<HEADLINE> UNRWA Revokes Cuts in Services for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Relief and
Work Agency (UNRWA) decided today to revoke some planned
cuts in services for millions of Palestinian refugees in the
region after winning pledges of fresh fundings.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA Commissioner-General Peter Hansen said at a press
conference here that he was able to revoke the cuts after winning
over 22 million U.S. dollars in new pledges from the agency's 26
donor countries for its regular programs in 1997, Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
His decision followed Tuesday's donors' meeting in Amman,
during which some of the donors pledged to contribute more funds
to offset the agency's 20 million dollars deficit for fiscal
year 1997.
</P>
<P>
Due to the deficit, the UNRWA, which is in charge of helping
some 3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon,
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, planned austerity measures earlier
this year to cut down its regular services.
</P>
<P>
These measures included imposition of tuition fees on school
children, freezing the appointment of teachers and reduction in
hospitalization programs and medical treatment services.
</P>
<P>
The measures triggered off widespread criticism from the Arab
world.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Journalists Urges to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAT ES SALAAM, September 10 (Xinhua)-- Tanzanian journalists
today called on all countrymen, irrespective of their religious
beliefs, political affiliations and cultural norms, to unite to
fight the disease of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day workshop for heads of mass media on
HIV/AIDS in the Tanzanian capital, the journalists noted that
there should be a consistence and uniformity on messages and
speeches being made on ways to prevent further spread of the
fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
There are three weapons against AIDS, namely, to abstain from
sex, have one regular sexual partner or use condom, according to
the National AIDS Control Program (NACP).
</P>
<P>
Participants of the workshop observed that contradicting
statements among sections of the society who want to safeguard
their interests have placed people in cross roads, hence stalling
efforts being made to save mankind from the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is said to be leading in Africa with high number of
HIV/AIDS victims. As of last December, there were 88,667 reported
cases in the country, the number which the NACP estimates to
represent only 20 percent of the real number.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ex-president Kaunda to Be Sued for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambian ex-president Kenneth
Kaunda is to be sued for alleging that two officers in the Office
of President had tried to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
The official Zambia News Agency ZANA today quoted Kafumba
Mboma, lawyer for the affected officers Max Kaona and Lameck
Malambo, as saying that his firm is going ahead to sue Kaunda for
libel since the ex-president refused to apologize to his clients
for linking them to an assassination plot.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the two officers set a deadline last Thursday for
Kaunda, president of the United National Independence Party
(UNIP), to offer an apology within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year old former president, who led Zambia to
Independence from Britain in 1964 and ruled the country until
1991, named the two officers as being among those who allegedly
wanted to assassinate him in a shooting accident late August, in
which he and another opposition leader were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers said that the allegations leveled against their
clients were grave and put them in danger and also demanded
compensation.
</P>
<P>
But a senior official of the UNIP said on Tuesday that the
party saw no reason for Kaunda to apologize because the
allegation was true.
</P>
<P>
Mboma told ZANA that therefore, he and his colleagues will go
ahead in pursuing the case to its "logical" conclusion.

LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The former commander of
Liberia's armed forces General A. D. Kromah today complained
about the favoritism of newly-elected President Charles Taylor in
building the government and restructuring the army.
</P>
<P>
General Kromah said he was seriously worried about the
composition of the cabinet of Taylor's government, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the key positions such as defense minister
and chief of staff are both generals of Taylor's National
Patriotic Party, which won more than 75 percent of the parliament
seats in the elections in July.
</P>
<P>
He described it as "ridiculous" that Taylor had promised to
build a broad-based government but many important positions are
taken by members of his former faction.
</P>
<P>
As for the restructuring of the Liberian armed forces, General
Kromah said the new army should be represented by all ethnic
groups and balanced among all parties concerned.
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the U.S.
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Wednesday urged President
Bill Clinton to support easing sentencing guidelines for low-level
drug offenders and to restore allocation to repair dilapidated
schools.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged to try to roll back what they described as
racist attempts to erode affirmative action programs -- an effort
to provide increased employment and education opportunities for
ethnic minorities and women, to over come past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
They said their primary goals are to eradicate drugs from black
communities and to promote education as the lodestone for a
successful life.
</P>
<P>
Preparing an agenda for the 105th Congress, Representative
Maxine Waters, a Democrat of California, said that black leaders
face a difficult task in the Republican-controlled House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
Waters, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, spoke at
a news conference to mark the opening of the Black Caucus
Foundation's annual legislative conference.
</P>
<P>
She said a continuing source of irritation is the disparity of
the mandatory sentences meted out to mainly black people found in
possession of small amounts of crack cocaine and the far lighter
sentences often given to mainly white people found to possess
similar amounts of powdered cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Waters called is "totally unfair."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to continue to impress on the president to do the
right thing," she said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Waters said money is desperately needed to
repair dilapidated schools and to provide them with up-to-date
science and computer facilities.
</P>
<P>
She said the "measly five billion dollars" earmarked for that
effort got lost in budget negotiations between Clinton and
congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
"We want that money back," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Collectively, we can get some wins if we stop thinking of
ourselves as victims," she said.

PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned "with

COLOMBO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan engineering

As far as business is concerned, it goes on as usual."

<HEADLINE> French TV to Put on Movie on Post-War German POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A French television channel
will put a documentary Friday on the history of 1 million German
prisoners of war (POW) who were detained in French concentration
camps from 1945 to 1948, according to le Monde today.
</P>
<P>
These former soldiers of the Wehrmacht were subjected to
inhumane treatment, dangerous labor and constant threat of death,
and 23,000 of them died during the detention, according to the
daily.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "One Million Germans in France," the film was shot by
Stephane Khemis and Jean-Michel Gaillard and produced by
Henry-Claude de la Casiniere for the "Documents of History" serial
program of France 3 television channel.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the war, the Allied forces had captured about 10
million German POWs, and 1 million of them were imprisoned in
France.
</P>
<P>
Some survivors of the POWs said in the documentary that
although the Geneva Convention provisions require clean shacks for
POWs, distriction of food at a correct ration and sparing POWs
from dangerous labor, their experience in the camps was far from
that.
</P>
<P>
Walter Miksh, a former warrant officer of Luftwaffe, said that
he received "minimum food" and was subjected to "brutal treatment"
by the guard. Willi Lidle, a former SS soldier, said that the
French guards urinated upon the POWs in the truck cabins which
transported them.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 3,000 German POWs were killed when defusing land
mines in France, said Raymond Aubrac, a famous French resistance
fighter who was in charge of the operation of defusing land mines
in the whole country, in his book "Where the Memory Comes Late."
</P>
<P>
It was only after a campaign by the Catholic press of France
that the French government began to improve the treatment of the
German POWs in 1947, said le Monde.

<HEADLINE> More Investment in Central, Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's new investment
policies have been accepted by Chinese and foreign investors, and
helped bring in more overseas capital for the country's
central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing '97 China Investment and Trade Talks here,
investors from various countries and regions showed great interest
in more than 10,000 projects, put up for negotiations by 26
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China.
</P>
<P>
The central and western provinces and regions, such as
Xinjiang, Qinghai and Shaanxi, also presented their own projects,
covering farming, animal husbandry, hi-tech and light industry.
</P>
<P>
There are rich natural and agricultural resources in those
areas, said Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Some provinces in central and western China, such as Shaanxi,
have many science and technology institutes and experts,
indicating great development potential.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more investment in the central and western areas,
China has issued a series of preferential policies, including a
transfer payment plan.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also increased loans to those areas.
According to Sun, about 60 percent of foreign loans have been
granted to central and western China in recent years. Priority is
given to projects concerning transportation, energy and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, China has widened the market in that region,
especially to investment projects which will fully use its local
resource and labor advantages.
</P>
<P>
Those projects, which are limited in eastern China, can be
developed freely in central and western China, and products made
in that region can be sold locally without limits.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, China's central and western areas share only 10
percent of the total investment in China, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In order to narrow the investment gap between eastern and
central and western areas, more needs to be done to improve
the investment environment in those places.

<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today reshuffled his cabinet immediately after his
re-election as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP).
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto appointed Kanezo Muraoka as cabinet secretary to
replace Seiroku Kajiyama; former Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo
Obuchi as foreign minister to succeed Yukihiko Ikeda; and Mitsuo
Horiuchi as minister of international trade and industry to
replace Shiji Sato.
</P>
<P>
But he retained three key ministers: Finance Minister Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, Defense Agency Chief Fumio Kyuma, and Health and
Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
</P>
<P>
In a controversial move, the key cabinet post for Hashimoto's
reform programs, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency,
went to Koko Sato, who was convicted of accepting bribes in the
1970s Lockheed payoff scandal.
</P>
<P>
At a nationally televised press conference where the new
cabinet was introduced, newly named Chief Cabinet Secretary
Muraoka defended Sato's appointment, and said the main task of the
new cabinet is to implement the reforms pledged by Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
"The case is over legally and he has long years of experience
as a Diet(parliament) member," he said, citing Sato's experience
in having served as head of the LDP's task force on administrative
reforms.
</P>
<P>
In May 1986, The Tokyo High Court gave Sato a two-year prison
term with a three-year suspension for taking 2 million yen in
bribes from All Nippon Airways in 1972 while serving as vice
transport minister.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also named Ihei Ochi, a former transport minister, as
minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries; Nobutaka
Machimura as education minister; Kokichi Shimoinaba as justice
minister; Hiroshi Oki as Environment Agency Chief; and Muneo
Suzuki as Chief of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development agencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Koichi Kato retained his post as LDP secretary
general along with LDP Policy Affairs Research Council Chairman
Taku Yamasaki and LDP Executive Council Chairman Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Hashimoto's re-election as LDP
president was formally endorsed at a plenary session of LDP
members from both houses of the Diet.

cultural backgrounds and social systems, both of them are nations
with multi-ethnic groups.

MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government today
called on Chechnya to officially repudiate a statement issued by
Chechen Prime Minister Vakha Arsanov against the federal
leadership before the next round of talks between Russia and
Chechnya begin, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Russian government said it would deepen and
continue the Chechnya peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in response to Russia's move to institute criminal
proceedings against a public execution in Chechnya, Arsanov said
Grozny would file a criminal case against Russia for unleashing
war in the breakaway republic, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Arsanov said that Russian leaders should be lined up before a
firing squad just as done with two criminals in central Grozny on
September 3.
</P>
<P>
Moscow said, "It is difficult to establish relations when one
party talks peace and the other -- revenge."
</P>
<P>
Russian government spokesman Igor Shabdurasulov said that the
federal authorities are well aware that "there are certain forces
in Grozny and Moscow that are not interested in a quick
settlement."
</P>
<P>
Shabdurasulov said each time a major accord between Grozny and
Moscow attempts to be more precise on the agreement to transport
Caspian oil via Chechnya, provocative statements or acts are made
immediately to upset relations between the two.
</P>
<P>
On September 9, Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Nestsov and head of the Southern Oil Company (Yuko) Khozh-Akhmet
Yarikhanov signed the Caspian oil transportation agreement.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress Spokesman Gives First Press Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) is a major event which people
all over the country have been following with close attention,
said Party congress spokesman Xu Guangchun in his first press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The congress, scheduled to open tomorrow, was expected to
deepen political restructuring and make a new breakthrough in
economic restructuring, Xu said at the conference attended
by over 600 Chinese and overseas reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earnest efforts were urged to promote the socialist ethic and
cultural progress, Xu said when asked about what the Chinese
people are expecting from the congress.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on the shareholding system by a Hong
Kong reporter, Xu said that the system should not be simply
labeled as "privatization." "This is entirely a misunderstanding.
The key lies in who controls the shares," Xu added, saying that
the system is a form of capital organization.
</P>
<P>
Xu expressed his belief that the experience of state-owned
businesses over the past years will be summed up at the congress,
and new decisions will be made, opening up a new situation for the
reform and development of the state businesses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the political restructuring, Xu said much has been
achieved in this regard since the convening of the 14th National
Party Congress, and added that the political restructuring is sure
to continue along with the deepening of the economic restructuring
and the cross-century development in the country's socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the building of socialist democracy is our firm
goal."
</P>
<P>
On fighting corruption, Xu said that the fight against corruption
is a long-term task which needs persistent efforts, owing to the
"complicated nature of corruption."
</P>
<P>
"Intensifying our democratic supervision is a key measure to
overcome corruption, and we will never simply copy Western
political system," Xu stressed.
</P>
<P>
The press conference lasted for about an hour.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Calm, Unity Among Filipinos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today called on all sectors for calm and unity in the midst
of the current currency crisis and the raging debate over
constitutional change in the country.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Europe and the Middle East, Ramos said in a
statement that "the stormy weather" over the country will soon
blow over, and the nation will continue on its course to economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In mentioning "stormy weather", Ramos was referring to the
ongoing debate over the proposed amendments to the constitution,
the currency crisis and the volatile stock market, said a press
release from the Presidential Press Office.
</P>
<P>
In this impromptu statement, Ramos appealed to his critics to
strengthen "the ship" which 70 million Filipinos are on board,
instead of putting holes on it.
</P>
<P>
Ramos accused some "heavyweights" among his critics of "seeing
certain opportunities for themselves in the current problems
besetting the country."
</P>
<P>
Ramos again called on his critics -- the opposition and the
Roman Catholic Church -- to be patient to wait till early November
when his ruling Lakas-NUCD party will reveal stance on some
"political issues."
</P>
<P>
Ramos' statement came just ten days before the opposition and
the powerful Catholic Church stage a massive rally in central
Manila to protest the drive to rewrite the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago, one of the
prominent opposition leaders in the country, agreed to unite with
her rivals in the opposition camp against changes to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Santiago said she will join the September 21 rally along with
the United Opposition led by Vice President Joseph Estrada,
Senator Edgardo Angara and Senate President Ernesto Maceda.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders and Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin
have accused Ramos of supporting the charter change drive in order
to run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos must step down in June 1998 when his constitutionally
mandated one single six-year term expires.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who is now in Russia, will return home one day before
the protest rally. He will also visit Kuwait, the Czech Republic
and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Because of mounting concerns over political stability in the
country, both the local currency market and the stock market
witnessed turmoil today.
</P>
<P>
The average exchange rate between the Philippine peso and the
U.S. dollar today dropped further to 32.375 pesos to one dollar
from 31.947 pesos Wednesday. In the stock market, the main index
plunged 67.48 points to close at 2,145.29.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues near Afghanistan's Northern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting was
continuing today between Afghan Islamic Taliban fighters and their
rival forces for the control of Mazar-e-Sharif, the second largest
city in northern Afghanistan, Afghan sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces, which are now reportedly a few kilometers
away of the stronghold of anti-Taliban strongman Uzbek warlord
Abdul Malik, have flown in fresh reinforcements in preparations
for a final assault on the city, about 300 km north of Kabul, said
the sources in Peshawar, a major city in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic student militia have asked the rival forces
defending Mazar-e-Sharif to lay down their arms, otherwise a major
offensive will be launched against them, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to foreign aid workers in Mazar-e-Sharif, fierce
fighting was raging in the eastern parts of the city and situation
for the anti-Taliban forces was alarming as some defected
commanders were in control of all the western roads leading to the
city, they said.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to Malik and his allies, Shiite group
Hezb-e-Wadhat and Harakat-e-Islami, have launched a series of
counter-attacks on Taliban to secure their control of
Mazar-e-Sharif amid incidents of looting in the city, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malik's another ally, Afghanistan's former military
chief Ahmad Masood launched a major attack on Taliban positions in
eastern Takhar Province, according to another report monitored
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Masood, whose forces are within 20 km north of Taliban
controlled capital of Kabul, has been battling the hard-line
militia there for the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who took control of Mazar-e-Sharif late May after
turning against his former boss Rashid Dostum, briefly sided with
Taliban, allowing them into northern Afghanistan unopposed. But
only after five days, in a dispute over power-sharing, he drove
the Islamic militia out again.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control about two-thirds of Afghanistan's
territory and the capital of Kabul, have vowed to impose a strict
Islamic rule in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Honest Australian Mother Showered With Rewards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A single Australian mother,
who accepted a 50 Australian dollar (36 U.S. dollar) reward for
returning a 75,000 Australian dollar (54,750 U.S. dollar) prize
winning lottery ticket, was today showered with gifts from
well-wishing strangers for her honesty.
</P>
<P>
Alison Bridger, 25, who found the winning lotto scratch card in
a rubbish bin while working her part-time job as a Perth service
station attendant, was the topic of heated talk-back radio debate
today in Perth, a coastal city in Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the Gull Service Station where Bridger works every
Friday were contacted throughout today by strangers offering
cheque donations, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Bridger, a mother of a two and a half year-old child, said she
appreciated the gifts but did not understand the motivation.
</P>
<P>
"Sure I thought about keeping it but it wasn't mine," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have been able to live with myself if I kept it so
it was an easy decision to give it back."
</P>
<P>
She said she had been offered a 100 Australian dollar (73 U.S.
dollar) reward from the winner but had only accepted 50 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The unspecified winner, however, was not the only lucky person
in Perth.
</P>
<P>
 The honesty of staff at a Perth petrol station saved an
absent-minded father from missing out on a 54,750 U.S. dollar
fathers' day windfall, The West Australian Lotteries Commission
was quoted by AAP as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A local newsagent confirmed on Monday the two Australian
dollar (1.4 U.S. dollar) scratchy the 82-year-old man's son had
given him for father's day was a winner.
</P>
<P>
But when he arrived at the Lotteries Commission to collect his
prize, the man realized the ticket, which he had been using as a
bookmark in a street directory, was missing.
</P>
<P>
A panic-stricken search ensued, including calls to the
newsagent and other places the man had stopped to ask directions.
</P>
<P>
Later that day, the man's daughter received a phone call from
a Gull Service Station in Perth, to say the ticket had been found.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fund Managers Confident of Malaysia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign fund managers
have expressed their confidence that Malaysia's fundamentals are
still intact and that there is no cause for concern, Malaysian
government's economic adviser Tun Daim Zainuddin said today.
</P>
<P>
Daim, who met with several fund managers last week, said, "We
will continue to meet them and have so far cleared their doubts
about the country's current account deficit and the so-called mega
projects."
</P>
<P>
"They now understand and we will continue to listen to the
voice of the business community," he was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as saying after launching "Malaysia
Today", a publication by Malaysia's Asian Strategy and Leadership
Institute (ASLI).
</P>
<P>
Daim said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will be meeting with
several fund managers this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is scheduled to
attend a dialogue with fund managers here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also finance minister, announced several measures
aimed at easing inflationary pressures and reducing the current
account deficit last night at a dinner hosted by the Association
of Banks in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The measures included a two percent cut in government
expenditure, deferment of decisions on privatization of
government projects and a review of large purchases of foreign
goods by government agencies including the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Misinformation has led to confusion about the state of the
economy, Daim said, adding that as Malaysia continues to reach
greater economic height and play a pivotal role in the
international scene, genuine interest and the search for accurate
information about Malaysia becomes more complex and varied.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the present currency crisis and the decline in
the stock market will not lead Malaysia into a recession, saying
that economic fundamentals remain strong.
</P>
<P>
The present situation is of a transient nature, he said. "What
is important is that we should not lose confidence of the present
system and take a long term view of the economy."

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 11 (xinhua) -- State radio in Sierra Leone
said today that three Sierra Leone security officers were
detained by the Guinean government authorities Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leone military government information division was
quoted by the radio as saying that the three, Colonel Komba
Mondeh, Major Fangay Turay and a paramilitary Corporal were
allegedly "involved in clandestine activities that threatens the
security of the two sister republics of Guinea and Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
The radio did not specify the nature of the investigations but
said the military government is "assuring the public that all
subversive activities aimed at derailing peace and stability in
Sierra Leone will be nipped in the bud."
</P>
<P>
The radio also announced that a truckload of arms and
ammunition allegedly purchased by two former ministers in the
ousted civilian government of Tejan Kabbah, has been intercepted
by Ghanaian troops in the west African peace-keeping force
(Ecomog) in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The two have been identified as former Mineral Resources
Minister Dr Prince Harding and former deputy Defense Minister
Hinga Norman.
</P>
<P>
"The arms were intercepted on Wednesday by Ghanaian troops
acting on a tip-off, seizing the truck which was on its way to
the border town of Zimmi (in the east of Sierra Leone)," the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
The radio accused Nigerian troops in Ecomog of "training and
equipping Kamajor militiamen" to destabilize Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It said the ammunition were purchased through the
collaboration of the Ecomog Field Commander, General Victor Malu.
But the Ecomog Ground Commander in Sierra Leone, Colonel Max
Khobe has denied the allegation.

<HEADLINE> UN Concerned About Renewed Fighting in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
expressed deep concern over recent renewed fighting in northern
Afghanistan and appealed to Afghan warring parties for an
immediate ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is "deeply disturbed" by the renewed
fighting in northern Afghanistan, which is posing an additional
threat to the very territorial unity of the country itself, said
Norbert Holl, head of the U.N. Special Mission to Afghanistan, in
a press release issued here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The continuing armed struggle in Afghanistan is also splitting
the Afghan people along ethnic, religious and regional lines, he
said. "This makes the goal of national reconciliation and peace
yet more elusive and difficult to achieve."
</P>
<P>
Holl also reiterated that the route to stability and peace in
Afghanistan is through ceasefire and negotiations among the
warring factions in the spirit of tolerance and mutual
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy renewed his strong appeal to the Afghan
warring parties to stop fighting immediately and to accept the
long-standing invitation of the U.N. for serious intra-Afghan
dialogue to resolve the national crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It is never too late to begin these negotiations through the
good offices of the United Nations," he said.

<HEADLINE> America's Cup Destroyer Jailed for 34 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A New Zealand court on
Thursday jailed for 34 months a Maori rights protester who
flattened the America's Cup, the world's oldest sporting trophy,
with a sledge-hammer.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here, Benjamin Peri Nathan, 28, attacked
the trophy at the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron headquarters in
Auckland on March 14. New Zealand won the trophy in 1995 in one of
the country's greatest sporting moments.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a jury found him guilty of wilful damage
and in the Auckland District Court Judge Barry Morris sentenced
Nathan to two years and 10 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
The sentence will be served in addition to an 18-month prison
term Nathan is already serving for aggravated robbery and
demanding with menace.
</P>
<P>
Nathan had no regrets about the attack except to apologise for
frightening those in the room who watched him belt the case and
the cup up to 50 times with a short-handled sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he took into account that Nathan had a 12-year
history of appearing before the courts, which included 16 past
convictions.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Making Money in Xodoin Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Early in the morning, Mima
Zholma and Basang Zholma carry their goods to Norbu Lingka, a park
in Lhasa, capital of Tibet, to do a little business during the
Xodoin Festival.
</P>
<P>
Xodoin was a traditional Tibetan drama festival that was
celebrated by displays of Buddhas and staging Tibetan dramas. In
the past it was mainly religious, and Norbu Lingka was the
entertainment capital of Tibetan aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the festival has begun to change into a trade
fair and Norbu Lingka has become a marketplace.
</P>
<P>
"In the past I came here merely for entertainment. But when I
see thousands of people crowding into Norbu Lingka, I know that
it's a good opportunity to make money," Mima Zholma says.
</P>
<P>
The sisters Zholma sold out their beer, mineral water, and
cigarettes, getting about 300 yuan (36 US dollars), in no more
than five hours.
</P>
<P>
Along the two-mile Norbu Lingka wall, tourists encounter
more than 1,000 booths and salesmen busily hawking their
goods. One old man is crying out to a visitor, "Come on buy a
bottle, it's home-made!" meaning his special highland barley
spirits.
</P>
<P>
The same scene is repeated in front of the Potala, and at the
foot of Zhebung Temple there are stands selling buttered tea to
pilgrims and tourists.
</P>
<P>
"Even the harsh natural conditions can't keep the booming
business down," one tourist said.

<HEADLINE> East Asia Can Overcome Financial Turbulence: WB Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- East Asia is well
positioned to overcome the current financial turbulence as long as
it enhances regulatory framework of financial system while
deepening structural reforms, according to a World Bank study
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The study, entitled "Are Financial Sector Weaknesses
Undermining the East Asian Miracle?", stresses that the region's
economies boast strong fundamentals, experienced macroeconomic
management, high savings and investment, and close integration
with the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Javad Shirazi, regional manager for strategy and partnerships
of the World Bank, is of the view that the region would continue
its dynamic growth despite the recent currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He told a press briefing here today: "There is every reason to
believe that, if macroeconomic and financial management is prudent
and countries adopt the structural measures needed to enhance the
competitiveness of their economies, East Asia will be able to ride
out the inevitable bumps on the road to a promising new century."
</P>
<P>
The study finds that even though East Asia has been the region
of "miracles" with world's fastest GDP growth for a decade, it is
not immune to short-term setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Stijn Claessens, World Bank principal economist in East Asia
and the Pacific and co-author of the study, pointed out that
although economies in the region have the fundamentals right, some
weak points do exist, notably large current account deficit,
excessive lending to property development and consumer credit,
non-performing loans and bad assets on banks' books, and weak
supervisory framework.
</P>
<P>
Currently, banking has dominated East Asia's financial sector,
but other parts of the financial systems, such as fixed income
market, equity market and pension funds, need further
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He continued: "The penalties for maintaining a fragile,
under-developed financial system are severe, and the time to
correct structural weakness is much more compressed."
</P>
<P>
The study notes that robust and efficient financial systems
will only be achieved if countries adopt a consistent set of
reinforcing actions.
</P>
<P>
It recommends that East Asian countries need to redouble
efforts to strengthen institutional and incentive framework for
the financial system, including sound supervision and effective
mechanism to address bank failures.
</P>
<P>
The study also suggests gradual liberalization of financial
systems in East Asian countries. Internationalization of financial
services is of regional importance as foreign financial firms can
bring both competition and international standards and practice.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Investment
Funds Association (HKIFA) will host the 11th International
Investment Funds Conference in October, it was announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Peter Lord, the newly-appointed
 HKIFA chairman, said this conference will bring together industry
 leaders from about 30 countries to discuss industry developments
and matters of common interest.
</P>
<P>
After three days in Hong Kong, the delegates will travel to
Beijing where China's central bank, the People's Bank of China,
will co-host another day of meetings.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first occasion that the conference is to be held
in Asia outside Japan, and is a recognition of the growth,
maturity and importance of the Hong Kong fund management
industry," said Lord, who is also managing director of LGT Asset
Management Ltd.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that currently more than 100 billion
U.S. dollars is managed by HKIFA member companies in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Lord said that in the coming year, a number of initiatives will
 be undertaken on the educational front, targeting both at
industry participants and at the general public.
</P>
<P>
For industry participants, HKIFA endeavors to increase the
depth and scope of the pensions and unit trust training courses.
</P>
<P>
These programs aim at enabling existing and potential industry
participants to have a thorough understanding of the operation of
the industry, with the ultimate objective of further boosting the
professional standards of the industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to organizing training for industry participants in
 Hong Kong, the HKIFA also runs programs for Chinese mainland
regulators.
</P>
<P>
"We note that a top priority for the mainland authorities is to
 establish the regulatory framework for the fund industry and we
hope that we can, through this training, facilitate this process
by sharing with them our international experience and expertise,"
said Lord.

<HEADLINE> EU Favors ASEM Membership for Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said
today that it is in favor of giving Australia membership of the
Asia-Europe Summit (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission --
the executive agency of the 15-nation union, said that he had "no
doubt whatsoever" that Australia is more than capable to make an
important contribution as a member of ASEM.
</P>
<P>
The senior EU official made this remark at a joint press
conference with visiting Australian deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer after EU and Australia held their 14th round of
ministerial consultations in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that the question of membership will certainly be
raised at the next ASEM summit to be held in London later this
year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Bangkok ASEM summit in March 1996 was the
manifestation of the EU commitment to reinforce its relations with
Asia.
</P>
<P>
ASEM has started a close dialogue between Europe and Asia
across nearly all spheres ranging from politics, economy, culture,
education to science, he said.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique described the annual consultation, the first
since the signing in June of the joint declaration on relations
between EU and Australia, as being held in a friendly and open
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Brittan and Fischer, who also serves as trade minister,
exchanged views on international as well as bilateral relations at
the consultation which touched upon such issues as latest
developments in the World Trade Organization, developments in the
Asia-Pacific region, prospects for the meeting of the framework
convention on climate change to be held this December in Kyodo,
Japan, and scientific and technological cooperation between EU and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The EU and Australia are close economic partners. The EU is
Australia's largest merchandise trading partner and the largest
source of foreign investment in that country.
</P>
<P>
Many European companies have come to see Australia as a vital
bridgehead into markets in the Asia-Pacific region.

ROME, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy's coach Cesare Maldini was
criticized after his team was held to a 0-0 draw with Georgia in

</P>
<P>
On the same night England beat Moldova 4-0 at Wembley, which
lifted England to top European group two, one point clear of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Media criticism of Italy's performance targeted the team's
over-cautious attitude in the first half and the introduction of
second half substitutes such as Filippo Inzaghi and Roberto
Baggio too late in the match.
</P>
<P>
Many commentators felt that Italy's timid first half was the
result of Maldini's pre-match concern about his side's lack of
match fitness but that they also under-estimated Georgia.

<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- People in Scotland began
voting today in a historic referendum that will determine whether
the country can create its own parliament with the power to change
income tax level for the first time in three centuries.
</P>
<P>
Almost four million people are eligible to vote in 32
constituencies, and a majority of those voting will decide whether
the parliament should be created or not.
</P>
<P>
The voting began at 0600 GMT and ends at 2100 GMT. The first
results are expected shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
By 0300 GMT on Friday morning, the result should be decided
since more than 90 percent of the ballots will have been counted.
The final declaration, however, is unlikely until 1530 GMT on
Friday.
</P>
<P>

parliament, probably in May 1999 and would sit for the first time
in Edinburgh in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wales will vote on a more limited degree of home rule a week
from today.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls conducted earlier all showed an overwhelming
majority of voters in Scotland in favor of forming the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The governing Labor Party, the Liberal Democrats and the
pro-independence Scottish National Party have been campaigning for
a new Scottish Parliament with tax-raising powers, while the
opposition Conservative Party has been urging Scots to vote "NO."
</P>
<P>
Scotland was united with England in 1707, but so far it still
retains many of the characteristics of a national state, with its

<HEADLINE> Kohl Sees Potential for 3 Percent GDP Growth for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FRANKFURT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said today he expected Germany's gross domestic product (GDP)
to grow faster than the 2.5 percent the government forecast for
the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure the growth will be near 3 percent," Kohl said
in a speech at the opening ceremony of the Frankfurt international
car show.
</P>
<P>
Although the current GDP growth is driven mainly by exports,
there is a reason for Germans to be optimistic and not just to
complain about weak domestic growth, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the export boom would stimulate
growth in domestic business in many sectors.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's remarks were apparently encouraged by official figures
released by the German Federal Statistics Office Wednesday, which
showed the German economy had grown 2.9 percent in the second
quarter and 2.0 percent in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> High Criminal Rate in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the lull of
factional fighting in the Somali capital, people here feel
insecure, as many are being killed, wounded and abducted by
gunmen in the past 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
A man was killed in north Mogadishu on late Wednesday
afternoon, as bullets hit him in the chest and six others were
wounded when unidentified gunmen opened fire at a car passing
through the crowded business area of Sana.
</P>
<P>
The wounded included three women of which one was a tea-shop
waiter. All of them were rushed to the ICRC-run hospital of
Keysaney.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, only about 300 meters away from the same area,
a Toyota heading for the animal market was attacked by a group of
gunmen who looted the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness, the gunmen had abducted the vehicle
with two elderly men on the front seat. No casualties were
reported in this incident. However, the fate of the two men
remained unknown as the gunmen drove the Toyota away to the
north.
</P>
<P>
Also in north Mogadishu, a group of heavily armed men attacked
the Yaqshid intermediate school. The neighbors of the school told
reporters that the gunmen attacked the premises with the
intention of robbing its furniture.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers from the neighborhood had fired at the raiders,
foiling their attempt of looting.
</P>
<P>
In south Mogadishu, too, a number of gunmen raided the house
of the director of Green Hope, a local non-governmental
organization. The owner of the house, Mr Jilal Barrow, was
seriously wounded in the head in the course of shooting.
</P>
<P>
As the gunmen couldn't find the target man, they grabbed the
son of Mr Barrow, a seven year old boy who still remains missing.
</P>
<P>
According to the neighbors, the gunmen are likely to ask for
ransom in an exchange of the safe release of the boy. this is not
the first time the Green Hope residence was attacked.
</P>
<P>
The increasing insecurity in the divided capital has also
attracted the attention of the faction leaders. The paralyzed
Islamic courts of north Mogadishu just two days ago sentenced 12
young men for three months imprisonment each for their so-called
misbehavior. The court has warned the militiamen against their
evil conducts.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, south Mogadishu faction leader, Hussein Mohamed
Aidid has summoned his newly formed committee in a bid to disarm
militiamen in south Mogadishu. But so far, no concrete action has
either been taken by Ali Mahdi or Hussein Aidid over the security
situation in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Defense Minister Holds Talks With Ghanaian Guest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of
the Chinese Central Military Commission and defense minister, held
talks with Kojo Tsikata, national security advisor and member of
the Council of the State of Ghana, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor, welcomed Tsikata and his party to
China on the eve of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
He said this historic congress will be held at the crucial time
when China's reform, opening-up and modernization drive comes to a
crucial juncture connecting the past with the future.
</P>
<P>
The friendship between China and Ghana has a long history. In
recent years, the two countries have conducted effective
cooperation in all fields such as politics, economy, military and
culture. They also share common grounds on many major
international issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Tsikata's visit will increase
mutual understanding and promote friendly cooperation between the
two countries and their armies.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked Tsikata for his country's adherence to the "one
China" stance and its consistent support of China on the issues of
Taiwan, human rights and the accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) for China.
</P>
<P>
Tsikata heartily congratulated the CPC for the coming congress
on behalf of Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings and his people.
</P>
<P>
He said that he feels honored to visit China on the eve of the
congress, which is important not only for the Chinese people, but
also for the people of developing countries, because China's
economic growth serves as a model for other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the two countries and their armies have a
long-standing friendly relationship of cooperation, Tsikata said
he is confident that the visit will push forward these ties.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Wu Quanxu, deputy chief of the General Staff
of the People Liberation Army (PLA), participated in the talks.

<HEADLINE> China's Leading TV Manufacturer Benefits from Reforms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Changhong Electronics
Group, once a debt-ridden TV manufacturer, has become China's
biggest color TV producer and increased its capial 190-fold and
raised annual production capacity to 4.8 million TV sets in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
Ni Runfeng, general manager of the Sichuan company, explains
the economic miracle by pointing to the shareholding system in the
state sector.
</P>
<P>
The rags to riches story runs from 1987, when the group was a
small state-owned factory with fixed assets of 46 million
yuan. However, a decade later, Changhong now possesses 733 million
yuan in fixed assets, putting it first in China's electronics
industry.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the group's color TV output was 15 times the 1987
figure and pre-tax profits were 99 times that year's.
</P>
<P>
Ni is now regarded as one of the most prominent entrepreneurs
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that, like most of China's state-owned large and
medium-sized enterprises, Changhong was on the verge of
bankruptcy, resulting from a personnel surplus, inflexible
management, and a shortage of capital, technology, and brains nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
But, "the shareholding reform saved Changhong from the
dangerous stagnation of the mid-1980s," he recalled. In 1988, the
group issued its first stock, raising 36 million yuan for a
self-designed production line, which helped the company bring its
color TV sets up to the international levels, and raising yearly
production capacity to one million sets.
</P>
<P>
Four years later, Changhong got another 100 million yuan from
stock sales.

<HEADLINE> China's Leading TV Manufacturer Benefits From Reforms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Changhong has maintained its growth since it was listed on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange in March of 1994, with profits greater
than other listed companies for three years running.
</P>
<P>
According to Ni, Changhong has gotten three billion yuan from
stock over the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, it has set up 11 self-designed TV production lines,
expanding annual production capacity by more than four million TV
sets, and it now ranks among the top TV manufacturers in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's traditional state ownership blurred the difference
between the functions of the government and enterprises, resulting
in low efficiency, Ni said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a modern enterprise system with independent
management is badly needed to resuscitate the outmoded state-owned
firms and the shareholding system will be an efficient means of
doing so.
</P>
<P>
Ni said that the shareholding system allows enterprises to make
decisions based on a particular market situation, and will increase
their flexibility.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, there was cutthroat competition in China's color TV
market among Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, Changhong, TCL, and
Congka. Changhong, leading domestic brands in the country-wide
price war, grew into the country's biggest television seller by
grabbing 27 percent of the country's TV market.
</P>
<P>
"The price war has reshaped the country's television market.
It would be impossible for an enterprise to use such violent
action under the planned economy," Ni said. "As an independent
stock-holding company, we fully enjoy planning and management
rights."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Changhong's management publicized their plan to
establish a ten-million-yuan fund for poor university students --
without consulting the board of directors. The move was rejected
by stockholders until it was revised and approved by a meeting of
stockholders. "The event gave us an unforgettable lesson," Ni
said. "Any manager in a stock holding company should abide by the
bounds of the supervisory system."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the group purchased two TV factories in Jilin
and Jiangsu provinces to use as export bases, and is
expected to net five million US dollars in profits next year.
</P>
<P>
It is trying to develop into a multinational firm and has come up
with an ambitious plan to enter "the exclusive international club
of top 500 enterprises" by the beginning of the next century, with
annual output reaching eight million TV sets and sales of 30
billion yuan.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government and
the parties in the country have agreed that the present electoral
system introduced in 1978 should be changed, a high-ranking
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris told a
press conference that the government had proposed a combination of
first-past-the-post system and proportional representation system.
</P>
<P>
This system is to strengthen the relationship between members
of the parliament and their constituents by having individual
electorates in place of the current district level system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, constituents don't know whom to go to
as the MPs represent a district and not an electorate.
</P>
<P>
But the minister added that a specific system is yet to be
arrived at.
</P>
<P>
The number of parliament seats would remain unchanged, Peiris
said.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Appears Healthy, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State
General Sani Abacha appeared in public Wednesday in the capital
Abuja, dousing speculations that he is seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
According to This Day, one of the leading national newspapers,
Abacha arrived at the venue for the 27th yearly Accountants'
Conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria
(ICAN), looking healthy, although he appeared slimmer than usual.
</P>
<P>
He spent one and a half hours at the meeting and took the
salute standing from the very beginning to the end of the event
as usual, without showing any clear sign of illness throughout.
</P>
<P>
His countenance throughout the event was bright as he smiled
while waving to people, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the latest issue of the Lagos-based Tell weekly
claimed that Abacha was "very very ill" due to the development of
liver disease he had suffered for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It is reported the presidency has said "we deny that this
story is correct."
</P>
<P>
Security men on Wednesday visited the home of Arit Igiebor,
Editor-in-Chief of Tell magazine, in Lagos and arrested his wife
at the absence of the man.
</P>
<P>
The women was released following a brief arrest after the
security men promised to come back for her unless she produced
her husband within 24 hours, according to a statement issued by
the deputy editor-in-chief of the weekly.
</P>
<P>
It insisted that the magazine "has a duty to inform its
readers of the state of the country... if the junta has contrary
information on the state of Abacha's health, then it could
present it to the Nigeria people."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Continue Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State
General Sani Abacha has restated the government's commitment to
economic reform, saying the trend is "irreversible".
</P>
<P>
The numerous measures of the government to stabilize the
economy, reduce inflation, encourage savings, stimulate
investment and boost productivity have resulted in a remarkable
3.2 percent growth in the economy, Abacha disclosed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Similar progress has been achieved with the twin problems of
deficit financing and excess money spending in the economy," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Abacha also affirmed that the military administration's
"socio-political transformation program" which will lead to a
democratically-elected government next year was on course.
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks in the capital Abuja at the 27th yearly
Accountants' Conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
His public appearance, which followed a report Monday that he
was seriously ill, is observed as something to douse speculations
of his health.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's words were echoed in the keynote speech at the
meeting delivered by Finance Minister chief Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
According to Ani, the government has put in place a number of
policy measures to integrate the Nigerian economy into the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
The measures aimed at opening up the national economy include
policies to enhance increased production, substantial output
growth and employment, as well as to encourage export and ensure
stable and efficient socio-economic environment.
</P>
<P>
They also cover policies to promotement privatization,
commercialization and liberalization of key growth-inducing
ventures.
</P>
<P>
He listed some of the achievements recorded so far, which
include the growth of direct foreign investment from 1,015.7
million U.S. Dollars in 1994 to 1,153.8 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government's fiscal surplus rose from 1.02 billion Naira
(about 12 million Dollars) in 1995 to 37 billion Naira (about 435
million) last year.
</P>
<P>
With a stable exchange rate, the country's gross domestic
product (gdp) went up from 1.3 percent in 1994 to 2.2 and 3.2
percent in the following two years respectively.
</P>
<P>
But he did not forget to warn: "although the 1997 budget
projected a real growth of gdp of 5.5 percent, it may be slightly
lower at the end of the period."
</P>
<P>
Despite these achievements, the tight money policy of the
government has also weakened purchase power of Nigerian
consumers, leading to increase of inventories of manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian manufacturers have been calling on the government to
take measures to boost domestic consumption so as to revitalize
the sector.

Lo Yuk Sui, chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA), said at the association's 39th annual meeting today that
visitor arrivals in the fiscal year were also a record 11.7
million.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is now the leading foreign exchange earner among Hong
Kong's service industries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong enjoys a 9.2 percent share of major tourist markets,
ranking the eighth in the world, he said, adding that tourism also
provides about 360,000 jobs for the people of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong's tourism and transportation
infrastructure is currently being transformed. By the end of year 2000,
close to 16,000 new hotel rooms are expected to be in service;
while the new airport at Chek Lap Kok will initially increase
passenger handling capacity to 35 million a year, with
an ultimate capacity of 87 million.
</P>
<P>
Amy Chan, executive director of the HKTA, said that the Hong
Kong Exposition being planned is financially viable as well as
logistically and technically feasible, as the findings from a
feasibility study demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
The Exposition will showcase Hong Kong as the leading business
and service center in Asia, position Hong Kong as the gateway to
the mainland, and position the inland areas as the major business
partner in Asia, she added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cautiously Optimistic over Albright's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Information Minister
Samir Mutawe today expressed optimism, with an "if," over the
current regional tour of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright who is now in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"If she forwards new ideas that could boost security
coordination and implementation of signed agreements between the
Palestinians and Israel," she would succeed in her mission to
salvage the deadlocked peace march, Mutawe said in a telephone
interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that focusing solely on the security issue as
Israel wants will never help achieve a just and comprehensive
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the importance of Israel's withdrawal from all
occupied Arab territories in order to bring about a just and
comprehensive peace for all parties.
</P>
<P>
Albright has been strongly criticized by Palestinian officials
for her statement following her talks Wednesday with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They called on her to adopt a
balanced stance that could help achieve peace and security for all.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Middle East News Agency today,
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat's
advisor Marwan Kanfani expressed deep concern over Albright's
adoption of the Israeli stance in general, especially with regard
to the settlement issue.
</P>
<P>
"Albright should have waited until after her meeting with
Arafat before making her statement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright will visit Egypt and Jordan starting Friday, the only
Arab countries to have peace treaties with Israel, after ending
trips to Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Her tour to the region was aimed at reviving the
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations that stalled since March due to
Israeli construction of a controversial Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Three S. Leone Army Officers Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 11 (xinhua) -- Three senior military
officers of the Sierra Leone army have defected after completing
a year's senior staff course in Nigeria, defense sources told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief of Defense Staff, Colonel Komba Mondeh and former
camp Commander, Colonel Sam Mboma had been at the Nigeria Armed
Forces Command and Staff College in Jaji in Kaduna since July
last year while the third officer, former staff officer, Major
John Sowa joined them in January for a four-month junior staff
course, one source said.
</P>
<P>
The three officers who should have reported for duty in
Freetown Wednesday have now been dismissed, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Mondeh, who was a key player in the 1992 military coup which
overthrew the civilian government of Joseph Momoh, was a
Secretary of State for Marine Resources in the military
government set up by Captain Valentine Strasser. He later became
Chief of Defense Staff before the military government was
replaced by general elections in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Mondeh is now with ousted president Tejan
Kabbah in Guinea, a statement confirmed the fact by the
clandestine radio which this morning carried an interview with
Mondeh.
</P>
<P>
Mondeh in the interview warned junta leader Major Johnny Paul
Koroma ''to hand over power to Kabbah without delay or face the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
''Koroma is too relatively junior to implement any meaningful
changes in the lives of the Sierra Leoneans,'' Mondeh said.
</P>
<P>
The other two officers have not been traced. Two senior
military officers, Lt. Colonel Tamba Momdu and Lt. Colonel Tam
Lettie who completed a year's senior staff course in the Armed
Forces College at Teshi in Ghana, returned home Wednesday, the
military said.

<HEADLINE> HK Hotel Occupancy Plummets in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Figures from the Hong Kong
Tourist Association (HKTA) showed that hotel occupancy plummeted
to 58 percent in July from its year-ago level of 87 percent, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
And the decline seemed to forecast a worse hotel occupancy this
 year than last year, said HKTA Chairman Lo Yuk-sui.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the disappointing hotel take-up on the monetary
turmoil in Southeast Asia which resulted in a decline in tourist
arrivals from countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Southeast Asian tourists coming to Hong
Kong dropped by a dramatic 30 percent in July compared with a year
 ago.
</P>
<P>
"The next three months will be the crucial period. We have
taken remedial measures but these may not have an immediate
effect," Lo said.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the World Bank-International Monetary Fund
conference to be held later this month might help boost hotel
occupancy for September.

<P>
LUANDA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese State Secretary
for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Jose Lamego said today the
Angolan Peace Process is now at a crucial point, urging the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
"take a remarkable step."
</P>
<P>
Lamego made the statement here when he arrived in the airport
to start his three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that Portugal and the other two observers of the Angolan
Peace Process, the United States and Russia, all believed that all
parties involved, especially UNITA, should solve the current
difficulties though political means instead of confrontations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to UN resolution to impose sanctions on UNITA, the
secretary said, once the resolution goes into force, Portugal,
like the entire international community, will carry it out since
the resolution reflects the attitude of the world.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Portuguese armed forces in the UN observers'
mission have any plan for withdrawal, Lamego said, the UN mission
will not expire until next February, and Portugal will have no
plan for withdrawal in addition to this date.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit, Lamego is expected to hold talks
with Angolan President, Foreign Minister and UN special envoy in
Angola on issues concerning the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Investment for China's Three Gorges Dam Powerlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China will spend 50 billion
yuan (6 US dollars) on power transmission lines for the gigantic
dam at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used for 9,100 km of 500 kilovolt power
lines.
</P>
<P>
The amount of funding needed for power transmission equipment
was calculated at 27.5 billion yuan, at May 1993 levels, while the
amount for the dam itself was estimated at 90 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Actual spending on the Three Gorges Dam will exceed 200 billion
yuan if price increases and interest on loans are taken into
account.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Dam is expected to prevent flooding on the
Yangtze and to have an annual power output of 84.7 billion
kwh. The entire project will take 17 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The first group of generators will begin generating power in
2003. Power from the dam will mainly be transmitted to central and
east China, with a portion of it going to eastern
parts of neighboring Chongqing, which became a municipality last
March.
</P>
<P>
The China National Power Grid Construction Co. Ltd. is in
charge of the investment, construction and management of the power
transmission lines, which are being built at the same time as the
dam.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand To Jointly Build Hydropower Station (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Thai experts have
completed a joint feasibility study related to the joint
construction of a large hydropower station at Jinghong in the
lower reaches of Lancang River in southwest China Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Reports based on the feasibility study have been submitted to
concerned departments for approval, with recommendations expected
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
If approved, construction of the hydropower station, jointly
funded by China and Thailand, will begin early next year. The
plant will begin generating power in 2004 and the final
construction of the project will be completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The hydropower station will be linked to the nearest grid and
provide power to Thailand. Experts in the power industry note that
the Jinghong Hydropower Station will be the first project to
provide power to a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
The Jinghong station, one of several large power stations in
the lower reaches of the Lancang River, will have generating
capacity of 1.5 million kw for short-term development. The plant
will be built at an estimated eight billion yuan, and will
generate 7.34 billion kw/hours of electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
Long-term development calls for the station, located some 400
km from the Thai cities of Chiang Mai and Bangkok, to have a
generating capacity of 3.2 million kw in the second year of
operation.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand To Jointly Build Hydropower Station (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts say that countries in the Lancang-Mekong River Valley,
including China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Viet Nam, have
focused extensive attention on the construction of a large
transregional power grid.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Jinghong station, which is completely in
line with China's intent to encourage various forms of investment
in power development over the next few years, will play a
pioneering and exemplary role in cooperation related to power
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese and Thai governments have exhibited great
interest in constructing the station. Chinese Premier Li Peng
expressed his support for the Sino-Thai cooperation. Li visited
Yunnan in May 1966 on a fact-finding tour and listened to a report
on construction of the power station.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit and senior Chinese leaders also
discussed construction of the hydropower station during the
former's official visit to China in last April.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Yunnan is blessed with abundant hydropower
resources combined with the fact that Thailand faces constantly
increasing demand for power required for economic development but
lacks energy resources provides a perfect scenarios for
cooperative power development between the two countries. Since the
early 1990s, the two sides have engaged in extensive negotiations
concerning issues related to cooperating in the construction of
the hydropower station.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study for the Jinghong station was funded by
the Sino-Thai Jinghong Hydropower Station Consulting Co, a company
jointly funded by the Yunnan Provincial Power Administration and
MDX Group Company of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The project represents the first time China has allowed a
foreign company to participate in preliminary planning for the
construction of a major power station.
</P>
<P>
The consulting company, which has registered capital of 500,000
U.S. dollars, was established especially for related work, and the
Yunnan Provincial Power Administration holds 52 percent of the
shares.
</P>
<P>
Power departments in both China and Thailand have conducted
extensive discussions and debates concerning power transmission
routes. The two sides have reached a consensus and are preparing
to issue a special report in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Jinghong Hydropower Station will greatly
improve China's policies concerning the introduction of foreign
investment for power development. However, the country's existing
regulations lack power development policies related to the use of
foreign funds to construct large hydropower stations linked to
power grids in foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> France Pessimistic About Situation in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine today expressed pessimism over the solution of the
Algerian conflict in the near future, and compared the present
situation in Algeria to that of 1962, when the French colonial
rule collapsed.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a conference of the Socialist Party held in
Montpellier, southern France, Vedrine said that the "fresh
break-out of violence" in Algeria seemed to be the response by
Islamic militants to the proposals by moderate Islamists to hold
talks with the military-backed government.
</P>
<P>
"It is not blind violence... but is opposing the start of
dialogue between the Algerian government and certain legalistic
Islamists who will take away the fruits (from the militants)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine was referring to less extreme groups of Islamic
fundamentalists in Algeria, including the former Islamic Salvation
Front, who want to talk with the government to seek a political
solution.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people were massacred over the past few weeks by
Islamic militants in villages near Algiers, in what was the worst
wave of violence against civilians since Algeria was plunged into
a civil war five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fresh outbreak of atrocities against civilians has drawn
worldwide attention and made the United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan appeal to the Algerian government to seek a political,
rather than military, solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that the present situation in Algeria is similar
to that of 1962, when the French colonial government was forced to
withdraw from Algeria by guerrillas who waged an eight-year war of
terror.
</P>
<P>
"The present war is extremely cruel. Our task is to prepare for
the post-war period (of Algeria)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation said that a human rights committee
attached to the French government will issue a resolution today on
the crisis in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for the French government to break
its silence over Algeria for years.

to decide its relation with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will produce CMAG's final report to the
commonwealth summit in Edinburgh, Scotland, in October.
</P>
<P>
Though there is pressure to expel Nigeria from the
organization, reports said it is more likely that Nigeria's
suspension two years ago will continue.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku denied earlier
that there is a plan to expel Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
When it was suspended from the commonwealth in November 1995
for executing author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni
activists, Nigeria was given a two-year ultimatum to improve its
human rights records.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria insists that the Ogoni nine was executed for murder in
accordance with the lawful procedure. It accuses the Commonwealth
of interfering in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria also argues that it has since made great progress. A
national human rights commission has been established to handle
with various human rights abuses, the transition to civil rule
program is going well.
</P>
<P>
But some commonwealth nations, especially Canada and the new
British government do not seem satisfied and are taking tough
positions on the issue.

<HEADLINE> First Meeting of Party Congress Presidium Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of the
presidium of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) was held at the Great Hall of the People here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Jiang Zemin attended the meeting and delivered an
important speech.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee of the presidium, which consisted of
Jiang Zemin and other 32 members, was approved by a show of hands
at the meeting which was presided over by Hu Jintao,
secretary-general of the congress.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, all the items on the agenda were adopted at the
meeting presided over by Jiang Zemin. And at the meeting, Ding
Guangen, Wen Jiabao and Zeng Qinghong were approved as deputy
secretaries-general of the congress by a show of hands.
</P>
<P>
All attending heard a report on the examination of all the
delegates' qualification by the credentials committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Party Central Committee decided
that the number of delegates to the congress be 2050. Of them,
2049 delegates were to be elected from the electoral units. One
of the delegates was then suggested by its electoral unit to have
his delegate's qualifications rescinded, owing to his serious
mistakes. The actual number of delegates now is 2048.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the elections of the delegates had been
conducted by following the principle of democratic centralism and
giving full play to inner-Party democracy. The overall election was
carried out smoothly, it said.
</P>
<P>
All steps of recommendation and election in all electoral units
were carried out in strict accordance with the procedures
determined by the Party Central Commitee, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over 95 percent of the grassroots Party organizations, and over
85 percent of the Party members took part in the election. All
electoral units conducted serious investigations about the
political qualifications, ethics, work achievements and honest and
clean work style of the delegates, it added.
</P>
<P>
The delegates elected are advanced and highly representative,
the report said, stressing that they firmly believe in communism.
They have earnstly studied Deng Xiaoping's theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and have been resolutely
carrying out the basic line of the Party, and all have made
outstanding contributions to the country's reforms, opening-up and
socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the credentials committee as saying that the
election of all 2,048 delegates to the current congress conforms
to the relevant procedures determined by the Party Central
Committee, hence the qualifications of the delegates are valid.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 14th National Party Congress, the Party
Central Committee specially invited 60 delegates to the current
congress, and they enjoy equal rights as the elected delegates.
</P>
<P>
The draft electoral method of the congress was approved at the
meeting and was then handed over to each delegation for
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
Items concerning the attending of observers and guests at the
congress were also approved at the meeting. The Party Central
Committee decided to invite relevant leading Party officials, as
well as a group of non-Party public figures to attend the congress
as non-voting participants.
</P>
<P>
These non-voting participants, totaling 296 in number, include
non-delegate members and alternate members of the 14th CPC Central
Committee, members of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, non-delegate nor specially invited delegates but
former members of the Central Advisory Commission and some Party
veterans.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a number of 140 non-Party guests were also invited
as observors to attend the opening and closing sessions of the
congress, and they include state vice-president, vice-chairmen of
the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC)
and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), leading members of the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce and all non-communist parties,
and figures without party affiliations, non-Party members of the
NPC Standing Committee and the CPPCC National Committee who are
now in Beijing, as well as representatives of ethnic minorities
and the religious circle.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the congress was approved by the presidium
meeting. According to the agenda, the 15th CPC National Congress
is to declare open tomorrow morning, and close on the afternoon of
September 18.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Join Information Super Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is set to join the
Information Super Highway this December, with the installation of
a 15-million-U.S.-Dollar national internet gateway with a
two-megabit capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Champion newspaper reported today that Nigeria has
signed an agreement with the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) which qualifies it to benefit from the latter's Internet
Initiative for Africa (IIA).
</P>
<P>
IIA aims to provide internet gateway for 10 to 12 African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, UNDP will grant 500,000 Dollars to
Nigeria for the installation of a fully functioning internet
gateway as well as related training and domain name registration.
</P>
<P>
After signing the agreement last week, Communications Minister
Tajudeen Olanrewaju reportedly said that he was happy that the
country's awareness and understanding of internet has improved
tremendously.
</P>
<P>
A report said Gambia has also been approved as a beneficiary
of IIA, while talks are still on concerning Sao Tome &AMP; Principe,
Burkina Faso, Congo, Central African Republic and Cape Verde.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Upgrade Agricultural Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Training programs are being
upgraded at Zimbabwe's colleges and institutes to equip
agricultural students adequately to face future challenges,
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Responding to issues and concerns raised by parliament members
during the debate on the presidential motion, Kangai said the
rapid technological advances made in the agricultural industry
demanded a high calibre of extension staff to be trained at
agricultural training institutions.
</P>
<P>
Certificate training is being phased out and all eligible
certificate holders in AGRITEX, Department of Research and
Specialist Services, veterinary services, and agricultural
education will undergo modular training to upgrade them to
diploma level, he said.
</P>
<P>
The lowest level extension agent will hold a diploma, while
higher national diploma courses will be offered at Chibero and
Gwebi Colleges of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said AGRITEX had decentralized to districts and wards
to become more responsive to service users, but mobility was
being severely hampered by inadequate transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.2 million individual farm families in
Zimbabwe to be visited by extension staff.

<HEADLINE> China's Relations With African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- For several decades,
relations between China and African countries have been based on
equality and mutual respect and China is a good friend of theirs,
Nigeria's ambassador to China, Zubair Mahmud Kazaure, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that China attaches great importance to Sino-African
ties, as seen in visits by President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng,
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, and Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen in recent years that have improved the traditional
friendship.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
China plays an important role in world affairs, but has never
tried to put pressure on other countries, Kazaure said.
</P>
<P>
The reason Sino-African friendships have withstood the test of
time is that China and the African states, as developing
countries, have similar histories of invasion and being bullied by
colonialists, and they now face the same task of developing their
economies and improving the living standard of their people,
Kazaure said.
</P>
<P>
China and African countries have always supported each other
and it has aided Nigeria and other African countries politically
and economically, and aid to African countries has become more
effective in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Kazaure has visited many places in China and has been impressed
with China's economic development marked by a high rate of growth,
and low inflation. Nigeria's economic exchanges with Shanghai,
Dalian and Qingdao have been increasing.
</P>
<P>
He has also visited Gansu Province, where dry-farming methods
are used. He said that the methods seem applicable to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said the the "China threat theory" is baseless and noted
that China is an influential country but one that has never used
hegemony and power politics, but has always emphasized that
international conflicts should be settled through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong is an example of China's not being aggressive, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that Nigeria hopes to see China's reunification at an
early date and that Nigeria and other African countries would like
to co-operate with a China that is becoming increasingly strong.

DHAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- About 200,000 women and
children of Bangladesh have been trafficked to Middle East in the
past 20 years, The United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Bangladeshi women and children were also

</P>
<P>
It added that the Bangladeshi Government was deeply concerned
at the growing trend in trafficking of women and children.
</P>
<P>
"The problem needs to be addressed from a regional perspective,
since trans-border trafficking from areas of poverty to areas of
prosperity involves more than one country," UNB quoted a
government document as saying.
</P>
<P>
The document called for common remedies to approach the problem

<HEADLINE> German FM Protests Croats' Boycott of Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel today strongly protested Croats' decision to boycott the
Bosnian local elections scheduled for the coming weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday in Bonn, Kinkel called the
boycott decision made by the Croatian Democratic Union "absolutely
unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
It was even more incomprehensible especially after the Serb
leadership in Pale apparently had approved their participation in
the elections Wednesday evening, Kinkel added.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Democratic Union decided last Tuesday that Bosnian
Croats would "refuse to participate in local elections," because
conditions were not yet ripe in Bosnia to hold them.
</P>
<P>
The union claimed that holding Bosnian elections violates
articles of the Dayton agreement and electoral program, and thus
also violates the interests of Croats.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, however, stressed that the elections must be held in
order to ensure adherence to the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he could hardly believe that "with the elections
only a few days away, it is the Croat side which has become the
political block to the political coexistence of different ethnic
groups in Bosnia on the basis of democratic elections."
</P>
<P>
He called on Croats' leaders to lift the boycott, threatening
that international financial aid to them could be stopped if they
denied the call.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also confirmed that he and his British counterpart Robin
Cook had issued a joint letter to the Croat member of the Bosnian
presidency, Kresimir Zubak, to protest the latest event.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Croats' boycott was caused by the
poorly-distributed power in Bosnia. In the Moslem-Croat region of
Mostar, Delwald and Zepa, Moslems are the majority, so the Croats
fear that they would not get a relevant majority in the
elections.

SEOUL, September 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea repatriated a
soldier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
through the truce village of Panmunjom at 10:30 Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government said that it was returning Cho
Kang-won, 22, under the South-North Korean Basic Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Cho, found on the small island of Kyodong-do in the Yellow Sea
on August 25, said that he accidentally fell into the Yesong River
from a small boat and asked to return home, the Defense Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
During the interrogations, Cho initially expressed an intention
to defect to the South, but soon reversed his decision. After
reviewing his case, the government concluded that he merely
drifted here and had no intention to defect, said the ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has several times repatriated DPRK's soldiers who
had accidentally drifted into southern waters.

<HEADLINE> UNRWA to Maintain Austere Despite New Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Relief Works
Agency (UNRWA) will maintain some austerity measures despite
pledges of fresh fundings from some donor countries, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released here Wednesday night by UNRWA's
Cairo office, Commissioner Peter Hansen said it canceled the
controversial school fees but will keep in place a cut of
international staff and freeze of recruitment of teachers.
</P>
<P>
This came at last as a relief to the worrying and angry
Palestinians. The U.N. organ, which is in charge of helping more
than some 3 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, had announced it faced a 20
million dollars deficit for fiscal year 1997.
</P>
<P>
It planned last month to charge tuition fees for school
children in Gaza Strip for the first time in nearly half a century
since the massive fleeing of Palestinians in 1948 following the
creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The projected austerity measures also included freezing
appointment of teachers and reducing hospitalization programs and
medical treatment services. Those had triggered widespread protest
from Palestinians and criticism from the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday donor nations gathered in Amman, capital of Jordan,
to try to plug the shortfall in the UNRWA budget. Japan pledged to
contribute 12.6 million dollars while the U.S. agreed to offer 7.5
million dollars, including 1.5 million dollars for refugees in
Lebanon. The Netherlands and Germany also promised to pay 1
million each.
</P>
<P>
UNRWA offered free support to the Palestinians over the past
half century. However, it says it faces an impossible task trying
to maintain services to a population of refugees growing at 3.8
percent a year while donations have not grown since 1993.

GUANGZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, is home to more than 500,000
specialists with graduate degrees of specialized technological
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Said individuals account for nearly 10 percent of the city
population.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has introduced various methods in recent years to
train or recruit more qualified personnel to fulfill the demands
of rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou has established a number of new universities to serve
as bases for specialized training, including Guangdong
Polytechnics University, Guangzhou Foreign Studies and Trade
University and the Southern China Institute of Science and

</P>
<P>
City colleges such as the Guangzhou Teachers College and
Southern China Construction College are also forging ahead,
according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal government

especially for the hi-tech sector. Two academicians from the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and a number of people with doctorate
degrees have moved to the city over the past few years.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's New Trades Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Terms like assessor, auditor,
or advertiser used to be foreign words to ordinary Chinese but
they're becoming much more popular these days.
</P>
<P>
The reforms and opening up that started in the late 1970s have
brought about a shift from the centrally-planned economy to a
market economy. Therefore, these new services have emerged to meet
the needs of a changing society.
</P>
<P>
Appraisal of assets came into being in the late '80s at a time
when China was reforming its state property management system, but
it's now involved in almost every aspect of business.
</P>
<P>
The country had 3,343 appraisers, with 55,000 employees, by the
end of last year, and business has spread to the non-governmental
sector.
</P>
<P>
Advertising has become a major means of enterprises to attract
customers. In 1996, the sector did some 36 billion yuan in
business, and there were more than 52,000 agencies with 510,000
staff members.
</P>
<P>
Other newly-emerging businesses include information services,
consulting, market surveys, computer applications, leasing,
entertainment, and accounting, legal advice, and auditing.
</P>
<P>
Electronic information industry has been listed as a pillar
industry in 24 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities,
according to Wu Jiapei, an expert at the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 20,000 businesses engaged in
information services, with some 400,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
However, not all the new businesses are doing well. The market
study business, for example, began in 1986 with four small private
institutions doing surveys. Now, there are more than 400
organizations, but they have trouble with the low market demand.
</P>
<P>
The new businesses may have good prospects though, because more
regulations, laws and standardized practices are being adopted to
guide their development.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While Scotland is voting today to elect its parliament,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is to meet with the protestant
leaders of Northern Ireland to persuade them to hold talks with
Sinn Fein. Rarely has a British prime minister so dominated the
political life of his country. In four months after he came to
power, Blair has increased the projects of reform which could
profoundly change the scenery of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
-- France will break its silence over the crisis in Algeria. A
French government commission on human rights will adopt today a
resolution on the situation in Algeria. The resolution will
denounce the Algerian authorities for failing to protect its
citizens, condemn the violence perpetuated by the Islamic
extremists, and accuse the security forces and militiamen
supported by the government of violating human rights.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The road toward the European single currency Euro seems to
be open now. Governor of the Bank of France Jean-Claude Trichet,
President of the European Commission Jacques Santer and German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl all confirmed on Wednesday that the
European single currency will be launched on time. French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin said that Europe is moving toward Euro
"freely", because France will not be the towrope of anyone.
</P>
<P>
-- The fall season of spectacles in Paris has begun, with all
the major theaters and concert halls presenting classic and new
performances by home and foreign troupes. Among those presented
are Cyrano de Bergerac, the Weddings of Figaro, as well as music

<HEADLINE> Party Congress to Last Seven Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), which opens tomorrow morning
in Beijing, is scheduled to last a week, a congress spokesman
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Great Hall of the People today, Xu
Guangchun, a spokesman of the 15th national Party congress, said
that the congress will last seven days, from September 12 to 18.
</P>
<P>
"The 15th Party congress is a meeting of great significance
convened in the new period when China has scored great
achievements in the reform, opening up and modernization drive,"
Xu told over 600 Chinese and foreign reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that the congress is a historic meeting held at the
turn of the century when the Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core is holding high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and leading the Chinese people of all ethnic
groups in an all-round advancement of the great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"It is a meeting which summarizes the past and prepares for the
future," he noted. "It ensures that the Party will carry out
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's behests and march unswervingly and
triumphantly along the correct line adopted since the Third Plenum
of the 11th Party Central Committee."
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the congress would uphold Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, review the Chinese people's struggles over the
past century, look ahead at the prospects of China's development
in the first half of the next century, and conscientiously sum up
the experience gained since the Third Plenum of the 11th Party
Central Committee, especially during the past five years following
the 14th national Party congress.
</P>
<P>
"It will lay out a strategic plan for the cross-century
development of our country's reform, opening up and modernization
drive, and mobilize the whole Party and Chinese people of all
ethnic groups to emancipate their minds, seize the favorable
opportunities, and continue to forge ahead in the pioneering
spirit for an all-round advancement of the cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He described the congress as "a major event in the political
life of the whole Party and the whole country" that will attract
attention world-wide, saying that the meeting would certainly have
a significant and far-reaching impact on China's future
development.
</P>
<P>
He then made a brief introduction of the agenda of the 15th CPC
National Congress, as well as the congress' preparatory meeting
and the first meeting of the presidium convened this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that after the First Plenum of the 15th Party
Central Committee, which is scheduled to follow the congress,

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Become First Rich Country in SA: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Economic
development will outstrip Indian and Pakistan by the first decade

Sangstha (BSS) today quoted a Pakistan economist as saying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China To Offer Better Terms for Foreign High-Tech Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to offer
more preferential policies to foreign-funded high-tech firms in
China in order to further boost foreign investment in the field.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies will cover taxes levied on the import of
equipment by foreign-backed high-tech firms.
</P>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, made the remarks in an interview with newsmen during
China's on-going first investment and trade fair in Xiamen,
capital of southeast coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Sun added that China will gradually introduce national
treatment for overseas-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the reform and opening policies,
China has offered a series of preferential terms for foreign
companies, including tax exemptions for imported equipment.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, 1996, China readjusted its taxation policy and
canceled the tax exemption policy for equipment imported by
foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that further improvements in investment environment
will include readjusted customs duties, income taxes and some
standard charges, as well as the gradual introduction of national
treatment for foreign-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that national treatment for foreign-funded firms is in
line with international norms and the fair competition principle
of the market economy. The final goal is to ensure that domestic
and foreign firms compete on an equal footing and share common
development, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
Sun went on to say that China is considering readjustments in
customs duties applicable to foreign-funded firms in order to
boost foreign investment in the high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that high-tech firms require a wide range of
imported advanced equipment, and that current customs duties and
value-added taxes will account 40 percent of the total value of
imported equipment, thus adding a great deal to production costs
and in turn affect the international competitiveness of related
firms.
</P>
<P>
China is therefore considering the introduction of more
preferential terms for foreign-backed hi-tech firms in order to
improve quality in the use of foreign investment and establish
more high-tech projects, according to Sun.
</P>
<P>
In June 1995, China issued a number of temporary regulations
guiding foreign investment and a directory for foreign-funded
industries to encourage foreign investors to place their money in
high-tech industries, infrastructure and agricultural
areas.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Book Fair Shows Buyer Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the record
business at a recent national book fair, people in the publishing
industry are worried about Chinese reading habits - or lack of
them.
</P>
<P>
The book fair last week in the city of Changchun in northeast
China's Jilin province set two records: 509 million yuan (about 63
million US dollars) in book orders, and 32 million yuan in sales.
</P>
<P>
But, half the orders and sales were for children's books,
textbooks, or reference books for school students. The traditional
emphasis on education among Chinese has remained in recent years,
according to Xue Youzhi, teacher of Jilin University. The problem
is that they seem to put too much stress on exam results, and not
enough on how they form their personalities and value judgements,
he added.
</P>
<P>
One survey done at the fair put education books at the top of
the best-seller list, followed by children's books, social
sciences, reference works, and literature. Books on science and
technology, including popular science, came in sixth.
</P>
<P>
Total book sales in China have averaged some five billion yuan
annually for the past several years, indicating that the Chinese
in general spend very little on books, about 4.1 yuan per person
each year, industry people note.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that per-capita spending on books in 1996
remained at about the same level as ten years ago, if not lower by
a bit. They point out that sales and orders of literary works are
mostly for classic novels and that the number of novels published
in recent years is declining.
</P>
<P>
But, books directed at rural readers are still welcome - to
publishers' great relief. One set of books intended for farmers,
for example, resulted in 680,000 orders.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Press and Publication Administration
says that, as a whole, a great number of the Chinese just have not
formed good reading habits, and "changing that situation takes
time and will require a concerted effort - including holding more
book fairs."

<HEADLINE> LTTE Hands Over Bodies of Sailors to ICRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Tamil rebels have
handed over the bodies of four ship crew members or army soldiers
killed in Tuesday's pre-dawn attack against a Chinese vessel off
Pulmoddai coast in Trincomalee District, local newspapers said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Sinhalese newspaper, Daily News, reported that the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) handed over the remains to
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it is still not clear whether there are any Chinese killed
in the attack or not.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two Chinese crew members were on board the vessel at the
time of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka on Wednesday sent two
diplomats to Pulmoddai to carry out investigations. They had met
senior army and navy officers in the region to discuss the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at a press conference held this morning at the Sri
Lankan Parliament, a military spokesman said that five Chinese
crew members were still missing. He made no mention of the
casualties suffered by the Chinese crew.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said there were 31 Chinese on board the cargo
and eight of them were missing.
</P>
<P>
The engine room of the cargo, the MV Cordiality, was seriously
damaged after the rebels fired several rounds of rocket-propelled
grenades to it. However, troops managed to save the ship as well
as its cargo of ilmenite after they repulsed the fierce attack by
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports put the death toll of both sides at 32, with
many people missing.
</P>
<P>
The 200-meter long MV Cordiality is the biggest foreign vessel
so far attacked by LTTE, shipping sources said.

GUANGZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Forestry Department in
south China's Guangdong Province, a pioneering province in the
nation's opening and moderization drive, has attracted 950 million
US dollars foreign investment in recent years, with 104 million
already used.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, which neighbors Hong Kong and Macao, has 9.13
million ha of forests, with a forest coverage rate of 56.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province's afforestation achievements and preferential
policies have prompted a number of major overseas companies to
invest in the local forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
Various overseas companies have provided loans, with others
participating in cooperative projects, and still others
establishing solely foreign-funded ventures. The province has also
absorbed foreign government loans and donations for forestry
development.
</P>
<P>
Foreign funding is earmarked for the development of
rapid-growth trees, fruit trees, timber processing ventures,
papermaking and institutions for scientific forestry research.
</P>
<P>
Six foreign companies had provided direct investments for
afforestation by the end of last year, with related projects
covering over 240,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Supports Sanctions Against Burundi: Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya supports the continued
sanctions against Burundi military regime imposed by an
extraordinary regional summit held last Thursday in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania, the Daily Nation today quoted Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moi asked a private Kenyan airline to stop its flights to
Burundi immediately, adding that African Airline International
(AAI) should respect the decision of the regional summit.
</P>
<P>
But Moi said, while Addressing a mass rally Wednesday in
Western Province, that Kenya had decided to lift the oil embargo
to Burundi and recently allowed Burundi to import limited amounts
of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The decision to allow oil import to Burundi, he said, was
intended to benefit ordinary citizens who were feeling the pinch
of the sanctions, he added.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Tanzanian government banned AAI from overflying
its airspace because the Kenyan airline had made flights to
Burundi in violation of the regional sanctions.

XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, a major heavy industrial center in the country, plans to
utilize four billion US dollars in foreign funds over the next
three year to upgrade 300 major state-owned enterprises.

Yang Baoshan said that Liaoning, northeast China's only coastal
province, is ready to offer flexible cooperative terms to overseas
business partners.
</P>
<P>
He said overseas business people are being encouraged to
establish joint ventures with local enterprises, which will
provide investment in the form of fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
He also invited foreign governments and financial institutions
to provide loans for upgrading existing enterprises. Efficient
enterprises with bright market prospects will be selected for
listings on overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Through international bidding, a number of major state-owned
enterprises will be leased or operated by overseas consortiums and
businesses, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Siemens plans to further
increase its investment in southwest China's Sichuan Province and
strengthen its cooperation with local partners.
</P>
<P>
Hermann Koelle, managing director of Siemens (China) noted the
vast potential Sichuan can offer in terms of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Koelle attributed Sichuan's importance for Siemens to the
province's comprehensive industrial system which covers areas such
as energy, metallurgy, mining, chemicals, machine-building, space
technology and electronics, as well as the fact that it is one of
the nation's priority areas for infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Chengdu Optical Cable Co. leads the nation with an
annual cable production capacity of 400,000 km. In addition, the
Siemens office in the capital city of Chengdu has earned profits
of 23 million US dollars over the past two years from sales of
telecommunications, medical equipment, industrial automation,
computers and various other ventures.
</P>
<P>
The cable company, established in November 1994 by Siemens
(China) and a local electric cable producer, will have an annual
cable production capacity of one million km following the
completion of second phase construction.
</P>
<P>
The completion of third phase construction will raise the
capacity even further to two million km.
</P>
<P>
Koelle said that Siemens plans to establish additional joint
ventures in Sichuan, including an interface network production
company in Chengdu's Hi-Tech Development Zone. Koelle said the
plant would be established with an initial investment of 30
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that Siemens has also formed a hydropower department
in the Chengdu Office to focus on preparations for establishing a
joint venture hydropower equipment production company.

<P>
LANZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 workers are
currently working full bore to complete second phase construction
of a water diversion project crossing the Tengger Desert in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Second phase construction of the Jingtaichuan water diversion
channel, which is designed to divert water from Yellow River to a
reservoir in Minqin County, Gansu Province, will be the first
Chinese project of its kind to cross a desert.
</P>
<P>
The project will also provide a guaranteed water supply for
irrigating 40,000 hectares of farmland in Minqin, located in the
northeastern part of Gansu Corridor which has suffered severe
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which will be completed at an estimated cost
of 246 million yuan, will require the construction of a channel
stretching 101.44 km and replacing 30 pieces of equipment at 13
pump stations along the main canal. The annual water diversion
volume will hit 61 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Construction commenced in November 1995 and the project is
scheduled for completion in 1999.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Minister Concerned About Trade-Environment Linkage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Agriculture and
Cooperatives Minister Chucheep Hansawat today voiced Thailand's
concern that environment and conservation issues are being
increasingly related to trade.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of a two-day meeting of ASEAN
ministers of agriculture and forestry (AMAF) in Bangkok, Chucheep
said AMAF needs to demonstrate both the political will and
commitment to ensure that emerging issues and challenges are
addressed in an effective and timely manner.
</P>
<P>
He said AMAF's commitment should include the ability to require
national government bodies to accelerate their work on key issues
arising from the trade liberalization process.
</P>
<P>
A key issue is its ability to meet increasingly high and more
strictly enforced sanitary standards, which are frequently used as
indirect barriers to trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) to pay greater attention to the potential impacts of the
meetings and agreements which are designed to 'strengthen the
linkages between trade and the environment."
</P>
<P>
The deliberations and consultations, he added, may affect trade
in ASEAN's agricultural products, and Thailand is presently facing
the problem in shrimp exports.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the meeting will come to a consensus
on a new agenda and new directions for AMAF, including the
development of more efficient operational mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Ministers from all nine ASEAN members are attending the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups in the world have accused the shrimp
industry of destroying mangrove forests and the coastal
environment, while the United States is demanding that a turtle
excluder device be attached to the trawler net to allow turtles to
escape if caught. Thailand's exports of shrimp have dropped as a
result of these accusations and demands.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran urged France to use its
influence as the head of the ceasefire monitoring committee to
stop current Israeli aggression on Lebanon, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
in a telephone conversation with his French counterpart Hubert
Vedrine Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to IRNA, the two ministers discussed the latest
developments in the Middle East and Israel's "new incursions and
transgression against the south Lebanese soil."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi expressed concern over the Israeli breach of the
ceasefire and its continuation of aggression on Lebanon,
stressing that the Israeli violation would further aggravate the
Middle East crisis.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine on his part described the regional situation as
dangerous and said that he had made contacts with both parties
and appealed for their restraint from violating the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire agreement, which was reached in April 1996
between Israel and Lebanon, bars the fighting sides from targeting
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The ceasefire monitoring committee consists of representatives
of Lebanon, Syria, Israel, France and the United States.

<P>
HARARE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A new policy demanding
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) before development can
occur in certain areas in Zimbabwe came into force this week, the
daily newspaper The Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The policy document was released here Wednesday at a workshop
on environmental management.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from government and non-government organizations as
well as environmental experts attended the three-day workshop
which started on September 9.
</P>
<P>
Development which is likely to cause serious environmental
damage are well planned by the developers and approved by the
Ministry of Mines, Environme nt and Tourism before work begins,
according to the document.
</P>
<P>
The policy applies to electricity generation and transmission
lines, water supply, oil or gas exploration, housing or
industrial developments, mining, waste treatment and disposal,
road, rail or airport facilities and other projects that can
cause damage.
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Ministry of Mines, Environment and Tourism
said provisions for fines would be included in revised versions
of the document. It was important to value the cost of the piece
of affected environment before fines could be worked out, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The document stresses that developers are required to consider
all aspects of the project they intend to carry out and discuss

<HEADLINE> Electronic Pet Makes Children Feel Lonely: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Playing with electronic pets
can be a cause of loneliness in children, says Sun Yunxiao, deputy
director of the Chinese Youth Research Center.
</P>
<P>
It can create obstacles to developing normal relationships with
others because it is merely a dialogue with a machine, Sun
explains, adding that playing with electronic pets alienates
children from their schoolmates and others.
</P>
<P>
Many children, especially those from one-child families, regard
electronic pets as a means of avoiding difficulties in study and
social activities, but that can lead to an inward-looking
personality.
</P>
<P>
Children who are obsessed with the pets usually care less about
others and are more likely to get angry over minor conflicts and
look for ways to get revenge, Sun says, suggesting that parents
encourage children to make friends with each other instead of with
machines.
</P>
<P>
China's State Education Commission has banned students from
carrying electronic pets to class.

Young-sam today downplayed fears of the end of the nation's
economic miracle.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, South Korean economy is currently experiencing some
difficulties as it undergoes a period of structural
transformation; nevertheless, the foundation remains sound," he
said in an address at the second-day session of the Korea Summit
in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
"The government is consistently easing regulations and pursuing
a policy of reform to facilitate industrial restructuring," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulties that the South Korean economy is undergoing
will serve as a positive impetus for industrial restructuring and
enhancing competitiveness. The government places major emphasis on
encouraging competition, expanding openness and reforming various
regulations to more actively promote a market economy," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"South Korea's experience, coupled with these efforts, I firmly
believe, will contribute to the development of the world economy
and warrants an optimistic outlook for our economy," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Archives Opens Historical Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Archives
recently opened more than 190,000 precious historical files dating
from the Republic of China (1912-1949) and the early period of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The archives welcomes people from all walks of life to view the
files, said director Zhang Gan, adding that overseas parties can
also gain access to the files by applying with the archives at
least one month in advance.
</P>
<P>
The archives has opened 530,000 of 1.65 million files in its
collections.
</P>
<P>
The most recent files opened to public record Shanghai's
political, economic, cultural and social history since the
beginning of this century.
</P>
<P>
Many of the judicial files, dating to the 1912-1949 period, are
valuable historical documents which will promote studies of the
judicial systems and legal history of the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that financial documents from more than 60 banks
and related subsidiary firms in the city will be extremely
valuable for research into the financial history during the
1912-1949 period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 4,000 files covering administrative
management, communications and law enforcement will be valuable
for research related to the history of the concession.
</P>
<P>
The 50,000 files recently opened cover the period between
1949-1966 and offer detailed accounts of the situation surrounding
Shanghai's economic and cultural development since the

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Courses In Psychology For High School Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will provide
psychology courses for all students in its 3,000 primary and high
schools by the year 2000, in an effort to help them cope with some
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Specialists will provide guidance for the students in China's
biggest commercial and trade center, which is becoming embarrassed
by the problems that more and more youngsters are having. Many
students say they feel depressed and under a heavy amount of
pressure. What is worse, the number of suicides has been on the
rise since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the situation to the fierce competition for
places at university and to the complexity of modern life. And,
the traditional methods used by Chinese schools and families have
not proven very ineffective in dealing with the problems.
</P>
<P>
To help the students with their psychological well-being is a
major job for Shanghai's educators, so psychologists have been
hired for some 800 schools in the past several years, and special
textbooks have been prepared.

<P>
XI'AN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, recently established a talent exchange
information network.
</P>
<P>
The network supplies the Xi'an Talent Market (XTM), the largest
organization of its kind in northwest China, with information on
123,000 people. The market helped over 11,000 people find new jobs
in its first year of operations.
</P>
<P>
XTM Deputy-Director Luo Kaiwen noted that Shaanxi is home to
more than 50 colleges and universities, but most graduates prefer
to work in developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
The network helps local enterprises attract experienced
technicians from across the nation and in the process has handled
over 20,000 inquiries via links with other networks across the
country, according to Luo.
</P>
<P>
"The market has installed 14 special phone lines to serve
job-hunters", said Luo, adding the XTM will join Internet next
year in order to provide people with an opportunity to search for
jobs worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Merger Produces World's Largest Skate Manufacturer in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A skate producer in Qiqihar in
China's northernmost Heilongjiang province recently became the
world's largest producer of ice sporting goods after it merged
more than 30 outmoded state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The merger has put idle state assets to work and helped expand
production capacity of the Heilong Group. With total assets of 1.3
billion yuan, it now has 60 percent of the world's figure skate
market and 80 percent of hockey skate market.
</P>
<P>
Heilong can produce 1.5 million pairs of skates per year,
compared to 160,000 in the past, and 90 percent of its sports
equipment is exported to markets in many countries, including
Japan, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, and Romania.
</P>
<P>
While honing its competitive edge in the international sporting
goods market, Heilong is expanding into other sectors like
packaging, pharmaceuticals, and paper making, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the group acquired the Qiqihar Paper Mill, with
assets valued at 500 million yuan, and intends to improve the
mill's technological level. The mill is expected to increase
production value by 600 million yuan each year.

<HEADLINE> Investment in West China Beating That in The East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Investment in the western
parts of China is 10.9 percentage points more than in the east
this year, a sign that the central government's attempt to narrow
the east-west gap is beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months, the west had 86.7 billion yuan in
investment, a year-on-year increase of 19.9 percent, compared with
a nine-percent increase for the east, according to Prof. Zhang
Hanya of the State Planning Commission's Investment Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, China has intensified
economic development in relatively poor western parts, which have
been given priority in project approval and fund allocation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, investment in the western was far behind that of the
east, but last year the gap began to close. It is not expected to
widen within this century, and will be gradually narrowed at the
beginning of the the next century.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of this year, state projects
accounted for 41 percent of the total spending on western areas,
but 59 percent came from the west itself, indicating greater
independence in development.
</P>
<P>
Ministries have also increased spending on infrastructure in
western areas. The Nanning-Kunming Railway line in southwest
China, which is partly open to traffic, will be electrified by the
end of this year. The 976-km extension project of the Southern
Xinjiang Railway line will be completed in 1999, ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan plans to spend 23.5 billion yuan on 58 key projects
this year. And a project for a cotton base in Xinjiang has begun,
with more than nine billion yuan in investment expected. The
region will produce 1.2 million tons of cotton by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
China's strategy to speed up economic growth in the west has
helped the area a lot, and the resource-rich west will be a new
economic growth area, economists say.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Increases Investment in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Siemens plans to further
increase its investment in southwest China's Sichuan Province and
strengthen its cooperation with local partners.
</P>
<P>
Hermann Koelle, managing director of Siemens (China) noted the
vast potential Sichuan can offer in terms of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Koelle attributed Sichuan's importance for Siemens to the
province's comprehensive industrial system which covers areas such
as energy, metallurgy, mining, chemicals, machine-building, space
technology and electronics, as well as the fact that it is one of
the nation's priority areas for infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Chengdu Optical Cable Co. leads the nation with an
annual cable production capacity of 400,000 million km. In
addition, the Siemens office in the capital city of Chengdu has
earned profits of 23 million US dollars over the past two years
from sales of telecommunications, medical equipment, industrial
automation, computers and various other ventures.
</P>
<P>
The cable company, established in November 1994 by Siemens
(China) and a local electric cable producer, will have an annual
cable production capacity of one million km following the
completion of second phase construction.
</P>
<P>
The completion of third phase construction will raise the
capacity even further to two million km.
</P>
<P>
Koelle said that Siemens plans to establish additional joint
ventures in Sichuan, including an interface network production
company in Chengdu's Hi-Tech Development Zone. Koelle said the
plant would be established with an initial investment of 30
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that Siemens has also formed a hydropower department
in the Chengdu Office to focus on preparations for establishing a
joint venture hydropower equipment production company.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a computer software system to automatically translate
Internet files into the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
The software has the capacity to translate 150,000 characters
per hour, with some 80 percent of the total content easily
understandable after the translation process.
</P>
<P>
The major problem hindering the development of the Internet in
China centers on the language barrier. Many Chinese users point to

BUENOS AIRES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay finally earned
a berth in the World Cup finals after a 2-1 victory over Bolivia
at Asuncion, Paraguay, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay launched attacks from the beginning of the match and
totally dominated the match. But a tight and effective Bolivian
defense allowed few shots at the goal and goal-keeper Carlos
Trucco also put up several superb saves.
</P>
<P>
But Paraguay finally broke the deadlock at the 27th minute when
goal-keeper Jose Chilavert sent a long pass to Richart Baez, who
headed the ball into the area for Miguel Benitez to score.
</P>
<P>
Nine mintues later, Carlos Gamarra made it 2-0 with a header
from a pass by Francisco Arce.
</P>
<P>
In the second half Bolivian substitute Ramiro Castillo sent a
pass to another second-half substitute Berthy Suarez who made no
mistake in scoring.
</P>
<P>
With the 2-1 win over Bolivia, Paraguay is now 8-2-4 with 26
points and qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time
since 1986.

<HEADLINE> Panama Unveils New Plan on Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Panama decided to set up
an agency to deal with maritime and fishery matters at the
end of an international conference on the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
In its 21st century-oriented shipping plan, Panama also decided
to develop new infrastructure -- inter-oceanic ports and railroads
-- to make itself a center of multi-model transportation.
</P>
<P>
Maritime companies and institutions from more than 40 countries
and regions gathered for the three-day conference, known as
"Universal Congress on Panama Canal" and intended to prepare for
the return of the canal's sovereignty to Panama at the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
"We will create the Maritime Agency of Panama (MAP) which would
be in charge to fulfill the numerous international agreements
already ratified by Panama on maritime and fishery issues,"
Panama's Minister of the Presidency Olmedo Miranda said today.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said one of the purposes of MAP will be to improve the
industrial activities in the canal in order to attract new clients
from all around the world.
</P>
<P>
The official said Panama`s project to improve the canal`s
performance is based on the United Nation Agreement on Maritime
Laws.
</P>
<P>
MAP will also support development of maritime industry through
taxation incentives, technical aid and market information.
</P>
<P>
"The latter includes tourism, primarily cruise tourism,
establishing seafood processing plants, and creating centers of
stock and distribution of merchandise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Miranda pointed out Panama is fixing an alternating
infrastructure to serve ships crossing the canal, like port usage,
technical maintenance, as well as the construction of a regional
railroad.
</P>
<P>
According to treaties signed by the governments of Panama and
the United States in 1977, the United States must deliver control
of the canal to Panama and withdraw all its troops from the canal
district no later than December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and China did not participate in the
conference because Panama invited Lee Teng-hui, leader of the
Taiwan authorities, to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on August 21, Brandt Juan Carlos,
associate spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, said, "The
U.N. has decided not to participate in the conference due to the
fact that if we do, we will be in a certain way violating another
General Assembly resolution that recognizes the People's Republic
of China as the sole representative of China in the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
On September 9, China expressed regret over Panama's decision
to invite Taiwan authorities to the conference. "The Panamanian
government has disregarded China's solemn statements and
admonitions, and has acted in violation of the U.N. Charter and
U.N. Resolution 2758," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen
Guofang told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of some Western countries also did not attend the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> State Helps Northeast China Ease Grain Storage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
since the end of last year provided a discounted loan of 950
million yuan (114 million US dollars) to help northeast China ease
the grain-storage problem.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning, Jilin, and Helongjiang provinces and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region are the country's major grain
producers, and several years of good harvests have effected a
bottleneck in the local grain storage.
</P>
<P>
The region now has 55.2 billion kg of grain stockpiled, but the
maximum grain storage capacity is only 53 billion kg. And some 42
billion kg of newly harvested grain this year also need storage
space.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Internal Trade Chen Bangzhu said recently at a
meeting on matter that the special loan provided by the central
government is expected to increase the storage capacity for 1.5
billion kg of grain.
</P>
<P>
Of the total discounted loans of 2.35 billion yuan (283 million
US dollars) provided nationwide in the past year, 40 percent have
been used for building low-cost storage depots or for renovating
old granaries in the region.

memorandum on the complete resolution of conflicts between the two
sides, in Moscow soon.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a joint communique issued today after
two-day talks held in the Abkhazian capital of Sukhumi.

</P>
<P>
Delegates from the United Nations and Russia also attended the

Abkhazia is an autonomous republic of Georgia. It declared
independence from Georgia in February, 1992. Armed conflict
between Georgian government troops and local forces followed in
Sukhumi in August the same year.
</P>
<P>
A ceasefire agreement was signed under mediation by the United
Nations and Russia in May 1994.
</P>
<P>

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government is
seeking ways to support the SAARC process including the
establishment of South Asian Free Trade Area by 2001, said
visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs
Karl F. Inderfurth.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth made the remark Wednesday at the airport after
concluding a two-day visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience with North American Free Trade Area, we
can offer some technical advice on how one goes about creating a
free trade area," he was quoted as saying by Nepali newspapers
published today.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Nepal, Inderfurth met Naeem U. Hasan,
secretary general of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), which groups Nepal, Bhutan, India, Sri Lanka,
Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
He also met Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand and
Foreign Minister Kamal Thapa.
</P>
<P>
If properly harnessed, Nepal's water resources will help boost
not only Nepal's economy but that of the entire region, Inderfurth
also said before departing for Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a huge hydroelectric potential of 83 million kw, but
less than one percent has been utilized so far.
</P>
<P>
Inderfurth, who assumed his current post in April, is on a
"familiarization tour" in South Asia.

<HEADLINE> Communication Minister asked by His Party to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Communication Minister Anwar
Hossain, who is also the Secretary General of Bangladesh's third
largest Jatiya (national) Party (JP), was asked by his Party boss
HM Ershad to quit his post in the Cabinet, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The JP Chairman, who acted as President of Bangladesh in 1980s,
told local news agency UNB that he had asked Manju to relinquish
the ministerial job and work full time for reactivating the JP,
which is beset with party split and lower morale.
</P>
<P>
"I advised him to think over the matter as I badly need him as
full-time secretary general for the interest of the party," said
Ershad, whose party lent support to Awami (people's) League in
forming government after last year's election.
</P>
<P>
Praising Manju for his sacrifice and contribution to the JP as
well as his organizational capacity, Ershad said he is a very
conscientious man and would certainly understand the present
reality.
</P>
<P>
The JP Chairman said his party workers and sympathizers
frequently questioned him about the dual position of JP as the
party secretary general remains in the government.
</P>
<P>
Claiming his party as a responsible opposition, the JP supremo
said: "We have never supported this government. Our stand is
clear: Support the good work and oppose the wrongdoing of the
government."
</P>
<P>
The JP leader also rejected the notion of mid-term election
proposed by the largest opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party,
saying the government should be allowed to complete its full
five-year term.
</P>
<P>
However, "if the government continues to prove failure on all
fronts and people get fed up with its rule, then the situation
might be different," he added.

SAN JOSE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A plan aimed to prevent
child labor from emerging will be implemented in Costa Rica by
governmental and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Farid Ayales said here today that the
implementation of the plan would guarantee education for children

Officials and social institutions are worried about tourism
advertisements which offer sex-tours in Costa Rica for foreigners

<P>
ZAGREB, September 10 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Minister Robin
Cook and his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, here today jointly
protested to Croats' boycotting the Bosnian local elections
scheduled for the coming weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter to the Croat member of the Bosnian
presidency, Kresimir Zubak, they expressed their regret at the
action of the Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska Demokratska
Zajednica), which claims "to protect the Bosnian Croats' vital
interests."
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered to Zubak by ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Democratic Union decided last Tuesday that Bosnian
Croats would "refuse to participate in local elections," because
conditions were not yet ripe in Bosnia to hold them.
</P>
<P>
The union claims that holding Bosnian elections violates
articles of the Dayton agreement and electoral program, and thus
also violates the interests of Croats.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Croats' boycott was caused by the
poorly-distributed power in Bosnia. In the Moslem-Croat region of
Mostar, Delwald and Zepa, Moslems are the majority, so the Croats
fear that they would not get a relevant majority in the
elections.

<HEADLINE> World Bank OKs Debt Relief Package for Bolivia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has agreed
to help relieve Bolivia's foreign debt and refocus the country's
resources on economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The effort, said the bank today, is part of a package agreed on
together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce
Bolivia's public debt by some 448 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The package is equivalent to about one-seventh of the recipient
nation's total external debt in what the bank called Net Present
Value (NPV) terms, the international lending agency said.
</P>
<P>
The deal, of which the World Bank has pledged some 54 million
dollars, is subject to confirmation of the other creditors of
Bolivia that they will provide their share of the debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
Over time, said the bank headquartered here, the 448 million
dollars NPV reduction is equivalent to a cumulative debt service
reduction of 600 million dollars in nominal dollar terms.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to cut the debt of Bolivia, the second after
Uganda to benefit from such a program, to a sustainable level, and
enable it to spend more for economic and social sectors.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik Says Meeting With Plavsic Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, Serb
member of the Bosnian Presidency, said today his recent talk with
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic yielded no positive results
on resolving the current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik made the remarks in a statement in Bijeljina, the
Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a four-hour secret meeting held Tuesday in Banja Luka,
Krajisnik suggested that Plavsic reverse "all illegal decisions"
and call the Bosnian Serb parliamentary and presidential elections
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic rejected the suggestion, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis among the Bosnian Serb leadership began in early
July, when Plavsic dissolved the parliament despite strong
opposition from it.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Court ruled in August Plavsic's decision
unconstitutional, a ruling opposed by Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Plavsic's exposure of high-level corruption led to
further conflict with Bosnian Serb hard-liners, who expelled her
from the Serb Social Democratic Party and called on her to resign
as president.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic insists that she would only step down if she was voted
out in a referendum, as required by the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Spain Meet Over Single Currency, Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Spain today renewed
their resolve for a single European currency and stressed the role
of the European Union in reviving the stalled Middle East peace
talks in the first day of their annual summit.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi and his Spanish counterpart
Jose Maria Aznar "spoke with one voice in reiterating their firm
determination to respect the timetable and terms" of the single
currency, an Italian spokesman said after the premiers met in
Bologna, a central northern city of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who joined 15 other
ministers from the two countries at the meeting, said "Italy and
Spain think they will present the right scorecards" at the end of
April next year, when the first wave of countries to be in the
single currency, known as "Euro," will be decided.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigo Rato, Spain's deputy premier and minister for economy,
was quoted as saying by reports reaching here that Italy and Spain
were focusing on "working together for the future of the Euro."
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the single currency, countries must lower their
budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP)
and their public debt to 60 percent of GDP. Their inflation rates
are also not to be more than 1.5 percentage point higher than the
average figure of the three best performing countries.
</P>
<P>
Though viewed as two countries having more difficulties in
meeting the criteria, Italy and Spain have managed to bring down
their deficit and inflation through austerity policies and fiscal
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Italy's deficit-GDP ratio, estimated to stand at 3.2 percent by
the end of 1997, is expected to drop to 3 percent in 1998, the
Internation Monetary Fund said earlier. And its inflation was
lowered to 1.5 percent in August, the lowest since the Spring of
1969, said Italy's national statistics institute Istat.
</P>
<P>
On Spain's part, inflation in March dropped to 2.2 percent, the
lowest in 29 years; and its public deficit was projected by an EU
report to fall to 3 percent in 1997 from 4.4 percent in 1996 and
6.6 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda of the two countries' summit is how to
revive the peace talks in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers agreed the first step now is to bring Israel
and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
They also said their own countries and the European Union as a
whole should play a role in restarting the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU will send its special envoy Miguel Angel
Moratinos to the Middle East after U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's first mission to the region.
</P>
<P>
The two countries today also signed a principle accord to set
up a new joint force for peacekeeping and relief aid missions.
The new force would be the third such international body alongside
a United States force and a joint Anglo-Dutch one.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Soars in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in July rose 62.7 percent from a year earlier to 906 billion yen
(7.9 billion U.S. dollars), marking the fourth consecutive monthly
year-on-year increase, the Finance Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise to the yen's depreciation
against the dollar and favorable economic situation abroad,
particularly in the United States and Europe, which boosted
Japan's exports of automobiles and office equipment, including
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
In goods and services trading in July, Japan registered a
surplus of 474.2 billion yen (4.1 billion dollars), up 421.6
percent from a year before, the ministry said in a preliminary
report.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in merchandise trade surged 50.5 percent to 1,042.8
billion yen (9.1 billion dollars), up for the fourth straight
month.
</P>
<P>
Exports expanded 12.1 percent to 4,165.1 billion yen (36.2
billion dollars), up for the 24th consecutive month, while imports
edged up 3.3 percent to 3,122.3 billion yen (27.1 billion
dollars), rising for the 36th month in a row, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In service trade, including tourism, Japan posted a deficit of
568.6 billion yen (4.9 billion dollars), down from a deficit of
601.9 billion yen (5.2 billion dollars) a year earlier, due partly
to a rise in the number of foreign tourists visiting Japan, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry believes that the surplus is unlikely to continue
increasing in long term in view of ongoing changes in Japan's
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Economists at private research institutions here, however,
forecast the surplus will continue to expand for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Said to Retreat From Afghan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Taliban forces have
been pushed back by opposition forces from Mazar-e-Sharif, around
300 kilometers north of Kabul, amid reports that the student
militia also retreated from the newly-captured airport of the
city.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources and foreign aid workers confirmed that the
anti-Taliban alliance forces were in full control of both
Mazar-e-Sharif, stronghold of Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik, and the
city's airport, the local newspaper The Muslim reported today.
</P>
<P>
Independent Afghan sources here said Wednesday evening that
Taliban fighters have finally retreated about 20 kilometers from
Afghanistan's second largest city after three days of fierce
fighting, The Muslim said.
</P>
<P>
However, the fear of an all-out offensive on Mazar-e-Sharif
still prevails as the Taliban are not far away from the city, the
Afghan sources said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban Interior Minister Khairullah Khairkhwa on Wednesday
claimed their forces were in control of Mazar-e-Sharif airport,
about eight kilometers east of the city.
</P>
<P>
He also requested the workers of the United Nations and foreign
non-governmental organizations to evacuate the city at the
earliest as the Taliban were all set for a decisive attack on
Mazar-e-Sharif, the only major Afghan city not in the Taliban's
hand.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who took control of Mazar-e-Sharif late May after
turning against his former boss Rashid Dostum, briefly sided with
the Taliban, allowing them into northern Afghanistan unopposed.
But after only five days, in a dispute over power-sharing, he
drove the Islamic militia out again.
</P>
<P>
Malik is supported by forces led by Afghanistan's former
military chief Ahmad Masood and Shiite group Hezb-e-Wadhat. Masood
has been battling the Taliban north of Kabul over the past two
months.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which now control about two-thirds of
Afghanistan's territory and the capital of Kabul, have vowed to
impose strict Islamic rule in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Shrimp Industry Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's
long-depressed shrimp industry has begun to recover this year with
the expectation of 42 million U.S. dollars worth of shrimp exports.
</P>
<P>
The 4,000 hectares of cultivated areas for raising shrimps are
fully operational and forecasts of shrimp exports for 1998 are
optimistically set at 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The best year for the Colombian shrimp industry was 1994 when
the output reached 9,500 tons and exports rose to 54 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industry shrank in 1995 and 1996 because of a shrimp
mortality rate of between 70 and 92 percent. In 1995, the output
dropped to only 1,500 tons.

<HEADLINE> Six Die on Indian Capital's Road Every Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- With an average of about
six road deaths every day, New Delhi, capital of India, records
the highest number of accidents every year in the country, the
Hindustan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
The most vulnerable are the pedestrians and cyclists. This year
till August 31, 508 pedestrians were killed and 2,062 others
injured in road mishaps in the capital, the paper quoted the Delhi
Traffic Police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Heavy goods vehicles and Bluelines buses are said to be the
main culprits, followed by cars.
</P>
<P>
According to a study by the Central Road Research Institute,
trucks and buses are responsible for 43 percent of the accidents
in India.
</P>
<P>
Poor planning of roads is blamed as one of the main reasons for
the high rate of accidents in the capital.
</P>
<P>
There are 2.8 million cycles and cycle-rickshaws on the Delhi
road as against 2.7 million motorized vehicles. However, the roads
have been planned entirely for the motorized vehicles and no
consideration was given to the non-motorized and slow-moving
vehicles.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The mobile phone division of
Italian public Telecom Italia (TIM) reported net profits of 615
billion lire (347 million U.S. dollars) for the first half of the
year, compared with 440 billion lire (249 million dollars) for the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
While net profits rose 39.7 percent, revenues climbed 29.3
percent, to 4,338 trillion lire (2.45 billion dollars) from
January to the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
The mid-year report approved by the board today also disclosed
that as of August 31, the number of TIM customers grew by 1.26
million over the first six months to a total of 7.7 million.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by TIM said the mobile phone company's
common shares have risen in value by 41.14 percent since the

operators.
</P>
<P>
TIM's technical investments in the period rose 10 percent to

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets Int'l Official on Bosnian Serb Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic today told a top international official that the
international community should not take side in the Bosnian Serb's
 recent crisis.
</P>
<P>
Only by political means and through elections, Milosevic was
quoted as saying here by Yugoslav news media reports, could the
political crisis in the Bosnian Serb Republic be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made during the Yugoslav leader's talks with
Carlos Westerndorp, the International High Representative for
Bosnia assigned to help implement the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the escalating confrontations between those
with the Bosnian Serb parliament based in Pale and others loyal to
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference earlier in the day, Plavsic alleged that
her foes, labeled as hardliners, were attempting to stage a coup
before the elections scheduled for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
However, Milosevic told Westerndorp that the cracks among the
Serb leaders didn't mean they held different views on going ahead
with the Dayton accord on peace for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, international forces should not be siding
with either side of the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Westerndorp talked to the press after the meeting that he and
Milosevic also discussed, among others, the restructuring of the
Serb Republic's police force.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, the Serb member of Bosnia's tri-partite
presidency, was present at the meeting, as was Westerndorp's
deputy Jacques Klein.

SAN JOSE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Uruguayan Foreign Minister
Alvaro Ramos today reiterated his country`s opposition to weapons
sales to Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
"We disapprove of starting an armaments race in the
hemisphere," said Ramos. He was commenting on a decision taken by
the United States last month to lift the high-tech armament
embargo on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
This decision, announced by U.S. president Bill Clinton, raised
concern over a possible armaments race which would bring disaster
to the continent.
</P>
<P>
Chile was the first Latin American country to say it wanted to
buy modern airships to renew its air force, a fact that worried
its neighbors including Argentina, Bolivia and Peru.
</P>
<P>
"We have turned a confrontation scene into a cooperation one,"
underlined Ramos who completed a three-day visit to Costa Rica
today.
</P>
<P>
During talks between Ramos and Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Fernando Narajo, Narajo said he was also worried about the
U.S. decision.
</P>
<P>
"What we should really fear most is the beginning of an
armaments race," Narajo said. "Weapons purchases hurt investments
in development."

MONTEVIDEO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 15 dead adult
dolphins were washed ashore in Uruguay's coastal departments of
Colonia and Canelones in the past few days.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy fully supports the
European Union's position on the Cyprus issue, which recognizes
one government and two distinct communities in the country,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with his Cypriot counterpart Loannis
Kasoulides who was visiting Italy, Dini said negotiations between
Greek and Turkish Cypriots on solving the dispute should
presuppose the peaceful coexistence between the two sides in a

</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
to the island country and took over one third of its territory in
the wake of a failed coup there seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have been
working for decades to reunite the divided island, but so far no
concrete results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Now the Greek-Cypriot-dominated government in the southern part
of the island is recognized by most countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the key to the final solution to the protracted
Cyprus dispute is in the hands of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the divided Cyprus should make joint efforts
to dispel prejudices and hostility and promote mutual trust and
understanding, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Cyprus' future membership of the EU, Dini reiterated
that Italy supports the island country in its efforts to join the
EU.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italian foreign minister said that in view of
the fact that there exist two distinct entities in the country, it
is unrealistic for the EU to accept Cyprus now.
</P>
<P>
Dini advised that the Greek and Turkish Cypriots make full use
of the country's application for the EU membership to promote the
process of reunification by holding concrete negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Any breakthrough in these peace negotiations could serve as
incentives to the acceptance of Cyprus by the EU, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was important for both the inter-community talks in Cyprus
and the talks between the island and the EU to progress
simultaneously, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dini stressed the importance of Turkish Cypriots'
representation at the talks between Cyprus and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Cypriot foreign minister also met with Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that Italy was confident about the holding of the
Cyprus-EU talks in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also called for a resumption of talks between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots under the aegis of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafoks Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktas met last month in Switzerland under the U.N.
sponsorship, but no progress was made.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urged to Boost Finance Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has urged
Thailand to strengthen the management of its finance sector while
pinpointing key areas that the country should tackle to revive the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Thailand's rules governing companies were weak
and its financial information lacked accuracy, timeliness and
transparency, according to The Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should set up a government unit to provide guidelines
for its financial institutions, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The country also should improve the supervision and appraisal
of its financial institutions while upgrading the quality of
economic information, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The bank recommended that Thailand strengthen its laws on
bankruptcy and foreclosure of credit contracts by improving the
scope for loan recovery and debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the country strengthen its foreign-debt
and exchange risk management to achieve a safe and orderly
development of its finance sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank called for immediate re-checking on the
value of assets and liabilities of the ailing financial
institutions and their potential for auction.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also cautioned that if the economic downturn
worsened because of the weakness in the property market, high
domestic interest rates and the fall in the exchange rate, it will
become more important for Thailand to improve its capacity to
identify risky and troubled institutions.
</P>
<P>
Early detection will limit the risk of weak institutions, it
noted.

<HEADLINE> Stone-Age Tribe Found in Irian Jaya, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A stone-age tribe has been
discovered in the northern coastal plains of Yapen Waropen in the
shadow of the Van Rees mountains in Indonesia's easternmost
province of Irian Jaya, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The tribe, estimated to comprise 500 families, live in four
areas: Bonoi, Tamakuri, Koweda and Waren," Father T. J. Yoteni, a
local official, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
They are a nomadic tribe that lives from the land so they are
difficult to be reached by the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official called on all parties, both national and
provincial, especially the church, to help these people who are
still living in the Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
A Protestant church has already asked 35 preachers to live in
the area to teach these people religion and farming techniques, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yoteni said they still do not know if the tribe can speak
Indonesian because it is difficult to reach these people.
</P>
<P>
No other details were given by the official about the tribe.

<HEADLINE> Tung: Good Sino-U.S. Ties Helps Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The best way for the
United States to help Hong Kong is to develop good relations with
China, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, Tung implied that it was wrong for some
United States congressmen to propose bills on elections in Hong
Kong. He advised: "The best way for America to help Hong Kong
is really to improve its relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
"A good and constructive relationship (between the U.S. and
China) will really help Hong Kong a lot as we move forward into
the 21st Century," Tung affirmed.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in October
would be successful. "I believe he will have a good visit."
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with U.S. legislators, Tung, 60, told
reporters that he explained to the congressmen the transition of
Hong Kong and elections to be held next year.
</P>
<P>
"It is (for us) in Hong Kong to decide what is important, what
is right," said Tung. He was speaking after a second day of
meetings with U.S. congressmen.
</P>
<P>
"Most of our friends...appreciate and understand how well the
transition has gone, ...how confident we are about the future of
Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Tung admitted that some congressmen "don't quite understand"
the issues in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that next year's legislative election will be
held in accordance with Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good way to do it. It's a gradual, step-by-step
approach and I think it suits Hong Kong very well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feels embarrassed by a bill on democracy in Hong
Kong advanced by Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Monday, Tung replied, "No."
</P>
<P>
"That is because...we in Hong Kong care very much about
democracy. Democracy is not the monopoly of the United States of
America, or any western nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we go forward in our own way that is right for Hong Kong,"
Tung declared.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who arrived here on Monday for a five-day visit to the
U.S., travelled to New York tonight and will return on Friday for
a meeting with President Bill Clinton at the White House.

the situation of one ago, the entire picture has improved, has
almost been overturned, with a lower rate of inflation, a balance
of payments which is very strong and a recovery in industrial
production."

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Stresses Need to Revive Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini today stressed the need to revive the Middle East
peace process after talks with visiting Saudi deputy premier and
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
Dini reiterated to Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud the
need to "rebuild a correct negotiating climate" between the
Israelis and Palestinians after a recent wave of suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
"A new start for the peace process is needed, and in particular
a strong commitment by all in the fight against terrorism, to
avert the risk that forces contrary to peace may win out," Dini
said.
</P>
<P>
He assured Prince Sultan that Italy and the European Union will
continue to work toward a resumption of peace talks, "in close
liaison with the United States."
</P>
<P>
Dini had just visited Washington where he voiced Italy's full
support for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's first
Middle East mission this week.
</P>
<P>
He also said Saudi Arabia can do a lot to revive the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia could "encourage a climate of moderation and the
resumption of talks" between Israelis and Palestinians, he said.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan, who last night met Italian Premier Romano Prodi,
concluded his Italian engagements today with talks with Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano and Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta.
</P>
<P>
In the later talks, Andreatta and his Saudi counterpart
completed a deal to sell 22 Agusta helicopters to the Saudis and
agreed to hold joint land, naval and air exercises.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorge Project Helps Curb Greenhouse Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environment protection
experts believe that the Three Gorges hydro-electric project will
help curb the global greenhouse effect and contribute to
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The project is the world's largest, with an installed capacity
of 18.2 million kilowatts and annual generating capacity of 84.7
billion kilowatt hours. It is expected to ease the power supply
shortage in eastern, central, and parts of southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Lu Youmei, general manager of the Yangtze River Three Gorges
Development Corporation cited an impact analysis by Chinese
experts as saying that if it were replaced by coal-fired power
facilities, ten 1.8-million-kw stations would need to be built.
</P>
<P>
And, in addition to waste water and gas, more than 100 million
tons of carbon dioxide that could contribute to the global
greenhouse effect would be discharged annually from the coal-fired
stations, and more than 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide that
could cause acid rain.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that Chinese experts believe that the ecological
effects of the Three Gorges project, like silt and the impact on
rare plants and animals, can be solved by specific measures.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy Expected to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economic growth
would slow down this year but is likely to pick up in 1998 as the
currency crisis was only temporary, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said last night that Indonesia's economic growth also
slowed down in the early 1990s due to a tight monetary policy. But
after the monetary policy was eased, growth rebounded in the
subsequent years.
</P>
<P>
"This economic growth slow down will be temporary. Next year
will see robust growth again," the local press quoted the minister
as saying at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
A lower growth rate this year was due to the government's tight
monetary policy and the postponement and rescheduling of large
government projects aimed at preventing the currency crisis from
worsening into an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We should not pursue high growth at the expense of other
important things," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said the country's
economic growth this year would slow down to about 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"But it may not be that bad, it may only go down to 6 percent,"
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy and Finance Saleh Afiff said
earlier that growth could fall to about 5 percent if the currency
crisis continued.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's economic growth fell below 7 percent in 1992 and
1993 following the tight monetary policy. But growth picked up in
the following years, reaching 7.5 percent in 1994, 8.2 percent in
1995 and 7.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to prevent the currency crisis from worsening into an
economic crisis, the government moved last week to revise its
budget, liberalize foreign purchase of local shares and strengthen
the banking industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has promised that he will not resign or dissolve the
House of Representatives before the passage of the new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of supporters from the provinces on
Wednesday, he said the opposition will not succeed in making him
dissolve the House or resign.
</P>
<P>
He said if he did that, it would be tantamount to destroying
the country and ruining its prospects.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the promulgation of the new constitution,
the draft of which is to be put to vote at the National Assembly
on September 27, he would push for passage of organic laws within
240 days, as required by the new charter.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was ready for the censure debate scheduled for
September 24 and 25.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition MPs have urged Chavalit to resign for
mismanagement of the economy. Others fear that the prime minister
might dissolve the House during the 15 days leading up to the vote
of the charter to delay its passage.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of clauses in the constitution draft which
are contentious and unacceptable to many politicians.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Rupiah, Stocks Follow on Regional Weakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah and
stock prices declined Wednesday following general weakness in the
region, dealers and stock brokers said here today.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was moving in tandem with its counterparts in the
region, with spot rupiah closing at 2,935/38 against the U.S.
dollar from an opening of 2,900/15 after two days of stability at
the 2,900 level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said general weakness in regional currencies had
affected the rupiah, which even touched its lowest level at 2,944
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stock prices in the Jakarta Stock Exchange dropped
3.84 percent, with the Composite Index falling 22.988 points to
close at 576.016.
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said the drop was driven by continuing local-led
selling of blue chips amid generally weak regional markets.
</P>
<P>
"The central bank's interest rate cut appeared to have been
factored in," an analyst said. "Players took profit as they
expected few strong positive surprises in the short term."
</P>
<P>
The central bank cut interest rates on Tuesday for bilateral
central bank certificates (SBI) by between one and two percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken as a follow-up to the government's reform
package announced on September 3 to relax the tight monetary
policy in stages.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 23 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies
to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar Strives for Better Transportation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is trying to improve
its road, railroad, water and air transportation in an effort to
step up national and regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, 4,363 kilometers of roads
have been added since 1988, extending their total length from
23,317 to 27,680 kilometers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bridges, big and small, have been built to ensure better
transportation and their number has gone up from 4,932 to 5,078.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, six major bridges across Myanmar's mighty
Ayeyawaddy River have been under construction to cut the travel
time between its eastern and western banks. Major bridges are also
being built above the Thanlyin and Chindwin rivers.
</P>
<P>
Railroads were also extended in the country. With the addition
of 1,110 kilometers in the past nine years, their total length now
reaches 4,272 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has also imported modern railway machinery, equipment
and materials from countries including Germany and China to
upgrade its railway transportation services.
</P>
<P>
To better its inland water transportation, the country is
making efforts to acquire more and more boats for its fleet plying
along the country's major rivers.
</P>
<P>
With the addition of more than 100 passenger and cargo vessels
in the past nine years, Myanmar's inland water transport has
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-97 fiscal year (April 96 to March 97), Myanmar's
Inland Water Transport Authorities provided transport services by
using 721 vessels.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Myanmar Five Star Line (MFSL), meanwhile, carried
out overseas and coastal shipping services with 23 vessels and it
is planning to obtain two more ocean-going multi-purpose vessels
from China to further boost its business.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative and private sectors have also been providing
inland and coastal transport services with a total of 4,440
vessels.
</P>
<P>
To promote freight transport, a new Myanmar international port
known as the Thilawa Port, together with 17 container wharves, is
being built with Singaporean, Malaysian and Italian-Thai
investments. At present, however, the Yangon Port is Myanmar's
main gateway to the world, handling all of its imports and more
than 90 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
The seaborne trade passing through the ports of Myanmar was 7
million tons in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
Air transport has also been improved in the country during the
past nine years with the establishment of joint-venture airlines
with foreign companies such as Air Mandalay and Yangon Airways
operating domestically and Myanmar Airways International flying to
seven destinations in the world.
</P>
<P>
To handle the increasing number of tourist arrivals and to
accommodate larger aircraft, two new international airports, one
in Mandalay and the other in Bago, are being built in addition to
the existing Yangon International Airport which has been renovated
and extended.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, Myanmar's
transport sector achieved a growth rate of 4.5 percent in fiscal
1996-97 over the previous fiscal year.

JINAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
has established a modern telecommunications network which features
program-controlled exchanges, digital transmissions, mobile and
paging communications, and teleconferencing facilities.
</P>
<P>
The handling capacity of public telephone exchanges in local
urban and rural areas approached 5.5 million lines by the end of
June, up seven-fold on figures for the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 4.22 million telephone subscribers,

provinces. Related projects are part of an overall plan to improve
the local long-distance telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The province has also installed satellite ground stations in
the coastal city of Weihai and the capital city of Jinan, in

<HEADLINE> More New Zealanders Rely on Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- nearly one in every three
New Zealand adults is now receiving weekly welfare payments,
according to the latest figures released by the government.
</P>
<P>
The figures available today showed that the number of people
receiving benefits excluding superannuation rose 4 percent last
year to 367,000.
</P>
<P>
If pensioners are counted, the total will reach 826,000,
meaning almost one in three adults is on the dole.
</P>
<P>
Among the beneficiaries, 5 percent of the unemployed and 26
percent of the domestic purpose benefit (DPB) receivers have been
on the list for over five years.
</P>
<P>
Social Welfare Minister Roger Sowry was quoted by a press
report today as saying the scheme to help people move from welfare
to work by the Income Support Services would help stem the rise in
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
He was particularly concerned about the high rate of growth of
people receiving an invalids benefit and his department is
reviewing it and the sickness benefit, "which will give us more
information to explain the reasons behind this rise."
</P>
<P>
But Patricia Schnauer, MP of the opposition ACT Party, blamed
the increase on welfare policy. "The DPB has created a huge
culture of dependency and single parenting evolving in this
country," she charged.

leading bidder.

</P>
<P>
-- The Australian federal government plans to spend up to 109

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Ghana, Argentina Reach Last Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt booked a quarter-final
seat at the Under-17 World Soccer Chmapionship after drawing with
Germany here on Wednesday. Germany remains Group A's top team
with seven points.
</P>
<P>
To the ecstacy of 90,000 Egyptian fans in Cairo Stadium, the
Egyptian junior footballers took the command of the game since the
kickoff and opened the account with a skillful shot by Mohammed
Eid in the penalty area in the 66th minute.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which had already qualified, broke even ten minutes
later with a swift header by Benjamin Auer.
</P>
<P>
Both sides exchanged attacks but failed to turn them into goals
in the remaining time. With five points at hand, Egypt will play
the winner of Group B on Sunday in its first quarter-final clash.
</P>
<P>
If Germany won, Chile would have qualified for the quarter-
finals. Chile defeated Thailand 6-2 Wednesday in Ismailia in
another Group A match, getting four points. Thailand was ousted
after losing three matches.
</P>
<P>
Ghana and Argentina also made it to the last eight of the
championship after beating Costa Rica and Bahrain 2-0 respectively
in the last round of Group D matches played in the Mediterranean
city of Port Said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Group D's last game played in the Egyptian northern city of
Alexandria, Ghana beat Costa Rica two to love, proving its
potential to dominate the U-17 championship.
</P>
<P>
The strongly-built Ghanaians scored one goal in each of the two
halves, showering the Costa Rican goalkeeper with a barrage of
effective attacks.
</P>
<P>
Coming second to Ghanaians, Argentina beat Bahrain 2-0 in
another Group D match played at Port Said, thus edging the
Bahrainians out of the championship.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Brazil, due to meet Thursday, have qualified
regardless of the result of their game, which will help only
determine their placing in Group C.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the tie on Thursday between the United States and
Austria, both ousted from the competition, will be just for
face-saving.
</P>
<P>
So far, Spain is the only qualifier for the quarter-finals in
Group B. Thursday's match between Mali and Mexicao, who have an
equal 3-point stock, will specify the other Group B qualifier.
</P>
<P>
The Under-17 World Championship started in Egypt on September
4 and will run until September 21.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Optimistic about Punctual Start of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today said he was optimistic that the planned single European
currency, the Euro, would be introduced punctually on January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a parliament debate on Wednesday, Kohl stressed
that his government would do its best to ensure that the Euro
would be launched at the agreed time and be a stable currency in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
"We want both: a stable currency and the Euro at the right
time. We have a good chance to achieve this," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Although he admitted that many Germans were still reluctant to
give up their rock-hard German mark for a still uncertain common
currency, Kohl stressed that there was no alternative to such an
option.
</P>
<P>
"The vast majority of Germans have long realized that the
welfare and peaceful future of our nation are linked to the single
currency and the European Union," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany has stirred up controversies in European capitals
recently when Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank,
said in a newspaper interview that a delay of the Euro would not
be "a disaster".
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Kurt Biedenkopf, premier of the German state of
Saxony, on Monday also made a concrete call for a five-year delay
for the Euro launch.
</P>
<P>
The Euro debate came amid rising doubts over whether key
countries in the E.U., including Germany and France, would be able
to meet the fiscal criteria this year to qualify for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the German parliament on Wednesday, German
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel criticized the recent debate on the
future of the Euro as "irresponsible and very dangerous".
</P>
<P>
The Euro was important not only for employment and export, but
also for maintaining credibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
The common currency was also a key topic at Wednesday's talks
in Bonn between German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and
Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.
</P>
<P>
Both of them expressed confidence that Germany would be able to
reduce its budget deficit this year to less than three percent of
gross domestic product in order to make the grade to join the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the majority of the German public, I have never
doubt it," Juncker said.

<HEADLINE> (rpt with correction)German First-Half Deficit Within </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany achieved a deficit of
3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half of
this year, within reach of meeting the criteria for joining the
single European currency, the euro, the Wiesbaden-based Federal
Statistics Office reported today.
</P>
<P>
European Union (E.U.) member states are required to keep
deficit under 3.0 percent of GDP for membership of the euro.
Germany has failed to meet the criteria over recent years. In
1996, its revised deficit stood at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics office, the state spending in the
first half dropped by 0.9 percent while revenues rose by 1.4
percent. As a result, deficit increased by 54.3 billion marks
(30.6 billion U.S. dollars), 3.3 billion marks lower than in the
first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's economic performance improved,
registering a real 2.0 percent growth, which contributed to
bringing down the deficit-to-GDP ratio.
</P>
<P>
The office also noted that it used the E.U. statistical
compilation methods in calculating the state deficit this time,
which excludes public hospitals, as opposed to its previous
practices. Adopting E.U. method could improve Germany's
deficit-to-GDP ratio by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points for 1997, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the deficit data, Peter Pietsch, chief economist
at Commerzbank, said: "We are now more firmly convinced that
Germany will achieve the deficit criteria."
</P>
<P>
The euro is due to be launched on January 1, 1999. A E.U.
meeting early next year will decide which countries will then join
the single currency.

<HEADLINE> Money Worries Found to Be Growing in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Americans are plenty
worried about their money, especially since their wages have not
been keeping pace with inflation, a survey by Money magazine said
today.
</P>
<P>
Three out of five people surveyed said that they were satisfied
with their financial situation. But the same amount said they were
worried about the future -- the highest level of concern since
1993, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
As in the past, women are more jittery about money than men.
Fifty-four percent of women said an unexpected bill of 1,000
dollars would be a big problem for their household, while only 36
percent of men said they felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
"Although people are confident about how the economy is doing
and how they are doing personally, their optimism is guarded,"
said Adam Richard, senior vice president of Willard &AMP; Shullman,
which conducted the survey for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that Americans are running up more debt.
The average monthly household credit card bill rose by 5 percent
last year to 263 dollars, while baby boomers with no kids are
blowing almost 10 percent of their pay on monthly credit card
payments.
</P>
<P>
The survey was compiled from 1,120 written responses to a
12-page questionnaire sent to 4,500 randomly selected households
across the country in May and June.

<HEADLINE> German Economy Up 2.0 Percent in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany registered a real 2.0
percent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half
of this year, indicating that the country's economy was gaining
momentum, the Wiesbaden-based Federal Statistics Office reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the country's GDP grew by a real 2.9 percent in
the second quarter, the office noted.
</P>
<P>
The figures heighten the prospects for an officially-projected
2.5 percent growth rate this year. In 1996, Germany's economic
growth was 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the office, the economic pickup came as a result
of strong exports, which increased by a real 9.6 percent in the
first half. During the period, the country's private consumption
remained weak, rising just 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the economic data, German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said that he expected the export boom would stimulate the
domestic business. As a sign of this, he added, capital equipment
investments in Germany grew by 3.6 percent in the first half.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: EU Agricultural Reform Remains in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The only result which the
European Union (EU)'s agriculture ministers achieved at an
informal meeting held lately in Luxembourg seemed to be letting
everybody concerned know that reform of the agricultural sector
would remain the most difficult issue in its integration process.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the three-day meeting, which closed Tuesday in
Echternach in Luxembourg, was to provide a forum for a full
exchange of views on further reform of the EU's Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), which was launched in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler had
wanted to take advantage of the meeting to gauge the extent of the
member states' opposition to the controversial Agenda 2000 reform
project which he has spent much time and energy promoting.
</P>
<P>
However, the outcome of this informal debate is of limited
significance though all the ministers agreed that now was the time
to embark upon the reform process and voiced unanimous support for
the fundamental objectives of the CAP reform drawn up by Fischler.
</P>
<P>
Much of the dissent expressed by the ministers focused on
specific aspects of the proposed reform, rather than its
overarching strategy.
</P>
<P>
Italy, while supportive of the general thrust of the proposed
reforms, was highly critical of the EU's current policy on beef
and milk.
</P>
<P>
Italian Agriculture Minister Michele Pinto said that the
current market organizations for these products favored intensive
farming models, therefore unsuited to Italian agriculture, which
is characterized by a far smaller average farm size.
</P>
<P>
He also agreed with Spain's Loyala de Palacio that the EU's
13-year-old milk quota should be urgently reviewed. Both ministers
described the proposed dairy market reforms set out in the July 15
package, which was launched by EU President Jacques Santer, as
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
They both expressed their support for a so-called "A/B" quota
system, whereby dairy farmers would be permitted to produce
unlimited quantities of milk for export, but would have to respect
strict quotas in producing for the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Henrik Dam Kristensen, agriculture minister of Denmark,
criticized the proposed dairy reforms at the meeting, saying that
it was insufficiently radical.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his support for either a complete dismantling of the
current quota system, or an introduction of an A/B mechanism of
the kind favored by Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
But the most fundamental critique of the reform project seemed
to have stemmed from German Agriculture Minister Jorchen Borchet,
who said that much of the work undertaken since 1992, particularly
the severe cut-backs in the beef, cereals, oilseeds and dairy
sectors, should not be ignored and even questioned.
</P>
<P>
Describing the market analyses which underlie the Agenda 2000
reform project as "extraordinarily pessimistic", Borchet argued
that EU farmers would always be able to compete on world markets
by virtue of the high quality of their products.
</P>
<P>
The German minister protested at the cost of implementing the
European Commission's proposals, which he estimated at four
billion ECUs (some 5.2 billion U.S. dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
In late 1980s, the EU's expenditure in the agricultural sector
neared 60 percent of its total budget. In 1996, the EU used almost
half of its spending to subsidize the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
On its way towards the Economic and Monetary Union, Agenda 2000
was put forward to abolish prices support, reduce the prices of
agricultural products and make EU farmers focus more on quality
of their products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 1994 GATT agreement obliged the EU to
drastically cut back on its price subsidies and the new round of
talks on agriculture scheduled for 1999 will compel the EU to make
further concessions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The EU was determined to reform its agricultural sector also
because it is preparing now to expand to Central and Eastern
European countries, some of which have comparatively higher
agricultural percentages in their gross national products.
</P>
<P>
Given that different EU countries have different agricultural
aspects and interests to think about, it seemed no easy task to
get even a "broad approval" for the agriculture chapter of Agenda
2000, which Luxembourg's Agriculture Minister Fernand Boden
however said he was optimistic about.
</P>
<P>
But he also indicated that the topic would be discussed at
every European Council session between now and the December
European Council, which analysts say signaled the hidden fear of
the EU ministers that the agricultural sector would remain a
thorny issue for quite a long time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Call for Action against South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Major automakers in the
United States have urged the administration to take action against
South Korea, blaming the latter for limiting access to its auto
market.
</P>
<P>
They expressed this in a letter to President Bill Clinton on
September 9, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association
(AAMA) said in a press statement released from Washington today.
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by chief executive officers of AAMA and its
three members, namely Chrysler, Ford Motor and General Motors,
said they wish to express their "growing frustration" over South
Korea's failure to honor its market opening commitments under its
1995 automobile trade agreement with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The situation is "unacceptable" when South Korea combined
closed domestic market "with government-directed policies to
promote an extraordinary expansion of excess automobile capacity
for export to open markets in the U.S. and around the world," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the three U.S. auto giants sold only 3900 vehicles to
South Korea which has a auto market of 1.6 million vehicles, while
in 1997, "the Korean government has not taken any positive action
to promote imports."
</P>
<P>
The letter said the automakers believe that South Korea's
maintenance of a sanctuary auto market is directly fueling its
auto industry's "aggressive international expansion".
</P>
<P>
On the basis of 3.6 million units turnout in 1996, the country
has planned to raise production to over 6 million units annually
by 2000, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing Korea to maintain a closed market while building huge
auto assembly capacity potentially will result in the permanent
loss of billions of dollars in U.S. automobile export," the letter
charged.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Korean government's actions unquestionably
deserve to be identified as priority practices that unfairly limit
U.S. market access under Super 301," the letter said, urging the
administration to respond with "serious and meaningful action."

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Beijing Talks with DPRK "Useful and Productive" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The State Department on
Wednesday called Beijing Talks between the United States and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "useful and
productive."
</P>
<P>
"Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman met
North Korea Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye-gwan today in Beijing.
The meeting was useful and productive. It was conducted in a
professional manner," spokesman James Foley told reporters.
"They will meet again tomorrow to continue their discussion."
</P>
<P>
Foley declined to get into details of the talks, saying "no
concrete news yet on that issue."
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting of senior U.S. and DPRK officials
since Washington granted political asylum to two DPRK diplomats
last month, which gave rise to tensions between the United
States and the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has claimed the two defected diplomats, Chang
Sung-gil and his brother Chang Sung-ho, were criminals and asked
Washington to return the two defectors.
</P>
<P>
DPRK officials have since left unattended a meeting with
U.S. officials on missile discussions in New York.
</P>
<P>
The United States hoped that the DPRK would not relinquish
a preparatory meeting for four-party peace talks scheduled in
mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Foley told reporters that Pyongyang had given no "indication of
a falling back" from attending the four-party talks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Albright's Visit Not Confined to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foregin Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that the agenda of U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's first visit to the Middle East is not
confined to the security issue.
</P>
<P>
"We know that security is a key item on her agenda, but it is
not the only item," he told the press.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt would examine with Albright various
dimensions of the regional situation.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed after her talks today with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Natanyahu that her three-day visit to Israel
would focus on the security issue.
</P>
<P>
However, she admitted that real security is inseparable with
real peace.
</P>
<P>
Asked on reported statement by American sources on a proposed
45-day halt of settlement construction in East Jerusalem's Jabal
Abu Gheneim, Moussa said it is not a matter of "halting" or
"postponing" construction, settlement building is in itself an
"illegal and illegitimate act."
</P>
<P>
Albright reportedly proposed following her arrival in Israel
today a 45-day freeze in Israel's settlement construction in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Albright will meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat before going to Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia
and probably Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been mediating between the Palestinian and Israeli
sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
March when Israel began building settlements in East Jerusalem.
The crisis is worsening following two rounds of suicide bombings
in West Jerusalem, killing 25 people and injuring more than 300
others.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Leaves for France for Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri left here tonight for France for a two-day visit aimed at
enhancing bilateral ties and discussing the Middle East Peace
process, Lebanese Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In France, Hariri will meet with French President Jacques
Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
This will be Hariri's first meeting with his French
counterpart, who assumed office in last June.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculations that Lebanon would fall victim to
the tense relations between Chirac, Hariri's personal friend and
ally, and Jospin who ousted Lebanon's traditional right-wing
allies from power in the recent French elections.
</P>
<P>
In addition to signing a 1997 financial protocol, the radio
said that topping the agenda of the talks between the two
countries' leaders is the situation in the Middle East and south
Lebanon which is being occupied by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, which had been under France's mandate before its
independence in 1943, has been enjoying good relations with
France.

<HEADLINE> German First-Half Deficit Within Reach of Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany achieved a deficit of
3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half of
this year, within reach of meeting the criteria for joining the
single European currency, the euro, the Wiesbaden-based Federal
Statistics Office reported today.
</P>
<P>
European Union (E.U.) member states are required to keep
deficit under 3.0 percent of GDP for membership of the euro.
Germany has failed to meet the criteria over recent years. In
1996, its deficit stood at 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics office, the state spending in the
first half dropped by 0.9 percent while revenues rose by 1.4
percent. As a result, deficit increased by 54.3 billion marks
(30.6 billion U.S. dollars), 3.3 billion marks lower than in the
first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country's economic performance improved,
registering a real 2.0 percent growth, which contributed to
bringing down the deficit-to-GDP ratio.
</P>
<P>
The office also noted that it used the E.U. statistical
compilation methods in calculating the state deficit this time,
which excludes public hospitals, as opposed to its previous
practices. Adopting E.U. method could improve Germany's
deficit-to-GDP ratio by 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points for 1997, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the deficit data, Peter Pietsch, chief economist
at Commerzbank, said: "We are now more firmly convinced that
Germany will achieve the deficit criteria."
</P>
<P>
The euro is due to be launched on January 1, 1999. A E.U.
meeting early next year will decide which countries will then join
the single currency.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Turns Out Longest Commercial Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Boeing rolled out the
world's longest jetliner, a stretched version of its new 777 at
its plant in Everett, Washington, today.
</P>
<P>
The new jet, modeled as 777-300, is 73.42 meters in length,
3.30 meters longer than Boeing's 747-400, the world's largest
commercial jet. With the ability to carry 550 passengers, the new
model is designed for high-capacity and medium-range routes.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the city said that Boeing has 50 orders for the
plane, all from Asian airlines, who plan to use it on such routes
as Tokyo-Singapore and Honolulu-Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific, the largest airline in Hong Kong, has ordered
seven of the new planes. It will take delivery of the first
777-300 in May 1998 after Boeing completes a flight test program.
The plane is to make its first flight in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Boeing delivered its first 777 in May 1995. The model 777-200
holds up to 328 passengers and can fly up to 13,160 kilometers.
The new plane, 10 meters longer than the earlier version, will
carry up to 394 passengers and up to 550 in all-economy
configurations, but with a range of 9,900 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Boeing, now producing about 30 jetliners
a month, plans to boost that rate to 43 planes a month by next
spring.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Committee Recommends Shelton to Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Armed
Services Committee today unanimously recommended that the Senate
confirm Army Gen. Henry Shelton as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff of the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The Committee's support for the current commander of America's
elite special operations troops came a day after he testified on
his nomination by President Bill Clinton to replace Army Gen. John
Shalikashvili, who is to retire by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The Senate vote is expected to be held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Shelton, who led U.S. forces in Haiti, would be
the third Army general in a row to fill a job that traditionally
has rotated among Army, Navy and Air Force officers.
</P>
<P>
At the hearing on Tuesday, Shelton promised to put the welfare
of troops in a shrinking post-Cold War military ahead of all
concerns and said he would continue a push to modernize U.S.
weaponry for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also said he would support Clinton's plan to remove the U.S.
troops from Bosnia in mid-1998, and was opposed to using U.S.
peacekeeping troops to arrest indicted war criminals in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Shelton's nomination in July came weeks after Air Force Gen.
Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, withdrew from
the running after it was revealed he had had an adulterous affair
in the past.

<HEADLINE> Lugar: Helms Dictatorial on Weld's Nomination Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September (Xinhua) -- Chairman Jesse Helms of the
U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is being "arbitrary and
dictatorial" by refusing to hold a hearing on William Weld's
nomination as ambassador to Mexico, Senator Richard Lugar said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Lugar, a prominent Republican on the Committee, made the
accusation on the "Today" show of the National Broadcasting
Company (NBC).
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, he is quite arbitrary and dictatorial with regard to
this hearing," Lugar said. "He has indicated that something will
not occur regardless of who in the world might want to have it."
</P>
<P>
Helms, who bowed to bipartisan pressure Tuesday and called a
"special meeting" on Weld, still insisted that "the Weld
nomination will not be on the agenda."
</P>
<P>
Lugar and other members of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee proposed the meeting although they did not say whether
they will vote for the nomination or not.
</P>
<P>
The White House, who strongly backs the nomination, welcomed
Lugar's challenge to Helms, and questioned the fairness of
Friday's special meeting.
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't make sense to the White House. The whole notion
of a presidential nominee not getting a hearing doesn't make
sense," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
