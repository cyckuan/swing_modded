	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Larry Combest and his wife stayed at the  
Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Club in Florida in March, courtesy of the 
Futures Industry Association -- the trade group for the commodity 
futures industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Republican's bill included dinner tabs for $167 and  
$141 per person, $504 per night in lodging costs and $316 in 
golf-related expenses over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately sponsored trips to places like Boca Raton, Palm  
Springs, Calif., and Hawaii are -- along with lobbying and campaign 
donations -- part of a coordinated strategy by special interests to 
influence Congress. While congressional ethics rules sharply limit 
most gifts, these trips are allowed for events like speeches, 
fact-finding and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	For members of Congress, the accommodations are often more plush  
than the standard government hotel room. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., 
and his wife were put up in a $900-a-night suite in Orlando, Fla., 
in February by a banking group. Hagel is a member of the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Three House members and 11 aides converged on the white sands of  
Hawaii's Hapuna Beach in January as guests of the American 
Association of Airport Executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The association of airport officials paid for the airfare, meals  
and hotel rooms so the congressional group could participate in an 
aviation conference along with airline executives, plane 
manufacturers and others in the air transport industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The players include old-line trade associations and companies --  
such as representatives of banks, railroads and manufacturers -- and 
new political forces like computer software giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., who attended the Hawaii  
conference at a resort hotel where all the rooms had oceanfront 
views, admitted, ``It's not a bad place in January. I wouldn't 
describe it as a torture chamber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sabo said the trip was worthwhile because there was ``a lot  
of serious work'' on airport funding issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Lewis, of the government watchdog group Center for  
Public Integrity, said such privately financed trips are a conflict 
of interest for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of an elaborate strategy by most special  
interests -- it's one arrow in their quiver,'' Lewis said. ``They 
... take them on lavish trips, hobnob with them on golf courses, 
they bring cash to the campaigns. And guess what? It works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airport executives who hosted Sabo have a huge stake in  
legislation to renew the federal trust fund that finances airport 
construction, and to increase airport passenger fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The association spent more than $175,000 on lobbying last year,  
just a small portion of the $36 million in lobbying spent by the 
air transportation industry in 1998. The industry's political 
action committees made more than $5 million in contributions in the 
1997-98 campaign cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Air transportation interests contributed $6,250 to Sabo, $22,480  
to Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., and $500 to Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., 
in 1997-98 -- the three congressmen who attended the Hawaii 
conference, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said the company also invites  
lawmakers to its headquarters near Seattle to combine discussions 
of the issues with technology demonstrations that ``we often can't 
bring to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Members reach out to us and say we'd like to get a look at  
this,'' he said. ``That's what we're looking to showcase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 members of Congress and 50 aides have visited in recent  
months, Sohn said, without specifying how many trips were paid by 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In House records, 13 congressional staffers reported trips paid  
by Microsoft to its Redmond, Wash., headquarters. Microsoft spent 
$3.7 million on lobbying last year, and its political action 
committee made $264,500 in contributions in 1997-98.

cycle, records show.

<HEADLINE> Cattle Farmers Buy Cave System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RONCEVERTE, W.Va. (AP) -- Jane Morgan bends at the knees and  
waist, shuffling through a dark passageway about 4 feet high. 
Suddenly, she stands and shines her flashlight into a depression in 
the rock ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	It's about 15 feet long, humped in the middle, slightly rounded.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is where Thomas Jefferson found the three-toed sloth.  
There's the head and there's the tail,'' she announces, pointing to 
smaller impressions at either end. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1791, she says, Jefferson found the prehistoric skeleton here  
in Organ Cave and had its bones removed to Monticello, his Virginia 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Morgan then launches into a recitation of all the other  
creatures that have made the southern West Virginia caverns their 
home over the centuries, including two endangered species of bats 
that still dwell within. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so interesting,'' she says. ``Every time I come in here,  
I find something new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To Mrs. Morgan and her husband, Sam, Organ Cave is a historical  
and geological treasure -- and a fledgling business. To their 
skeptical bankers, it's merely ``a hole in the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgans, cattle brokers used to buying and selling on  
impulse, bought the Greenbrier County cave on a whim last fall 
during an auction to settle the estate of the previous owner. They 
knew little of its history then, but enough to feel the cave should 
be locally owned. 
</P>
<P>
	The network of caves, stretching at least 40 miles, is a  
National Natural Landmark that held the encampments of Confederate 
soldiers between 1861 and 1865. The 200- by 96-foot wide ``chapel 
room'' near the main entrance housed religious services for 1,100 
men, many of whom worked mining saltpeter to make gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought it would be nice if someone in the community bought  
the cave and people got involved and took pride in it,'' Morgan 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgans went to the auction as observers, but left as new  
owners of the cave with a winning bid of $253,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in the cattle business for 30 years, you've got to  
gamble,'' Morgan says. ``You buy and sell on impulse. That's what 
we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgans had been inside the cave only once before buying it.  
After the auction, they walked the property lines, imagining the 
possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	As cattle farmers, they saw the perfect above-ground spot for a  
rodeo. Their 29-year-old son, Troy, a bull rider in Gastonia, N.C., 
helped stage the first one last fall. It drew 1,300 people. A dozen 
more were scheduled for the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morgans envisioned a log-cabin snack bar and gift shop,  
along with new walkways, guardrails and lights in the cave. They 
would hire guides to lead 90-minute tours for $10 per person and 
four- to six-hour ``wild cave'' adventures for $80 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything just came to us,'' Mrs. Morgan says.  
</P>
<P>
	But there was a problem: Money.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple had borrowed against their business and needed a  
loan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The banks were skeptical, to say the least,'' Mrs. Morgan  
says. ``All manner of people were making fun of us. ... They'd say, 
'Why do you want that hole in the ground?' That's all they thought 
it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were obstacles to credibility. The former owners kept no  
record of the number of visitors, so the Morgans were hard pressed 
to project a profit margin. They developed a business plan based on 
successful caves in Pennsylvania and Virginia, and sent more than 
20 copies to every branch of state government that might help. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenbrier National Bank provided a small loan after its board  
was assured that other investors would buy the cave if the Morgans 
defaulted. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bank official told us, 'If it works, you'll look like  
geniuses. If it doesn't: I told you so,''' Mrs. Morgan says. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia has at least 1,379 caves rivaling those anywhere  
in the world, according to the ``Karst Hydrology Atlas of West 
Virginia.'' Author Bill Jones, a consultant who teaches hydrology 
at American University in Washington, D.C., says at least 26 were 
mined for saltpeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Organ Cave contains 37 saltpeter vats from the Civil War and  
five from the War of 1812, all preserved in a state of suspended 
operation. The saltpeter work stopped abruptly when Union troops 
discovered the cave and captured the rebel soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The cave itself was formed by the Mississippean Sea about 500  
million years ago. Fossilized sponges and other marine creatures 
dot the limestone ceilings of its passageways. Today, the ocean is 
hundreds of miles east. 
</P>
<P>
	As they sought more money to develop their plan, the Morgans  
invited state and federal lawmakers to visit. Only Delegate Tom 
Campbell, D-Greenbrier, and Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., took the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a total lack of support from state government,''  
Mrs. Morgan says. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the Morgans offered part of their farm as collateral  
and got another loan. They now have eight employees and more than 
$600,000 to repay over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the business is off the ground: From April 1 through Dec.  
31, there were 7,000 visitors. The Web site, www.organcave.com, has 
drawn hundreds of requests for brochures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our vision is to make it a family-oriented place to come. Kids  
are bored stiff around here,'' Mrs. Morgan says. ``We want local 
people to have so much pride in what we're doing here. We want them 
to say to people who are here visiting, 'You cannot go back until 
you see this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And Mrs. Morgan has faith in the impulse that made her buy the  
cave. 
</P>
<P>
	``That doesn't mean we don't have a rough road ahead,'' she  
said, '' We do. But I'm at peace.''

<HEADLINE> New Offer Made in Car-Hauler Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Less than an hour before a strike  
deadline, company negotiators submitted a new economic offer late 
Monday to try to head off a strike by Teamsters against companies 
that haul new cars from factories to showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamster Chip Ross said the union was reviewing the offer, but  
gave no further details. A union source described the new offers as 
``comprehensive'' and that it likely would take time beyond the 
12:02 a.m. EDT Tuesday strike deadline to fully evaluate it. 
</P>
<P>
	No details of the offer were provided.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a source close to the companies' negotiating team  
said the talks likely would stretch into Tuesday, beyond the strike 
deadline. ``There's been enough progress that been made to pick up 
again tomorrow,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of not 
being identified further. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides resumed talks shortly before midnight.  
</P>
<P>
	A strike by the drivers, hauling cars from factories to  
showrooms, could mean longer waits for popular cars, union 
officials have said. Automakers also have worried that if a strike 
persisted beyond several days they would not have space to keep 
vehicles as they come off the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations represented the first major challenge at the  
bargaining table for the Teamsters new president James P. Hoffa, 
son of the legendary Teamster boss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, as the talks continued toward a 12:02 a.m.  
strike deadline, negotiations at times were stalled over management 
proposals that would establish a lower pay scale for newly hired 
drivers and permit hiring of part-time workers, spokesmen for both 
sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	But toward evening progress was reported as both sides met much  
of the time in separate meetings, sending informal proposals back 
and forth. Then about an hour before midnight, as the strike 
loomed, the companies submitted their fresh economic offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demands for concessions are still on the table,'' Hoffa  
said in an interview as negotiations went into the evening. ``I 
told them these are 'strikable' issues. I made that very clear to 
them.'' Management officials said the proposals are essential to 
meet competition from railroads and non-union haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	The haulers also demanded more flexible work schedules while the  
Teamsters sought boosts in wages and benefits and retirement pay 
for employees retiring after 25 years. The union also wants to 
block the haulers from giving union jobs to Mexican trucking 
companies, something the haulers claimed they have no plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that Hoffa is a factor. The son of legendary  
Teamsters leader James R. Hoffa was elected last December in the 
aftermath of a campaign finance scandal, and personally led the 
union negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important set of talks for Hoffa,'' said union  
spokesman Chip Roth. ``He'll be judged on his ability to deliver 
for the members. He knows the members will be watching him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said in the interview that he felt ``invigorated'' by  
leading the bargaining talks. Asked if the membership was watching 
closely, he said, ``I certainly hope so. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief management negotiator, said Hoffa's personal  
stake in the talks ``can't be discounted as a factor. It's his 
first national contract. Sure, it is a political concern that he 
has. But we're attempting at the table to reduce that as a 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics, yard and  
office workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides dueled publicly over the financial state of the  
unionized car haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth cited the industry's ``record profits,'' adding, ``This is  
not an industry in need.'' Hunter said statements about record 
profits were ``pure propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
Inc., said a strike would have an impact within days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some plants could be affected in a day or two because they'd  
run out of room to park vehicles that are coming off the assembly 
line,'' Healy said. He added that dealers' inventories overall are 
``normal to slightly below normal.'' Roth, the union spokesman, 
said a strike would mean ``people would have to wait for the 
hottest-selling cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Adler of General Motors Corp. said, ``We've got contingency  
plans'' but he did not specify them. He said that during a 
car-haulers strike in 1995, the company allowed dealers to pick up 
cars from factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vella, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co., said only that the  
automaker was ``watching the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne, spokesman for the management negotiators of the  
National Automobile Transporters labor division, said the 17 
companies hauled more than 15 million cars last year. But he 
insisted the revenue-producing miles for car deliveries has 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indicators to show the fiscal health of the companies are  
all downward because of the competition of the non-union trucking 
companies and the railroads,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Duchesne, 71 percent of the new cars now leave the  
manufacturing plant by rail, compared to 29 percent by the union 
carriers. Other competition comes from non-union haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a year in wages and  
benefits, with salaries at $55,000. The Teamsters said that 
management wants to pay newly hired drivers 30 percent less than 
the contract wage, with gradual increases eventually equalizing the 
pay.

allow securities firms, banks and insurance companies to sell the 
same financial products. The firm spent $3.8 million in lobbying in 
1998.

<HEADLINE> Belmont Stakes Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The year was 1977, and the owner of Secretariat  
was having a tough time believing the scenario that was unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
	Just four years after Secretariat became the first horse in a  
quarter century to win the Triple Crown, another horse was poised 
to accomplish the same feat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Who were they to try and steal our thunder?''  
Penny Chenery said. ``We put a horse in the Belmont just to make 
sure Seattle Slew ran the whole way. We wanted to keep him honest. 
We weren't giving anything away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither was Seattle Slew, who added the Belmont Stakes to his  
Kentucky Derby and Preakness victories and became just the 10th 
Triple Crown champion. Chenery's Spirit Level finished sixth in an 
eight-horse field, and the owner of Meadow Stable even admitted her 
colt didn't belong in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It turned out Seattle Slew was the real thing,'' Chenery said.  
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, an expected crowd of 80,000 will find out whether  
Charismatic is the real thing when the strapping chestnut tries to 
become racing's 12th Triple Crown winner and first since Affirmed 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GRANDPA BELMONT:* The Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the  
Triple Crown races, predating the Preakness by six years and the 
Kentucky Derby by eight. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Belmont was run in 1867.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BY A NOSE:* Only three times has the Belmont Stakes been  
decided by a nose -- the slimmest of margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Granville beat Mr. Bones by a nose in 1936; Jaipur beat  
Admiral's Voyage by that margin in 1962; and Victory Gallop spoiled 
Real Quiet's Triple Crown quest in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest margin of victory in the Belmont?  
</P>
<P>
	Secretariat's 31-length win over Twice a Prince in 1973.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WORKOUT CITY:* Patience Game, fifth in the Preakness, had a  
strong workout at Belmont Park on Wednesday, breezing 6 furlongs in 
1:12 1-5 under exercise rider Karl Keegan. The colt worked without 
blinkers for the first time in his last three works, and trainer 
Alex Hassinger Jr., will decide by Wednesday whether it's blinkers 
on or off for the Belmont. ... Lemon Drop Kid, who has one win and 
two seconds over the Belmont track, went 6 furlongs in 1:13 2-5 
with jockey Jose Santos aboard. ``He really likes this track, a 
horse for the course,'' trainer Scotty Schulhofer, who trained 1993 
Belmont winner Colonial Affair, said. ... Adonis and Stephen Got 
Even, trainer Nick Zito's entries for the Belmont, also worked. 
Stephen Got Even, 14th in the Derby and fourth in the Preakness, 
went a half-mile in 47 2-5; Adonis, 17th in the Derby and sixth in 
the Preakness, covered the same distance in 47 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IN THE WORKS:* Charismatic and the filly Silverbulletday, are  
scheduled for their final major tuneups on Tuesday at Churchill 
Downs before shipping to New York on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, runner-up to Charismatic in the Derby and Preakness, is  
set for his final workout Tuesday at Belmont Park. Trainer Elliott 
Walden returns to New York to oversee the work. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Charismatic galloped 2 miles for trainer D. Wayne  
Lukas, while Silverbulletday galloped 1 1/2 miles for trainer Bob 
Baffert. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's crunch time, Lukas said. ``I have no peace of mind at  
all. But this is what we strive for.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LARGE FIELDS:* The largest Belmont Stakes field was 15 in 1983,  
when Caveat defeated Slew O' Gold by 3 1/2 lengths. The second largest 
was 14 in 1875 when Calvin beat Aristides; and matched in 1996, 
when Editor's Note was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of 13 is shaping up for Saturday's Belmont.

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Lower Doses of Hormones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Women can take lower doses of hormones to  
prevent postmenopausal bone loss and get the same benefits with 
reduced side effects if they take calcium and vitamin D 
supplements, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	With a lower dosage, side effects such as weight gain, breast  
tenderness, spotting, pelvic discomfort and mood changes are slight 
to begin with and disappear within six months, according to the 
study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in 
today's Annals of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings could allow more women to benefit from the ability  
of hormones to prevent the low bone mass, or osteoporosis, that 
leaves millions of elderly women at risk of fractures, chronic pain 
and stooped posture. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of side effects, only about 20 percent of the women who  
could benefit currently take advantage of hormone replacement, said 
the study's authors from the Osteoporosis Research Center at 
Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower hormone dose also may reduce the risk of breast cancer  
associated with estrogen-containing supplements, though the study 
did not examine that risk, said one of the investigators, Dr. 
Robert Heaney. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 128 women over age 65 with low bone mass.  
They received either a placebo or 0.3 milligrams of CCEE 
(continuous conjugated equine estrogen) and 2.5 milligrams of 
progesterone daily for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, who also received calcium and vitamin D supplements,  
showed a 3.5 percent to 5.2 percent increase in spinal bone density 
as well as increases in total body and forearm bone density, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the lowest dose of estrogen considered effective in  
preventing bone loss was 0.625 milligrams a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The calcium and vitamin D supplements apparently were the key to  
the success of the lower dosages, Heaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have belatedly come to realize that most women in that age  
group are deficient in calcium and vitamin D,'' he said. ``We 
actually got a higher response with this low dose with calcium and 
vitamin D supplements than with the 0.625 milligram dosage without 
the supplements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If bone cells are to grow, they need materials, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can only do so much by flogging the workers. That is what  
the estrogen does to the bone cells. You have got to provide some 
bricks for them to build with,'' Heaney said. ``Many of us in the 
medical community have ignored the need to provide an adequate 
number of building blocks.''

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs on Brink Against Sabres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs will find out tonight if  
home ice is an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing the Buffalo Sabres 3-1 in the Eastern Conference  
finals, the Maple Leafs hope the Air Canada Centre will provide the 
impetus they need to rebound for the third straight series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing good at home,'' Toronto captain Mats Sundin  
said. ``It's going to be a different story. We're going to do 
everything we can. If we win at home, we're back in the series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't, they're out. And the way they played on the road  
in Buffalo has left the Maple Leafs with scant room for error. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night at the Marine Midland Arena, where the Sabres  
have yet to lose in seven playoff games, the Maple Leafs played one 
of their worst games of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Holzinger, Rob Ray, and Geoff Sanderson scored for Buffalo  
less than three minutes apart early in the second period as the 
Toronto defense collapsed in front of goaltender Curtis Joseph. The 
flurry transformed a 1-0 game into a 5-2 rout. 
</P>
<P>
	It was virtually a carbon copy of the previous game, only more  
lopsided. In Game 3 on Thursday night, the Sabres scored three 
goals in less than five minutes -- again in the second period -- and 
won 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrages like those are rare in the Stanley Cup playoffs, let  
alone at this juncture. The Sabres even scored a short-handed goal 
in each game. The Maple Leafs, who rallied from 2-1 deficits to win 
their first two playoff series, had not allowed a short-handed goal 
during the regular season and the preceding 14 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's face it. We didn't respond hardly at all,'' Toronto  
coach Pat Quinn said. ``It did happen very fast. I didn't expect 
we'd come back and win necessarily. But I didn't expect we'd have 
that kind of short response. We kind of disintegrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Maple Leafs had 59 shots at Buffalo goalie Dominik  
Hasek in the two games, he was rarely tested. The Sabres were 
intent on protecting the Dominator, who missed the first two games 
of the series with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us to every loose puck. They initiated every hit,''  
said Sundin, who scored both Toronto goals Saturday night, the 
first on his second penalty shot of the playoffs. ``Every play for 
the first two periods, it looked like our heads were somewhere 
else, like we were too tense to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto can't afford any more of that kind of uninspired play if  
it hopes to advance to the finals for the first time since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres, though, are intent on finishing the series tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is always the toughest game to win,'' said Buffalo  
defenseman Jason Woolley, who is tied with center Michael Peca for 
the team scoring lead with 12 points. ``They're going to throw 
everything but the kitchen sink at us. We'll have to get the good 
goaltending we've been used to getting. Dominik is getting 
stronger, and that's a good sign for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres checked the Maple Leafs doggedly in both games in  
Buffalo, outshooting the highest scoring team in the NHL during the 
regular season by a combined 20-9 in the first period. That 
strategy, as much to protect Hasek as to thwart the high-powered 
Maple Leafs attack, is not likely to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to come out and try to take it to them instead of  
weathering the storm as you tend to do as the visiting team,'' 
Woolley said. ``You don't want to give them a sign of life, or you 
don't know what will happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Hasek:  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very nice feeling to be close. We're happy again, but  
not excited. We know it's a very long way to go. We also know the 
Toronto Maple Leafs will come much harder in their own building, 
and we have to be ready.''

<HEADLINE> Sun's Weather May Add to Y2K Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As if potential Year 2000 computer problems are  
not enough, stormy weather predicted for the sun early next year 
also could torment Earth's modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean celebrating the new millennium in the dark, with  
a dead cellular phone. Ships and planes relying on satellites for 
navigation might have trouble. Even spacewalking astronauts are at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers, using new techniques, are forecasting the sun is  
going to enter the most violent and disruptive part of its 11-year 
cycle. The worst is expected to begin in January, when computers 
around the world struggle to cope with possible problems caused by 
the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe solar storms erupting with massive bursts of magnetic  
energy and radiation are expected to continue at their peak until 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Solar flares and coronal mass ejections -- solar explosions that  
can equal a million 100 megaton bombs -- send waves of energy toward 
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	They can cause power blackouts, block some radio communications  
and trigger phantom commands capable of sending satellites spinning 
out of their proper orbits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular telephones, global positioning signals and spacewalking  
astronauts all are at risk, experts said Monday at a national 
meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	There were two pieces of good news: The solar cycle is not  
expected to be as severe as some in the past, and, for the first 
time, there may be some warning, thanks to a government satellite 
that will detect bursts of solar solar energy and send about an 
hour's notice, said JoAnn Joselyn of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning, posted on the Internet and relayed through a  
special system, will give power companies time to align circuits to 
minimize or avoid damage from electrical surges, she said. 
Satellite operators can power down equipment or prepare to send 
corrective signals to their spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have plotted 23 solar cycles, using historic and  
modern measurements. But the current cycle may be the most 
disruptive ever because much of the vulnerable communications 
technology now in use is new and has not been exposed to maximum 
solar activity, Joselyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explosion in technology is intersecting with an extremely  
disturbed space environment,'' Joselyn said. ``There is much higher 
risk now because we depend more on technology that is vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joselyn said energy bursts from the sun can cause an electrical  
charge to build up on the surface of satellites, triggering phantom 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier solar cycle, she said, small rocket thrusters on a  
satellites suddenly started firing, sending the spacecraft out of 
position. Control of another satellite was lost when its gyroscopes 
were disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Joselyn said cellular telephone are vulnerable because they may  
use the ionosphere -- the region of electrically charged gases in 
the upper atmosphere -- to send radio signals, and bursts from the 
sun can disturb the ionosphere. Some cellular phone systems depend 
on satellites that are at risk, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Solar energy eruptions can cause warm air to surge up from the  
Earth. That can drag some satellites to lower orbits, forcing 
satellite operators to use rocket fuel to reposition the 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide navigation, for ships and airplanes, relies heavily on  
the Global Position Satellite system, which uses a fleet of 
satellites that can be affected by the sun, said Joselyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about the GPS more than anything else,'' she  
said. ``We're starting to land airplanes with that system now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electromagnetic energy from the sun can send huge waves of  
electrical energy surging along power lines, shorting circuits and 
burning out equipment. A 1989 solar storm caused a province-wide 
blackout in Quebec, and coils in a transformer station in Salem, 
N.J., melted and caught fire, causing a regional outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts generally are safe inside the shuttle or the  
International Space Station, but future missions to the moon or 
Mars will have to guard to solar radiation bursts. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the moon, they could get enough radiation to be lethal,''  
said Joselyn. ``If we fly to Mars, we'll have to consider the 
hazardous radiation from the sun.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Cancels Rogers Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A bomb threat forced the evacuation of more  
than 3,000 people at a Kenny Rogers concert at Royal Albert Hall in 
London, his publicist said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	No bomb was found and no injuries were reported Sunday night,  
publicist Cheryl Kagan said. The concert was supposed to be the 
last for the country singer during a 10-nation tour, but it will be 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely disappointed,'' said Rogers, who was about to  
take the stage when police recommended the evacuation. ``I don't 
understand who benefits from this. It's an unpolitical gathering of 
people who are out for a night of good fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Albert Hall confirmed the concert was canceled because of  
a security alert. They wouldn't say whether anyone claimed

<HEADLINE> Most Horses Don't Win Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not always fun to play the spoiler.  
</P>
<P>
	Just ask Chris McCarron.  
</P>
<P>
	``I got hate mail,'' said the Hall of Fame jockey, who in 1997  
rode Touch Gold to a three-quarters-of-a-length victory over Silver 
Charm in the Belmont Stakes and spoiled that horse's chance of 
becoming the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't consciously assume the role of trying to be a  
spoiler. My job was to get the best out of my mount. I was painted 
as a spoiler after the fact. I felt like I was just doing my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five horses have won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness,  
with 11 going on to racing immortality. Fourteen joined the 
bittersweet list of near misses by failing to win the final leg of 
the series, the 1 1/2-mile Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no asterisk next to the winners in the charts of those  
14 Belmonts, noting a Triple Crown bid was foiled in the process. 
And there won't be one Saturday should any one of about a dozen 
challengers upend Charismatic as he tries to become the first 
Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	But should the winner be anyone other than Charismatic, the  
mantle of spoiler will fall across his shoulders as surely as the 
blanket of white carnations. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron, who nearly guided Alysheba to the Triple Crown in  
1987, but was fourth behind Bet Twice in the Belmont, moved Touch 
Gold ahead of Silver Charm in the final 50 yards for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	```How dare you? Racing hasn't had a Triple Crown winner in  
20-some years. How could you do this?''' said McCarron, recalling 
some of the mail he received after the '97 Belmont. ``I was a 
little surprised to have received some letters, but I wasn't 
surprised with how impassioned they were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like McCarron, those who have been involved in the end of a  
Triple Crown run don't think of themselves as spoilers -- they're 
just trying to win one of the most prestigious and richest horse 
races in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years before Secretariat's magical run through the classics  
in 1973, another hugely popular horse, Canonero II, was poised for 
a shot at the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Blum, now a racing steward in Florida, was aboard 35-1  
shot Pass Catcher when he upended the Triple Crown bid of the pride 
of Venezuela before a record crowd of 82,694 at Belmont Park. Just 
a week earlier, Pass Catcher had run a strong second to Bold 
Reasoning in the Jersey Derby, and Blum knew his horse was ready 
for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was looking for a Triple Crown but me,'' Blum said.  
``I think all of Venezuela turned out at Belmont that day, waving 
flags and cheering for Canonero. It was a great scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ever remember being called a spoiler, but if that's  
what they want to call me now, fine. My job was to go out there and 
win the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's 131st running of the Belmont, Charismatic becomes  
the 26th horse with a chance to win the Triple Crown. Since 
Affirmed's '78 Triple Crown, the year after Seattle Slew won it, 
six horses have won the Derby and Preakness, but flopped in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The past three times, the horse bidding for the Triple Crown  
finished second. In 1989, Sunday Silence was 8 lengths behind rival 
Easy Goer; and the last two Belmonts saw Bob Baffert-trained colts 
fall just short of racing immortality -- Silver Charm's loss to 
Touch Gold and Real Quiet's nose loss to Victory Gallop in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas saddles  
Charismatic knowing spoilers are lurking everywhere, from the star 
filly Silverbulletday in Baffert's barn, to Derby and Preakness 
runner-up Menifee to the Allen Jerkens-trained Best of Luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Wayne does not like the fact that I'm going to run  
her, but if it was me going for the Triple Crown, you'd see five 
Lukas horses in there,'' Baffert said. ``As a trainer last year, I 
was hoping everybody would stay home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert finds himself in a unique situation for this Belmont.  
Bob and Beverly Lewis own Silver Charm and Charismatic, and there 
was talk the trainer might keep Silverbulletday out of the Belmont 
to give the Lewises a better shot at winning the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't do anything like that. We just want to win the  
Belmont, it's not about spoiling,'' Baffert said, the ``we'' 
including Silverbulletday's owner Mike Pegram. ``I've told Bob 
Lewis we're not trying to spoil your deal. The Triple Crown is made 
so if you are the best you shouldn't worry about anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Bob Lewis welcomes all challengers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted to see a full field because, if we win, then  
there will be no one on Sunday morning saying we didn't beat much 
of a field,'' said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Several jockeys have been involved on both sides of the Triple  
Crown chase, notably McCarron and Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens was aboard Silver Charm for the '97 classics, and he  
came back last year and rode Victory Gallop to the Belmont win over 
Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Day, who will be aboard Menifee in Saturday's Belmont, gets  
his second chance to play spoiler -- he was aboard Easy Goer in the 
'89 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of stopping a Triple Crown was not forefront in my  
mind,'' said Day, even though Easy Goer was second to Sunday 
Silence in the Derby and Preakness, just like Menifee has been to 
Charismatic this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to win the race because I contended all along  
that Easy Goer was the better horse. He was sent over in good form, 
and we got the victory very handily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about Saturday?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (trainer) Elliott Walden will get Menifee up to the  
race and give him an opportunity,'' Day said, ``and Lord willing, 
we'll upset the apple cart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Day knows a Triple Crown winner would be a gigantic boost to a  
troubled industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're crying out for one,'' he said, ``but given the  
opportunity to run by him, I want to win the Belmont.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Hancock, a co-owner of Menifee, gets his chance to turn  
the Triple Crown tables 10 years after his Sunday Silence lost to 
Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to spoil anybody's Triple Crown because I know how low  
it makes you feel, or at least it did me,'' Hancock said. ``But 
I've always thought things kind of go full circle. Pat Day was on 
Easy Goer and beat us. Kind of ironic he's on this horse.''

<HEADLINE> Weary Stewart Running on Empty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Tony Stewart was sprawled on the couch in  
his trailer, still woozy and lightheaded, every part of his body 
aching. 
</P>
<P>
	Covering nearly 1,100 miles isn't easy any way it's done. Do it  
in about 10 hours, in two different cars, in two different states 
and with a jet ride and a couple of helicopter hops thrown in, and 
it's downright brutal. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not even mentioning the queasy stomach during his  
hard-driving, high-flying and fast-moving adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eventful. Definitely eventful,'' Stewart said late Sunday  
after becoming the first driver to complete the Indianapolis 500 
and the Coca-Cola 600 in one day. ``I'm ready to lay my head down 
for the night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after a good night's sleep, he was off again. There was one  
last trip to Indianapolis, this one for the driver awards ceremony 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's fine,'' said Judy Dominick, his spokeswoman. ``A little  
worn out, but fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wrapped up his double quest in spectacular fashion  
Sunday night, charging from last to fourth in the Coca-Cola after 
finishing ninth at Indy. The finish moved him to fifth in the 
Winston Cup point standings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long day took its toll.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from two small bagels for breakfast and a couple of Power  
Bars, he didn't eat all day and was sick for the last 100 laps. As 
he climbed out of his Pontiac in front of a crowd of friends and 
media, his legs gave out. He sat next to his car for several 
minutes looking dazed before he was put on a stretcher and taken to 
the track hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused intravenous fluids, so doctors gave him water and  
Gatorade and cooled him down with ice packs. He was released after 
about 15 minutes and went back to his trailer to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good when I got out of the car at Indy. Physically, I  
didn't feel real bad,'' he said. ``About lap 80, I was starting to 
feel sick because I was getting hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His crew packed a few ice packs around him, and Stewart said he  
felt better. But with about 100 laps to go, he was barely hanging 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never use the headrest in cars and I used the headrest the  
last 60-70 laps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two drivers had tried the double before Stewart, who drove  
in the Indy Racing League for three years before switching to 
NASCAR's Winston Cup Circuit this season. Now he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	After gripping a steering wheel for three hours and trying to  
tame a car with handling problems at Indy, Stewart was whisked away 
on a golf cart to a helicopter waiting in the infield near turn 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flown to the Indianapolis airport where his sponsor, The  
Home Depot, had its private jet waiting for the 65-minute flight to 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart changed into his NASCAR driving suit and caught a quick  
nap on the flight, stretching out on the couch in the back of the 
jet after guzzling water and Powerade to rehydrate. Then it was 
into another helicopter for a quick flight to Lowe's Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	All that, and he still had another 600 miles to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``As much fun as I had today, it wasn't fair to (his NASCAR  
team) to give them 90 percent for the last few laps,'' he said. 
``As much as I'd like to go back to Indy, I'm going to stick it out 
with these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean he regrets his quest for the double, however.  
When he heard the strains of ``Taps'' play at Indy, Stewart got 
chills. And when he arrived at the Coca-Cola, some 150,000 fans 
stood and gave a deafening cheer as the helicopter flew low around 
the speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an experience I'll never forget,'' he said. ``To  
come in here and see the reaction from the crowd and to hear the 
applause at the drivers' introductions at the 500, I wouldn't trade 
it for anything.''

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Astronauts in Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Though it was nippy and noisy,  
space shuttle Discovery astronauts were overjoyed when they swung 
open the hatches to the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle commander Kent Rominger likened the visit to checking in  
to a ``fantastic hotel,'' with one major exception: ``Right now 
there's not a space toilet on board, so that makes living here 
permanently kind of tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Tamara Jernigan and Russian crewmate Valery Tokarev  
led the way inside the unfinished station Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely delighted to be aboard,'' Jernigan said as  
she and Tokarev floated aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make yourself at home,'' Mission Control told the seven-member  
crew. 
</P>
<P>
	But their welcome quickly gave way to work early today.  
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, Tokarev and  
Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor and began 
swapping out electrical meters on batteries that aren't charging 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced two  
electronics boxes for a communication system inside the American 
Unity chamber, where it was a brisk 57 degrees. The system, which 
allows ground controllers to transmit and receive commands from the 
station, had been on the blink since mid-April but fired up quickly 
once the repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your hard work has paid off!'' Mission Control radioed up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Well that's super news,'' Husband replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Rominger, Barry and Jernigan took a brief break from their work  
to participate in the first news conference of the mission. 
Rominger, a Navy commander who was deployed to the Persian Gulf 
during Operation Desert Storm, used the opportunity to pass along a 
Memorial Day message. 
</P>
<P>
	``My heartfelt appreciation goes out to all the veterans, and we  
wish them all the best today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the crew installed insulation around some fans inside  
Zarya to reduce the noise level, which Barry said measured up to 67 
decibels. Station officials hoped the mufflers would reduce the 
noise level to about 60 decibels -- equivalent to an office 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a little bit noisy in there,'' Barry said. ``I think the  
mufflers helped a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration downplayed the  
multitude of problems coming so soon after the space station's 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``In high-tech like this, you're going to have that happen,''  
Mission Control's Milt Heflin explained. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts also began lugging supplies from the shuttle into  
the station. They have until Thursday to unload 3,600 pounds of 
spare parts, computers, water and clothes for the first permanent 
residents, due to arrive next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, Jernigan and Barry attached another 700 pounds  
of gear to the outside of the station during an eight-hour 
spacewalk. The load included three tool bags and a pair of cranes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though they spent eight hours outside the seven-story-plus  
complex -- 1 1/2 hours longer than planned -- the excursion ended too 
soon for their taste. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be telling me we're almost done?'' Barry asked when  
it came time to go back in Sunday morning. His next word summed it 
all up: ``Wow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jernigan said it was an experience she would never forget.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being up high, seeing the space shuttle from a distance and  
the Earth in the background, was just spectacular,'' she said. ``I 
will carry that image with me for the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their spacewalk was just 34 minutes shy of NASA's all-time  
record, an 8 1/2-hour walk back in 1992 in which three astronauts 
grabbed a runaway satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth spacewalk on the space station since the first  
component, Zarya, was launched late last year. Astronauts have 
spent 29 hours working on the station's exterior, mostly back in 
December when the Unity module arrived and spacewalkers wired it to 
Zarya. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA estimates 158 more spacewalks, totaling more than 1,000  
hours, will be needed over the next five years to build and 
maintain the station.

	Kosovo Prisoners Tell of Beatings  
</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Ethnic Albanian men released from two prisons in  
Kosovo are reporting a pattern of savage beatings and abuse behind 
bars, the U.N. refugee agency said today. About 157 men who had 
been held at the Smrekovnica prison, northwest of Kosovo's capital, 
Pristina, arrived in Albania yesterday, following hundreds of 
others over the preceding days, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for 
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Another 51 men who had 
been held at a jail in Lipljan, 12 miles south of Pristina, arrived 
in Macedonia. Almost all the men released from the prisons have 
been heavily traumatized, with injuries resulting from daily 
beatings.

	More Casualties Reported in NATO Attack  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO pursued its heavy bombing  
campaign today, killing 11 civilians in strikes that hit a 
sanitarium and neighboring retirement home in Surdulica, southeast 
of Belgrade, the state-run Tanjug news agency said. NATO denied the 
report, which could not be independently confirmed. NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea said allied aircraft had attacked an ammunition depot 
and barracks late yesterday in Surdulica, but he denied the 
alliance had struck the sanitarium or retirement home. The Tanjug 
report today followed reports that 11 other civilians were killed 
yesterday when NATO missiles sent a bridge in central Serbia 
crashing into a river in another town as shoppers were heading for 
market.

	Remains May Belong to Rock Musician

<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Human remains found inside the wreckage of  
a minivan that plunged down a 200-foot ravine may be those of a 
rock musician missing since 1995, police said. The 1993 Ford 
Aerostar matches the description of a van driven by onetime Iron 
Butterfly bass player Philip ``Taylor'' Kramer. He was believed to 
be driving his van when he disappeared Feb. 12, 1995. The van was 
found by a hiker. The remains were being examined by coroner's 
investigators yesterday, authorities said. No identity has been 
released.

	Yeltsin Fills Cabinet Seats  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin and his prime minister  
filled several key seats today in Russia's new Cabinet after days 
of political infighting. Yeltsin named Viktor Khristenko to be 
first deputy prime minister and made Ilya Klebanov a deputy prime 
minister. Khristenko, a former deputy finance minister, is expected 
to have broad economic responsibilities. Klebanov is a relative 
unknown who has served as a regional political leader. Mikhail 
Zadornov, who quit last week as first deputy prime minister after 
only a few days on the job, was named Russia's liaison with the 
International Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders. Yeltsin 
dismissed the previous government earlier this month. 

</P>

	Yeltsin To Meet Chechnya's Leader

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Despite an increase in tension between Russia and  
Chechnya, President Boris Yeltsin said today that he still plans to 
meet with the leader of the breakaway region. Yeltsin said meeting 
with Aslan Maskhadov would produce ``serious conclusions'' about 
the future relations between the federal government and Chechnya, 
according to Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who met with Yeltsin 
today. No date for the meeting with Maskhadov has been announced.

found guilty of offenses under federal narcotics law, was also 
ordered to pay about $20,000 in fines and court costs. Hemp and 
marijuana are both derived from the cannabis plant. Rappaz was 
convicted of producing 8.5 tons of dried hemp, and selling some of

Czech opponent 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 and appears ready to contend for the

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled more flights  
Monday as pilots called in sick to protest a proposed pay cut. 
Neither side appeared willing to reopen negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since pulling out of talks with the pilots last week, Cathay has  
canceled a total of 103 flights, including 33 on Monday, affecting 
more than 10,000 travelers. The carrier has chartered flights from 
other regional airlines to transport its passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day disruption has hurt Hong Kong's tourism industry,  
which had been recovering from a lull due to Asia's financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong could not afford to have its flag-carrier airline  
turning passengers away,'' a statement from the semi-official Hong 
Kong Tourist Association said. Cathay accounts for a third of all 
Hong Kong flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and its pilots have been locked in a dispute since  
Cathay asked senior pilots in March to take an 8 percent pay cut in 
exchange for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Cathay abruptly pulled out of nine weeks of talks and  
gave the pilots a June 11 deadline to decide whether to accept a 
revised pay offer, including a smaller pay cut and better stock 
options, resign or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong carrier dismissed the pilots' counteroffer, which  
included annual pay increases after two years of cuts and a 
year-long pay freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots have been calling in sick en masse since Friday, claiming  
they are under too much stress because of the layoff threats. Union 
officials denied they had organized the strike, saying Hong Kong 
law allows pilots to stay home due to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Esther Lam, a spokeswoman for Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung  
Chee-hwa, said labor officials were eager to bring both sides back 
to the negotiating table. A government statement said officials 
hope they could resolve the dispute to avoid further flight 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither side appeared willing to back down.  
</P>
<P>
	Cathay spokesman Tony Tyler said the company would not reopen  
talks unless the pilots agree to forgo demands for guaranteed pay 
increases. But John Findlay, secretary-general for the Hong Kong 
Aircrew Officers Association, said the union would submit no new 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay has stopped taking bookings since late Friday for flights  
flying from now to June 17. The airline has been trying to cut 
costs since it lost $69 million last year -- its first loss in 35 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay's shares were badly hit Monday, the first trading day  
since the flight cancellations started. The company's stock tumbled 
9.8 percent even while the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 
percent.

 *Rupert Lonsdale    	
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Submarine commander Rupert Lonsdale, the only  
British naval captain to surrender his warship during World War II, 
died April 25 in Bournemouth, England. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonsdale later became a minister in the Church of England and  
finally Canon Emeritus. The cause of death was not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonsdale was the captain of the mine-laying submarine Seal which  
surrendered to the Germans in the Kattegat, the channel between 
Denmark and Sweden, on May 5, 1940. Lonsdale and his crew became 
prisoners-of-war. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonsdale was court-martialed when he returned to England at the  
end of the war in 1945, charged with failing to take immediate 
action to engage enemy aircraft and failing to ensure that the Seal 
was sunk. He testified that he deeply regretted the surrender, 
``but at the time it seemed the only thing to do.'' He was 
acquitted with honor.

 *Harold Grumhaus    	
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Harold Grumhaus, a longtime Chicago Tribune and  
Tribune Co. executive, died Saturday at his home in Naples, Fla. He 
was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	During his nearly four decades with the Tribune, Grumhaus held  
almost every top executive position with the company, including 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert in production, he joined the Tribune in 1934 and soon  
became a trusted aide to legendary editor and publisher Col. Robert 
R. McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	After McCormick's death, Grumhaus moved up through the ranks of  
the company and spearheaded the restructuring of corporate 
relationships that set the stage for the company to go public in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Grumhaus retired in 1976 as a director of Tribune Co. and  
chairman of its executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, a son, a sister, eight grandchildren  
and 12 great-grandchildren.

	STANTON, Calif. (AP) -- Thomas E. Coffin, an NBC researcher whose  
studies during the infancy of the television age showed the impact 
of advertising, died May 13. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffin conducted scientific studies that showed that people  
bought products after seeing them in television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all talk about it today as a given that people see  
television and act on it. But he was the first to document and 
quantify the effectiveness of advertising on television,'' said 
Nicholas Schiavone, NBC senior vice president of television network 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffin had been a psychology professor at Hofstra University  
until he left to become the network's market research specialist in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	His groundbreaking research, known as the Hofstra studies, found  
that brand awareness was ``hundreds of percent higher'' among TV 
owners, said Bill Rubens, who succeeded Coffin as head of NBC's 
research department.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Ralph J. Geffen, a federal magistrate who  
ordered the release of papers that documented the FBI's efforts to 
monitor gay rights organizations, died Wednesday after a two-month 
battle with cancer. He was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Geffen ruled in 1988 that there was no ``plausible law  
enforcement basis'' for the FBI's surveillance and infiltration 
operations, conducted for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Undercover probes by the FBI using paid informers were ``based  
upon the anti-homosexual bias of the late FBI Director J. Edgar 
Hoover and his belief that homosexuals, especially when organized 
or joining in groups, posed a threat'' to national security, Geffen 
said in his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI released more than 5,800 pages of documents, but many  
files were withheld and passages were blacked out on those that 
were released. 
</P>
<P>
	His ruling was made in a 1983 lawsuit filed by the American  
Civil Liberties Union.

Jr., who was awarded the Medal of Honor for bringing a badly 
damaged World War II bomber back to base despite his wounds, died 
Sunday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawley was a 24-year-old lieutenant when he participated in the  
Feb. 20, 1944 raid on German aircraft centers -- the largest raid on 
the continent at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	As Lawley's plane was coming off the target in Liepzig, Germany,  
it was attacked by 20 enemy fighters. Eight crew members, including 
the co-pilot, were killed, and the brand-new B-17 bomber was 
severely crippled, one engine on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawley suffered serious wounds around his face, according to his  
citation, but forced the co-pilot's body off the controls and 
brought the plane out of a steep dive.

	GAYLORD, Mich. (AP) -- Harry Melling, president of Melling Tool  
Co. and owner of the NASCAR team on which Bill Elliott enjoyed his 
greatest success, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Melling was in his 20th year of NASCAR Winston Cup Racing.  
Melling Racing won the Winston Cup points championship with Elliott 
behind the wheel in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years earlier, Melling's team won a then-record $1 million  
bonus -- the Winston Million -- from R.J. Reynolds for winning three 
of the four major races on the Winston Cup schedule that year -- the 
Daytona 500, the Winston 500 and the Southern 500.

fledgling state, died Friday at his home in New York. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	Recanati was born in Greece in 1924 and left for pre-state  
Palestine in 1935 with his family, which founded Israel Discount 
Bank. He enlisted in the Jewish militia Palmach and was sent to 
Egypt, where he worked to help Egyptian Jews reach Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	When the state was established in 1948, he founded the shipping  
company Israel-America Line, which brought badly needed food and 
weapons to Israel. Recanati served as chair of Israel Discount Bank 
from 1982 until 1986, when a Jerusalem court sentenced him to eight 
months in prison for fraudulent business dealings. The sentence was 
reversed on appeal.

historian who rediscovered the work of the woman who designed 
William Randolph Hearst's California castle, died Wednesday. She 
was 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Ms. Boutelle published ``Julia Morgan, Architect'' in  
1988, little was known about Morgan beyond her work on Hearst's 
spectacular castle, San Simeon. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book revealed that Morgan designed nearly 800 buildings, a  
legacy rivaling that of Frank Lloyd Wright. Her accomplishment also 
came at a time when women were rarely able to enter the profession. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Boutelle discovered that Morgan had worked alone and  
destroyed most of her blueprints shortly before her death in 1957. 
She reconstructed Morgan's designs from the scattered records of 
her former clients. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Ms. Boutelle was made an honorary member of the  
American Institute of Architects, the highest award the 
organization gives to someone who is not an architect.

</P>
<P>
	Gunther helped create shortwave, two-way and FM systems, often  
working with the military and police and fire departments. In 1932 
he built what is believed to be the first two-way mobile police 
radio system for the Bayonne, N.J., police department. 
</P>
<P>
	Gunther also installed one of the first one-way radios used on  
an aircraft. In 1931, he took part in the first public broadcast 
from an aircraft. A year later he installed the first two-way radio 
system on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined Radio Engineering Laboratories in 1925. It was there  
that he constructed and operated an experimental station that was 
one of the first shortwave broadcasting systems.

	With a law degree and a background with the National Labor  
Relations Board, McErlean was hired in 1945 by W.A. Patterson,

president and was a member of the company's board of directors. He 
rose to United vice chairman and UAL president.

<HEADLINE> Lake Poisoned After Pike Discovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE DAVIS, Calif. (AP) -- The pike are back, the state officials  
are back and Kelly Griffiths thinks, ``Uh-oh, here we go again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the aggressive northern pike were found in Lake  
Davis, the state Fish and Game Department got rid of the non-native 
predator by poisoning the mountain lake 220 miles northeast of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The pike, which authorities feared could get into California's  
river system and devastate salmon and trout, died along with almost 
everything else in the lake. 
</P>
<P>
	That October 1997 operation angered the town, inspired scores of  
legal complaints, led to a fruitless local criminal prosecution 
against the state and fed a lingering distrust of state officials. 
Just weeks ago, California agreed to a $10 million settlement to 
end the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	But the discovery last week of two mature pike, both about 3  
years old and 1 1/2-feet long in a shallow, weed-filled cove at the 
northwest edge of the lake, raised fears of a possible new 
infestation. 
</P>
<P>
	The crucial questions: Did they somehow survive the poisoning 19  
months ago or were they placed in the lake later? Have they 
spawned? 
</P>
<P>
	Through the weekend, pike-hunting Fish and Game agents with  
backpacks carrying long electrical probes, walked along the shore 
and zapped the water in the inlets and tributaries that feed the 
seven-mile-long lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to maintain a low profile, the agents intentionally  
stayed away from the main part of the lake, where anglers flocked 
during the Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, they plan to resume electroshocking from a boat  
drifting along the shallows. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to is to establish whether we have a  
self-sustaining population of pike. If we do, then we're going to 
have to sit down with the community and discuss what to do,'' Fish 
and Game spokesman Patrick Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Griffiths, a Portola resident who said his used furniture  
and home rental businesses depend heavily on tourism, was skeptical 
of the state's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, he said, the community will suffer another economic  
hit if visitors stay away. His own piece of the state settlement, 
which he said he learned Thursday, was ``four and a half cents on 
the dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's ridiculous. We've all suffered. My business went down to  
nothing. There have been pike all over the Midwest, all over the 
country, they are good game fish. Why not just go catch 'em?'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Less Baggage for Baffert at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert is going to the  
Belmont Stakes with less baggage than the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be enjoying this Belmont,'' he said Monday at  
Churchill Downs. ``The last two years I went there under the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He went to the Belmont with a pair of Kentucky Derby-Preakness  
winners -- Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet. Both finished second 
and failed to win the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Baffert's enjoyment has to be tempered by the fact that  
he will be trying to foil the Triple Crown bid of Charismatic, 
owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, who have about 20 horses with 
Baffert, including Silver Charm. Baffert will be trying to do stop 
Charismatic with the sensational filly Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only horses I get nervous with when I run them are her and  
Silver Charm because they have so many fans,'' Baffert said. ``They 
are stars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silverbulletday, winner of 11 of 12 starts, win her debut  
against colts and become only the third filly and first since Tanya 
in 1905 to win the Belmont, she would be queen of the Sport of 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't heard anybody say I shouldn't run her in the  
Belmont,'' Baffert said, referring to criticism of giving the filly 
a chance to foil the Lewises' chance to own a Triple Crown 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lewis has said he welcomes the challenge by Silverbulletday,  
owned by Mike Pegram, owner of Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, could become the 12th  
Triple Crown champion and first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Both he and Silverbulletday will be flown to New York on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday also was entered in the Derby and Preakness, but  
she was scratched when 20 horses were entered in the Derby and when 
she drew the outside No. 14 post in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no change of heart this time, says Baffert.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a shot,'' he said. ``The bottom line is there is  
only one guy I have to worry about and that's Mike Pegram, and he 
wants to run in the Belmont.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Silverbulletday did not run in the Preakness, Baffert  
said, Jerry Bailey told him if she ran in the Belmont he wanted to 
ride her. The filly's regular jockey, Gary Stevens, is now riding 
in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy who talked me into it is Jerry Bailey,'' Baffert said.  
``He thinks she has a great chance, that she has the right style 
and you can do anything you want with her. One thing about Bailey 
is if she can't handle it, he won't use her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of racing people think Silverbulletday is the best  
3-year-old in training, and she should be one of the three top 
betting choices with Charismatic and Menifee, second in both the 
Derby and Preakness, in what shapes up as a 12-horse field for the 
1 1/2-mile classic. Entries will be taken and post-position drawn on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert and Pegram said they are not worried about the size of  
the field or Silverbulletday's post position because of the 
distance of the race and size of the Belmont Park oval -- 1 1/2 miles 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Belmont is a different race,'' Baffert said. ``You have  
time to get into position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Belmont probables are Adonis, 17th in the Derby and fifth  
in the Preakness; Stephen Got Even, 14th in the Derby and fourth in 
the Preakness; Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the Derby; Patience Game, 
fifth in the Preakness; and five horses who will be making their 
debuts in Triple Crown competition -- Best of Luck, winner of the 
Peter Pan; Vision and Verse, Illinois Derby winner; Prime 
Directive, Illinois Derby runnerup; Pineaff, third in the Illinois 
Derby; and Teletable.

<HEADLINE> Coles To Appear Before IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Embattled Australian IOC member  
Phil Coles will appear before a special inquiry panel Thursday to 
provide ``personal explanations'' for conduct that could lead to 
his expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member panel advised the IOC executive board Monday  
that it had drafted a list of questions for Coles to answer before 
it makes its final recommendation in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have decided what we shall ask Mr. Coles on Thursday  
morning,'' panel member Marc Hodler said. ``We need his personal 
explanations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has already received a severe warning from the IOC for  
accepting lavish travel and other benefits from Salt Lake bidders, 
and is now under investigation for further allegations of abusing 
his Olympic positions. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife has told the IOC that the couple received jewelry  
valued at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid 
for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also has been accused of compiling secret dossiers on IOC  
members for Sydney's successful 2000 bid. Those files were also 
passed on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the panel would report its findings to the executive  
board at its next meeting June 16 in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel could recommend that the case be dropped or that Coles  
be expelled. Any expulsion would have to go to the full IOC 
assembly for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to solve this problem as soon as possible, not only  
for us, but also for him and for Australia,'' IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian executive board member Kevan Gosper left the room  
Monday when Coles' case was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reasons are very simple,'' he said. ``I'm too close to Phil  
Coles as an IOC member in Australia to risk any perceptions of 
conflict of interest,'' he said. ``I have previously said I 
wouldn't participate in any vote on Phil Coles. Now I'm absenting 
myself from all matters.''

<HEADLINE> Fans, Wrestlers Attend Hart Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Politicians and singers joined  
professional wrestlers and fans at a funeral Monday for wrestler 
Owen Hart. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, 34, known as the Blue Blazer, plunged 70 feet to his death  
last Sunday during a dramatic entrance for a match in Kansas City, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,300 mourners packed the invitation-only service Monday.  
Among them were pro wrestlers Hulk Hogan, Road Dogg, Gorilla 
Monsoon, Paul Bearer, Sgt. Slaughter and Stone Cold Steve Austin, 
who arrived on buses bearing a banner reading ``Owen You Will 
Always Be In Our Hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alberta Premier Ralph Klein and his wife, Colleen, also attended  
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	Singer Collin Raye opened the service singing ``One Boy, One  
Girl,'' Hart's favorite song, and ``Amazing Grace.'' Hart's six 
brothers were to serve as pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's wife, Martha, told mourners she had spent nearly half her  
life with the wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't sleep at all last night because I don't know how to  
say goodbye,'' she said. ``I don't want to let him go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, some 1,000 fans stood listening to the service over  
loudspeakers in a drizzling rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonnie Carpenter, 16, and a few of her friends skipped school  
for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost a great man -- he was a great role model for me and a  
great Canadian who spoke his mind,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, the son of former Olympic wrestler Stu Hart, launched his  
career with the World Wrestling Federation in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Hart's death appeared accidental. Hart may have  
inadvertently unhooked a harness while being lowered from the arena 
rafters, police said.

<HEADLINE> Temps May Not Stay Temps for Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Temporary workers are increasingly demanding employee benefits  
if they work as long and hard as permanent workers, compelling wary 
businesses to take steps so temps don't become de facto employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Take MindSpring Enterprises, a fast-growing Internet provider  
based in Atlanta that increasingly relies on a temp agency to 
supply a stream of workers for its call-in centers. But the company 
is careful to offer them staff jobs -- or replace them after 90 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	A closely watched court battle between Microsoft Corp. and its  
longtime temps -- dubbed ``permatemps'' -- is the most visible sign 
of this growing workplace issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. appeals court panel ruled in mid-May that thousands of  
former temps should have been allowed to join the company's 
lucrative stock-purchase program. Microsoft has asked the full 
appeals court to review the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was the first to hold that temps can look to both  
their agency and their work-site employer for benefits. It raises 
the specter that employers will be liable for everything from 
temps' benefits to their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It) is another reminder ... that they just can't change the  
label or badge and turn them into a non-employee,'' said Catherine 
Ruckelshaus, litigation director at the National Employment Law 
Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, the percentage of temps has quadrupled to 2.2  
percent of all workers, according to forthcoming data from the 
Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. On 
any given day, about 1.3 million temps are at work, spawning an 
estimated $60 billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 90 percent of U.S. companies use temps, often because they  
provide a flexible, quick and cheap source of labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Temps, who are mostly women, are clustered in low-paying work,  
such as secretarial jobs, and most would prefer a permanent job. 
Few get health insurance or other benefits from their agencies, 
according to EPI studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft temps have filed a number of lawsuits against the  
company. Along with the suit seeking stock-purchase rights, the 
temps are suing for health insurance and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach said temp agency employees should  
look to their agencies for wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that Microsoft employees work for Microsoft  
and employees of temp agencies work for temp agencies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many employers aren't so sure that the lines of  
responsibility are clear anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some courts have defined a ``common-law employee'' as a worker  
who's spent more than five months at a company, substantially under 
the employers' control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get calls regularly on this issue, asking `How do we make  
this determination?''' said Michael Bartlett, manager of labor law 
policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``There are serious 
liability concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, companies are tightening contracts to more clearly  
exclude temps from benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have established internal ``temp agencies'' that assign  
roving permanent workers to different projects. Others have leased 
some of their operations to outside firms rather than bringing in 
temps. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring, the Internet provider, reluctantly began using temps  
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so antithetical to our philosophy of how a good company  
operates,'' said vice president Carter Calle, explaining that 
MindSpring wants to rely on permanent employees who have a stake in 
the company due to stock options and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now MindSpring uses a staffing agency to recruit, screen and  
hire temps, then -- to prevent ``permatemping'' -- makes sure they're 
either hired or let go after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Temp agencies, as well, should do more for their workers,  
advocacy groups say. A coalition of such groups, including the 
national working women's group 9 to 5, will unveil a national code 
of conduct for temp agencies in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to raise the bar, and improve practices through  
voluntary action,'' said Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the coalition is helping a community group  
monitor the industry, with plans to publicize model temp agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a strategy applauded by Kamal Larsuel, a 29-year-old  
engineer who's been working as a Microsoft temp for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft needs to put their foot down and say, `If you want  
to be a preferred agency with Microsoft, you need to provide us 
with better benefits,''' she said. ``That would be the smart thing 
to do.''

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorean Family Mourned in Conn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- Mourners filed into a Mormon church today  
for the funeral of a woman and her four sons who died in a train 
accident, with the boys remembered for the way they lived, rather 
than their tragic deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw them sad or angry,'' said family friend Maria  
Sanchez. ``They always had a smile ... that would enlighten every 
one of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 people turned out at the Church of Jesus Christ of  
Latter-day Saints to say goodbye to Julia Toledo de Urgiles, 47, 
and Carlos, 11, Jose, 10, Angel, 6, and Pedro, 3. 
</P>
<P>
	They were struck from behind by an Amtrak train in Fairfield as  
they walked across a railroad trestle in the middle of the night 
last week. Mrs. Urgiles, Pedro, Angel and Carlos were killed 
instantly. Jose was declared brain-dead two days after the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after emigrating from Ecuador, Mrs. Urgiles and her  
boys had been living in a homeless shelter. The night of the 
accident, she had packed up her family and left. It was still 
unclear Monday why she left. 
</P>
<P>
	The coffin bearing Carlos' body, who was due to receive an award  
for a school anti-drug program, had a Drug and Alcohol Resistance 
Education T-shirt draped over it. 
</P>
<P>
	White sashes on three flower arrangements near the front of the  
church had the word ``Classmates'' embossed in gold lettering. A 
young friend's handmade card carried the message, ``Jose We Love 
You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among several messages written on the coffins in Spanish and  
English was this: ``I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Urgiles' estranged husband, Carlos Luis Urgiles, stood  
somberly in the church, accepting condolences from the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgiles, an Ecuadorean farm laborer, came to the United States  
intending to take the bodies back to their homeland for burial. But 
after a weekend meeting with her family, he decided to bury them in 
Connecticut. He shared a front pew with his wife's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very bad because I didn't get a chance to speak to them  
before their death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Urgiles, who is Roman Catholic, left the United States more than  
a year ago after fighting over religious differences with his 
sister-in-law, who is Mormon. His wife, who filed for divorce after 
he left, attended both churches.

<HEADLINE> All-Male Batch of Mice Cloned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Scientists have cloned three identical mice using ordinary cells  
rather than DNA extracted from the female reproductive system -- and 
this time, the cloned rodents were male. 
</P>
<P>
	The clones grew using genetic material extracted from tail cells  
of adult male mice, but only one grew to adulthood, according to a 
study by Hawaiian researchers in the June issue of the journal 
Nature Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said the experiment demonstrates that cloning can be  
accomplished with the genetic material contained in the nucleus of 
somatic cells, or ordinary cells found throughout the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, most cloning experiments -- from mice to Dolly the  
sheep -- used DNA extracted from female reproductive cells. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the Hawaii team reported cloning more than 50  
carbon-copy female mice extending at least three generations. The 
DNA used in that experiment was derived from cumulus cells, which 
surround developing eggs in the ovaries of female mice. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists said somatic cells are more plentiful and large  
amounts of their genetic material could be frozen and stored for 
later use. 
</P>
<P>
	That would help to make cloning a more efficient procedure in  
agriculture and commercial laboratory operations. It also might 
help conservationists rescue endangered species by enabling them to 
stockpile more of the genes of rare animals for cloning. 
</P>
<P>
	Other scientists said the cloning of male mice from tail cells  
was not a remarkable achievement. For example, bulls have been 
cloned using DNA from ear samples. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problems the Hawaii team encountered with mice  
eventually could improve the cloning of a variety of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got a beautiful model for looking at these defects  
and how we might solve them,'' said geneticist James Robl of the 
University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mice experiment, researchers engineered 274 embryos by  
emptying eggs of their genetic material and adding the cloned DNA 
from the tail cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The embryos were implanted in female mice for development. In  
all but three cases, the resulting fetuses died. Two of the 
surviving mice died within an hour of birth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawaii researchers said the problems were the result of  
incomplete DNA communication between cells in the placenta and the 
fetus following the cloning procedure. Why that happened has not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Robl said similar problems have complicated calf cloning  
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers said the Hawaii research is promising because  
it suggests that ordinary cells can be used in cloning, and 
identical animals of either sex can be commercially engineered.

<HEADLINE> Baffert's Tale of Two Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The colt is called Buddynamedme. The  
filly's name is Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	They are owned by Mike Pegram and trained by Bob Baffert, and  
they are at opposite ends of racing's pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
	The colt's a ``club fighter.'' The filly's a champion.  
</P>
<P>
	Both horses galloped Monday at Churchill Downs while Pegram and  
Baffert talked about what happened on Feb. 11 at Santa Anita and 
what they hope will happen Saturday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On that February day, Buddynamedme went to the post as the  
favorite in a 6 1/2-furlong race for horses with a $62,500 claiming 
price. The winner on a disqualification was Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Both colts, neither of them claimed, ended up in Louisville,  
where Buddynamedme won an allowance race during Kentucky Derby week 
and Charismatic won the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the D. Wayne Lukas-trained Charismatic will be  
flown to New York, where he will try to become the first Triple 
Crown champion in 21 years by winning Saturday's Belmont. On the 
plane with him will a would-be spoiler -- Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining at Churchill Downs will be Buddynamedme, whose racing  
future lies in allowance and high-priced claiming races. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic and Silverbulleday both were scheduled to have their  
final serious workouts for the Belmont on Tuesday at Churchill 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, who has won 11 of 12 starts, all against  
fillies, also was entered in the Derby and Preakness, but was 
scratched when 20 horses were entered in the Derby and when she 
drew the outside No. 14 post in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no change of heart this time, says Baffert.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a shot,'' he said. ``The bottom line is there is  
only one guy I have to worry about and that's Mike Pegram, and he 
wants to run in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win the Belmont,'' added Baffert, who finished  
second with Silver Charm in 1997 and again with Real Quiet last 
year. The defeats cost both colts the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	After Silverbulletday did not run in the Preakness, Baffert  
said, Jerry Bailey told him if she ran in the Belmont he wanted to 
ride her. The filly's regular jockey, Gary Stevens, is now riding 
in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy who talked me into it is Jerry Bailey,'' Baffert said.  
``He thinks she has a great chance, that she has the right style 
and you can do anything you want with her. One thing about Bailey 
is if she can't handle it, he won't use her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot of racing people think Silverbulletday is the best  
3-year-old in training, and she should be one of the three top 
betting choices with Charismatic and Menifee, second in both the 
Derby and Preakness, in what shapes up as a 12-horse field for the 
1 1/2-mile classic. Entries will be taken and post positions drawn on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert and Pegram said they are not worried about the size of  
the field or Silverbulletday's post position because of the 
distance of the race and size of the Belmont Park oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Belmont is a different race,'' Baffert said. ``You have  
time to get into position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Should Silverbulletday win, she would be only the third filly  
and the first since Tanya in 1905 to win the Belmont. Charismatic 
would be the 12th Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert was asked what he would have said if he had been told by  
someone after that claiming race Feb. 11 that Charismatic was going 
to win the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have claimed him,'' Baffert replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Other Belmont probables include Adonis, 17th in the Derby and  
fifth in the Preakness; Stephen Got Even, 14th in the Derby and 
fourth in the Preakness; Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the Derby; and 
Patience Game, fifth in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Five horses will be making their debuts in Triple Crown  
competition: Best of Luck, winner of the Peter Pan; Vision and 
Verse, the Illinois Derby winner; Prime Directive, the Illinois 
Derby runner-up; Pineaff, third in the Illinois Derby; and 
Teletable.

	Albania Border Security Deteriorates  
</P>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Serb gunners pounded Kosovo guerrillas  
along the Albanian border today and U.S. armor-busting A-10 jets 
countered with strikes against the Serbs. NATO flew its largest 
number of sorties in the border crossing area of Morini, nearly 
hitting the Serb border checkpoint. The jets swooped in to attack 
the Serbs, who shot back with anti-aircraft fire and shoulder-fired 
missiles. With the United States refusing to deploy Apache 
helicopters, the relatively low-flying A-10s are regarded as the 
most effective warplane against tanks and entrenched positions. 
With the guerrillas mounting new operations, security along 
Albania's border with Kosovo has deteriorated sharply in recent 
days, a U.N. spokesman said.

	Six Croats Exonerated of War Crimes  
</P>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A local court found insufficient evidence  
today to convict six former Croat soldiers of wartime atrocities 
against rebel Serbs. The trial was the first in which Croats, who 
largely view themselves as victims of Serb aggression during 
Croatia's 1991-92 war, set out to try their own for crimes 
perpetrated against minority Serbs. All six defendants had faced 
charges of extortion, abduction, attempted murder and murder in the 
deaths of at least 14 ethnic Serbs during Croatia's war with rebel 
minority Serbs.

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiations between the Teamsters and  
new-car haulers today edged toward a midnight strike deadline in 
the first test for union president James P. Hoffa. A strike could 
mean longer waits for hot-selling vehicles and leave manufacturing 
plants without spaces to park vehicles coming off the assembly 
line. Faced with a threatened strike beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT, 
talks stalled over management proposals that would establish a 
lower pay scale for newly hired drivers and permit hiring of 
part-time workers, spokesmen for both sides said.

	Organ-Rejection Remedy Tested  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A temporary treatment to block organ rejection  
has remained effective for up to a year in monkeys that received 
new kidneys, researchers report. Scientists hope the treatment will 
one day free transplant patients from taking anti-rejection drugs 
for the rest of their lives. The drugs suppress the immune system 
and leave patients vulnerable to infections. The new treatment 
teaches the immune system to accept transplanted tissue rather than 
attack it. Researchers injected the monkeys with a protein to 
prevent certain blood cells from delivering a ``danger'' signal to 
other cells, an initial event in rejection.

	Nevada Bill Would Allow Spanking  
</P>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The Legislature sent Gov. Kenny Guinn a  
bill that would ensure parents can spank their children and erase 
official records of such incidents if they're not deemed to be 
abuse. The Assembly voted 24-17 yesterday in favor of the bill, 
which was approved by the Senate a day earlier. Parents need to 
know they won't get locked up for disciplining their children, 
supporters of the measure said. But critics argued that a record is 
vital to identifying abusive parents.

Padres today. Nomo (2-1), released by the New York Mets and Chicago 
Cubs earlier this season, has a 2.41 ERA in five starts since being 
signed by the Brewers. After giving up two runs in a 39-pitch first 
inning, Nomo settled down. He allowed a leadoff single to Ruben 
Rivera in the second and then retired the next 15 batters.

<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Virginia won the NCAA Division I  
lacrosse final 12-10 today, surviving a fourth-quarter scoring 
binge by Syracuse that brought back memories of last year's title 
game. In 1998, Syracuse made up a six-goal deficit to beat 
Virginia. This time, the comeback by the Orangemen fell short. 
Conor Gill and Henry Oakey scored in a 21-second span to put 
Virginia up by three with 2:38 remaining, and the Cavaliers won 
their first title since 1972.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Chief To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippines' respected central  
bank chief, Gabriel Singson, said Monday he will step down as 
scheduled, quashing speculation that he might agree to an extension 
of his six-year term, which ends July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada had earlier said he was willing to  
prolong Singson's term if the central bank governor would agree. 
Singson was one of the few officials appointed by former President 
Fidel Ramos retained by Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
	Singson said he considers his ``most important accomplishments''  
as central bank governor a stable price regime and a stable 
financial system that has weathered the Asian crisis largely 
unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
	His six-year term also saw a stable peso, moderate inflation,  
and the ballooning of the central bank's gross international 
reserves to a record high this month of $13.9 billion, enough to 
cover five months' of imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Singson, who is 70, said he plans to spend more time playing  
golf and with his wife and three children.

<HEADLINE> Brack Takes $1.4M From Indy Purse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Kenny Brack saw Arie Luyendyk walking toward  
him. He broke into a big smile, shook his head and asked the 
question Luyendyk probably asked himself a hundred times. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the hell were you thinking of? You had that race in your  
pocket. ... I mean, you were fast,'' Brack said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but it was good racing, eh?'' Luyendyk replied as the  
two drivers chatted backstage before the Indianapolis 500 Victory 
Celebration on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack, who went on to the checkered flag after Robby Gordon ran  
out of fuel with just over a lap to go, took home $1.47 million 
from a purse of $9.05 million, the biggest prize package in auto 
racing history. Luyendyk, who wound up 22nd, had to settle for 
$382,350, not a bad piece of change under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Luyendyk seemed most likely to get the  
congratulations, not to mention the heaviest paycheck. He started 
from the pole position, led much of the early going and appeared 
almost untouchable on the track. Then, as he admitted later, he 
made a bonehead move, trying a risky pass on the inside of Tyce 
Carlson. 
</P>
<P>
	What he didn't know was Carlson's radio was out, meaning Carlson  
was not in contact with his spotter and wasn't warned of Luyendyk's 
approach. When Carlson lifted off the throttle in the turn, 
Luyendyk had to tap his brakes to avoid a collision, and that was 
enough to send his car into a slide that ended against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have done it with you, I don't think,'' Brack said.  
``That's a bold move. But it was good racing, it really was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also was the 15th and final Indy 500 for Luyendyk, a two-time  
winner who earlier announced he would retire after this race. And 
as the Flying Dutchman walked toward the stage, where drivers were 
getting ready to be introduced, he turned to the young Swede and 
said, ``I'm happy for you, man. I'm glad you won the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk still holds a lot of Indy records -- including speeds in  
practice, qualifications and the race. He also has won more money 
than any other driver at Indy -- almost $5.6 million -- and two years 
ago set a record with $1,568,150 for his second victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack's $1,465,190 is the second-biggest prize in the 83-year  
Indy history. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is absolutely unbelievable,'' said Brack, the 1998 Indy  
Racing League series champion whose previous high was $310,750 for 
sixth place in last year's Indy 500. ``This is the world's biggest 
race, so it should have the world's biggest purse. They're huge 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Ward, who finished second to Brack, earned $583,150; Billy  
Boat, Brack's teammate, took home $435,200 for third; Gordon 
received $253,270 for fourth, and Robby McGehee, who was named Indy 
500 rookie of the year, earned $247,750 for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best day of my life in the sense of everything I  
ever dreamed about as a child. It means everything,'' McGehee said. 
``I looked at the list earlier today of who else has been rookie of 
the year, and all of them have gone on to fabulous motor sports 
careers. If I can follow in their footsteps, that's all I ever want 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee's chief mechanic, Steve Fried, was critically injured in  
a pit accident early in the race. McGehee dedicated his rookie of 
the year trophy to Fried. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack, meanwhile, said his victory still hasn't sunk in.  
</P>
<P>
	``Since yesterday, I've been going flat out doing interviews and  
all kinds of things. It'll probably take a few more weeks until it 
sinks in completely, if it ever will,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack won three races on the way to his IRL championship last  
year. Still, he remained a virtual unknown to most of this country 
-- until Sunday. And winning at Indy, as his car owner A.J. Foyt has 
always said, can make any driver famous. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can, if you keep winning as many as he did,'' Brack said of  
his boss, the first four-time Indy winner. ``For me, I'm not really 
bothered by that right now. I want to win. That's why I race. I 
want to win every race I take part in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I prepared a long time for Indy,'' he said. ``After  
we won the championship last year, I told A.J., `Next year, I want 
to win the Indy 500 for you, and if you give me the car I can do 
it.' Since then, I have prepared mentally, physically, as hard as I 
could ever prepare for a race. I've done it. It's a great relief to 
come through and make the win.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Police suspected arson today in an apartment fire  
that killed two children, their mother and their grandmother. Two 
people were critically burned. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Pat Camden said dogs detected accelerant in the  
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Juanita Jones, 5; Jackie Jones,  
6; Gloria Jones, 32; and Juanita Jones, 53. The Rev. Paul Jakes, 
who counseled surviving family members, said Gloria was the mother 
of the two children, and the elder Juanita Jones was her mother. 
</P>
<P>
	An unidentified man and woman were in critical condition with  
burns and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby Ervin, a tenant in the apartment building, said she was  
asleep when she heard an explosion around 3 a.m. and then smoke 
detectors went off. She woke up her grandchildren, but when she 
opened her door there was a wall of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put a wet towel over my face and I just followed the sound

<HEADLINE> China Tries To Disprove Theft Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Seeking to disprove allegations that it stole  
U.S. weapons secrets, China's government took reporters on a tour 
of the Internet today to show that data about America's nuclear 
arsenal is freely available. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhao Qizheng, the government's top spokesman, said the power,  
weight, dimensions and other details of the seven types of U.S. 
nuclear weapons China was alleged to have stolen were openly 
published in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	More data, including information on the most sophisticated U.S.  
warhead, the W-88, ``can easily be found on the Internet,'' Zhao 
said at a news conference. ``They are no longer secrets, so there 
is nothing to steal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. congressional committee on Chinese espionage concluded in  
a report released last week that China stole secrets about the 
seven major warheads in the American nuclear arsenal during a 
20-year spying effort that the commission said most likely 
continues today. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhao said China was ``strongly indignant over this groundless,  
fictitious, conflicting and fabricated attack that fabricates facts 
and confuses black and white.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While acknowledging that China has made great use of publicly  
available data, the congressional commission, headed by Rep. 
Christopher Cox, charged that Beijing stole ``classified'' 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhao said the Cox report used ``terms of conjecture such as  
`seemingly,' `presumably,' `if,' `perhaps,' `probably,' `likely' 
and `perhaps in future,''' but offered no substantive evidence that 
China stole sensitive technology and threatened U.S. security. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is utterly absurd. This sensational conclusion does not  
hold water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeating earlier Chinese denunciations, Zhao concluded that the  
report's release was timed to distract public attention from NATO's 
accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was also an attempt to ``fan up anti-China feelings,  
smear China's image and try to hold back Sino-U.S. relations so as 
to contain China's development,'' Zhao said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those attempts are doomed to fail,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Burn in Southeast, West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As federal and state firefighters contained a California  
wildfire that threatened delicate habitat near the Mojave Desert, 
crews in Arizona battled their own lightning-sparked blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, a 40,000-acre fire charred swampland and crossed the  
state line into Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, more than 900 forestry officials and local  
firefighters at Joshua Tree National Park quelled wildfires Sunday 
that had burned more than 13,000 acres of the fragile desert 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began with two lightning strikes, setting off four  
fires. Two burned less than one acre, another burned about 1,900 
acres, and the biggest consumed roughly 11,200 acres. Firefighters 
struggled against high winds, snakes, scorpions and old mineshafts 
as they fought the flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Mop-up work and rehabilitation is expected to take about two  
days, including dousing spot fires and raking out any tire tracks 
left during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've adapted our firefighting techniques to tread very  
lightly on the terrain,'' said San Bernardino County fire Capt. Jim 
Wilkins. ``We never drove off the road, we kept our aircraft out of 
(river) areas, we did almost everything by hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northwestern Arizona, a fire burning oily brush, junipers and  
pinion trees grew to 10,000 acres Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread the fire in an area  
between the Arizona-Utah border and Grand Canyon National Park 
known as the Arizona Strip, Interagency Fire Center spokeswoman 
Bette Arial said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers rushed their livestock along narrow dirt roads, and  
officials ordered parkgoers to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	A second wildfire about 80 miles west of Phoenix consumed 14,000  
acres by Sunday but was 25 percent contained, said Bureau of Land 
Management spokesman Wendell Peacock. 
</P>
<P>
	In Florida, a 40,000-acre wildfire burned through portions of  
the Okefenokee swamp and hopped the Florida-Georgia line. The fire 
raged into an area south of the small town of Fargo, Ga., about 
eight miles north of the Florida line, said Gene Madden, spokesman 
for the Florida Division of Forestry.

<HEADLINE> Sterilization Drug, Malaria Fighter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A drug with a disputed safety record as a  
female sterilization agent has been used by millions of people 
around the world since its introduction in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	Quinacrine hydrochloride, also called Atabrine, was administered  
orally to millions of U.S. troops and sailors in the South Pacific 
during World War II to fight malaria and other parasitic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	When used to sterilize women, pellets of the drug are inserted  
into the uterus near the fallopian tubes. The chemical dissolves 
and burns the tubes' lining. Blockage from the resulting scar 
tissue prevents pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	The no-anesthesia method can be temporarily painful and, because  
there's no way to check how much of the tubes are blocked, women 
cannot be sure the procedure worked as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug's failure rate has been variously estimated at less  
than one in 10 or one in 20. While not as surefire as surgery, 
quinacrine is effective and so cheap even some of the world's 
poorest women can afford it, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is frighteningly good,'' said Dr. Michael Benjamin, a  
Tamarac, Fla., gynecologist eager to use the chemical to sterilize 
women in South Florida. ``There is nothing available today in the 
world of contraception that gives as big a bang for the buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Family planning researchers also are trying to find ways to  
block the fallopian tubes with clips, gels, plugs and adhesives. 
No-scalpel vasectomies using scar-causing chemicals are also being 
tested. None is as widely used or studied as quinacrine, or as 
readily available. 
</P>
<P>
	Female surgical sterilization is the world's most common method  
of family planning. But in the world's poorest countries, where 
even basic medical care is strained, providing long-term, 
dependable sterilization to women who want it cannot be met with 
surgical methods, family planning experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization estimates about 585,000 woman die  
in childbirth annually. The WHO also estimates about 78,000 deaths 
a year are due to unsafe abortions.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Hotel Implosion Goes Awry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The demolition of a downtown hotel went as  
planned -- almost. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of buckling in as intended Sunday, the fourth-floor  
buckled out when the building imploded, sending debris flying. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured in the explosion-triggered collapse of the  
Waldorf Towers. But a movie theater was damaged, streets were 
blocked by debris, overhead power lines for electric buses were 
knocked down and at least two street lights and a traffic signal 
were wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials had no immediate estimate of the cost of the damage.  
</P>
<P>
	The Waldorf had been rigged by Engineered Demolition of Hayden,  
Idaho, to collapse within its site -- about one-sixth of a block in 
size -- following detonation of 175 explosives loaded into the 
seven-story structure. 
</P>
<P>
	But something went awry.  
</P>
<P>
	``The fourth floor buckled out,'' said Doug Hazelrigs,  
construction manager for R.C. Hedreen Co. of Seattle which oversaw 
the project. ``The fourth and sixth floors were cabled to buckle 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Engineered Demolition officials were meeting with Cineplex  
representatives Sunday and could not be contacted. No one answered 
the phone at the company's office in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	The implosion saved about three weeks in clearing the site for a  
five-star hotel with 550 rooms and a 990-space parking garage to 
accompany an expansion of the Washington State Trade &AMP; Convention 
Center.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Spreading in Dry Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Fla. (AP) -- Weary firefighters using tanker helicopters  
and planes struggled against a huge fire in the Okefenokee Swamp of 
northern Florida and southern Georgia on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could cause the fire to spread further.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a war zone,'' said Bill Paxton, a spokesman for  
the firefighting operation. ``We've got helicopters and tanker 
planes sweeping in for runs over the fire. We've got dozens of 
bulldozers and fire engines going and coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some real close calls -- fire crews barely making it  
over burning bridges that are the only way in and out of areas. 
Then there's the snakes. Again, some close calls. No one bitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had burned 53,000 acres by Monday night. It was  
believed to have been started by lightning May 21. The swamp is 
surrounded by fire lines from previous years, and no homes were 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread a fire over  
11,000 acres between the Arizona-Utah line and Grand Canyon 
National Park. Another lightning wildfire 80 miles west of Phoenix 
burned 14,600 acres but was contained by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in Nevada called in reinforcements to help battle a  
blaze that had charred 10,000 acres in rugged terrain about 85 
miles northeast of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's Joshua Tree National Park, a 13,900-acre  
wildfire was contained as crews started work on restoring the 
fragile desert habitat blackened by the blaze, which also was 
started by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 firefighters were involved in the Florida-Georgia  
fire, and volunteer crews and equipment had come in from 30 states, 
including Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Espionage Could Cost Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says he will  
fire or demote Energy Department officials whose incompetence led 
to the Chinese obtaining secrets from nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, Congress should concentrate on  
finding solutions rather than laying blame for the security 
breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said Sunday he will take disciplinary action after  
receiving a report, probably this week, on security problems at the 
Los Alamos, N.M., nuclear weapons lab, a prime target of the 
alleged Chinese grab for American secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were communications breakdowns, there were incompetent  
acts, security was not considered important,'' said Richardson, who 
appeared on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' and ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a case ``of anything nefarious,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has been criticized for being slow in  
removing the security clearance and monitoring the computers of Wen 
Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist fired in March under suspicion he 
passed secrets to the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's counterintelligence chief, Edward Curran, said  
on ABC's ``This Week'' that Congress failed to follow up on FBI 
warnings in 1997 that the labs were in danger of losing secrets to 
the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the FBI ``made some very, very significant proposals''  
on tightening security at the labs to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., 
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. ``And I never heard 
anything since.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curren said there were 26 recommendations on improving security,  
as well as a request that Congress provide $12.5 million to begin 
putting the new precautions in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The department later adopted those recommendations, but ``it  
would have been nice to have a head start,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby, appearing later on the same show, said Curran was ``out  
of bounds in some areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that in 1996, the intelligence committee, then chaired  
by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., did respond to counterintelligence 
problems at the labs and provided additional money. But he said the 
department ignored the committee's advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., another critic of the  
administration's handling of the spy case, said Curran's comments 
were ``entirely inappropriate.'' He said it was improper for an FBI 
official dealing with counterintelligence ``to engage in a game of 
blame between the Congress and the executive branch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the focus should be on tightening security at  
the labs rather than placing blame for past mistakes. ``Let's stop 
scapegoating, looking for heads to roll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed with Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chief author of  
the report released last week detailing Chinese efforts to obtain 
U.S. nuclear secrets, that the espionage was serious. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said China stole secrets about the seven major  
warheads in the current U.S. nuclear arsenal as well as the neutron 
bomb, adding that the thefts ``almost certainly continue to the 
present.'' China has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said it was certain the Chinese got information on  
three nuclear warheads, but there is no hard evidence they have 
used that information to modernize or deploy nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox agreed it's not clear what the Chinese are doing with the  
American technology. But, he said, ``diminishing the problem, 
saying it's really not that bad, is actually an obstacle to fixing 
the problem.''

<HEADLINE>  Ocalan Offers Rebel Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Begging and bargaining for his  
life, Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan declared at the opening 
of his treason trial Monday that Turkey would have peace if it 
spared him the gallows -- and warned that ``hundreds of thousands 
will die'' if it did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking through a microphone in a bulletproof and bombproof  
cage in a converted movie theater, Ocalan directed his fighters to 
give up their armed struggle. He offered to arrange their outright 
surrender if he was allowed to contact them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The armed clashes should immediately cease and arms should  
immediately be laid down,'' Ocalan declared. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first direct call to abandon the 15-year-old  
guerrilla campaign for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The 
war has claimed 37,000 victims, mostly Kurds. Ocalan called for a 
cease-fire in the struggle in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``For peace and brotherhood I am ready to serve the Turkish  
state, and I believe that for this end I must remain alive,'' 
Ocalan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will happen if I die?'' the rebel chief asked. ``The  
organization will send out thousands of fighters, and hundreds of 
thousands of people will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is widely expected to be convicted and sentenced to hang.  
An overwhelming majority of Turks hold him responsible for all the 
deaths in the conflict, and there is strong support for his 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was Ocalan's first public appearance since he was brought  
to Imrali following his February capture by Turkish commandos in 
Kenya. The stocky guerrilla leader seemed thinner, but healthy. He 
appeared calm but spoke hesitantly, gesturing frequently with his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the court he had not been tortured or mistreated.  
</P>
<P>
	The guerrilla leader, who tolerated no dissent within his rebel  
organization, appeared conciliatory Monday, asking the families of 
the 5,000 Turkish soldiers slain in the war to forgive him for 
their deaths.

as a tactic to avoid the death penalty or if it was another step in 
his effort to transform his faltering military struggle and

</P>
<P>
	Turkey regards any hint of Kurdish nationalism as a threat to  
the state's existence. It has ignored several cease-fires called by 
Ocalan's PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, and has brushed aside his 
calls to negotiate a political solution to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey maintains 250,000 soldiers and police in the largely

<HEADLINE>  Ocalan Offers Rebel Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Begging and bargaining for his  
life, Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan declared at the opening 
of his treason trial Monday that Turkey would have peace if it 
spared him the gallows -- and warned that ``hundreds of thousands 
will die'' if it did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking through a microphone in a bulletproof and bombproof  
cage in a converted movie theater, Ocalan directed his fighters to 
give up their armed struggle. He offered to arrange their outright 
surrender if he was allowed to contact them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The armed clashes should immediately cease and arms should  
immediately be laid down,'' Ocalan declared. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first direct call to abandon the 15-year-old  
guerrilla campaign for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The 
war has claimed 37,000 victims, mostly Kurds. Ocalan called for a 
cease-fire in the struggle in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``For peace and brotherhood I am ready to serve the Turkish  
state, and I believe that for this end I must remain alive,'' 
Ocalan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will happen if I die?'' the rebel chief asked. ``The  
organization will send out thousands of fighters, and hundreds of 
thousands of people will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is widely expected to be convicted and sentenced to hang.  
An overwhelming majority of Turks hold him responsible for all the 
deaths in the conflict, and there is strong support for his 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was Ocalan's first public appearance since he was brought  
to Imrali following his February capture by Turkish commandos in 
Kenya. The stocky guerrilla leader seemed thinner, but healthy. He 
appeared calm but spoke hesitantly, gesturing frequently with his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the court he had not been tortured or mistreated.  
</P>
<P>
	The guerrilla leader, who tolerated no dissent within his rebel  
organization, appeared conciliatory Monday, asking the families of 
the 5,000 Turkish soldiers slain in the war to forgive him for 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share the sorrow of the martyrs' relatives deep in my  
heart,'' Ocalan said, facing the families. ``I apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shameful!'' an angry mother shouted back.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO pursued its heavy bombing  
campaign today while pressing Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic to 
accept a Kosovo peace plan. The NATO strikes reportedly hit a 
sanitarium and a retirement home, killing civilians. The state-run 
Tanjug news agency said at least 11 people died in the hits in 
Surdulica, 155 miles southeast of Belgrade. The report could not be

	MUDANYA, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan  
pleaded for his life and declared himself ready to cooperate with 
the Turkish state for peace and brotherhood today at the opening of 
his trial. For 15 years, Ocalan's guerrillas have battled Turkish 
soldiers in the barren mountains of southeastern Turkey, fighting 
for the Kurdish people and their right to self-determination. But 
the battle now facing the iron-fisted leader of the of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, is in the courtroom, where he sat 
behind bulletproof and bombproof glass to defend himself against 
treason charges.

	TYRE, Lebanon (AP) -- A U.N. peacekeeper was killed and another  
wounded today in a battle between Israeli forces and Lebanese 
guerrillas in south Lebanon. The two peacekeepers, both Irish 
soldiers, were hit when two mortar rounds exploded inside their 
position before dawn near Braachit village, six miles north of the 
Israeli border, said Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-member 
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. He said the mortar that hit the 
soldiers had been shot by Israel's proxy militia.

underground passage that left 54 dead, mostly young women, 
officials said today. More than 100 people were also injured late 
yesterday and 37 were in ``grave condition,'' Health Minister Igor

	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The state prosecutor questioned the  
eldest daughter of Indonesia's ex-President Suharto today for eight 
hours in connection with allegations that the former first family 
has amassed a fortune abroad. The government has come under heavy 
pressure to prosecute Suharto and his family, and the new 
questioning comes as the ruling party has been slipping in the 
polls less than a week ahead of June 7 elections. Siti Hardiyanti 
Rukmana, social minister in Suharto's final Cabinet and better 
known as Tutut, said after the questioning that most of it involved 
an article on the Suharto family's purported wealth published two 
weeks ago in Time magazine's Asian edition. She said most of the 
article was untrue.

Sunday evening. Inside the Russian-built Zarya control module, 
Tokarev and Canadian astronaut Julie Payette pulled up the floor 
and began swapping out electrical meters on batteries that aren't 
charging properly.Astronauts Rick Husband and Daniel Barry replaced 
two electronics boxes for a communication system inside the

<HEADLINE> Luyendyk Crashes in Final Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Arie Luyendyk tapped the brakes and spun out  
of control. Amid the smoke from burning rubber, he slammed backward 
into the third-turn wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly the way the Flying Dutchman wanted to end his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 15th and final appearance in the Indianapolis 500,  
Luyendyk seemed to have everything going his way. He started from 
the pole, leading 63 laps, ready to enjoy his retirement as a 
three-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he got careless. Maybe a little greedy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say to myself, `Why did I make a move like that?'''  
he asked. ``I really feel stupid right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, in the lead after 117 of the 200 laps, made a move to  
the inside to pass Tyce Carlson. When Carlson eased off the 
throttle, Luyendyk had no room and as his right front wheel drew 
even with Carlson's left rear tire, the Dutchman's G Force Aurora 
began to wobble and shake. 
</P>
<P>
	In a matter of seconds, it was over. Luyendyk touched the  
brakes, spun around backward and hit the wall. He wound up 22nd, 
his worst finish at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for going out like John Elway or Michael Jordan in this  
year of the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a trip to Victory Lane for a swig of milk, Luyendyk  
took a humbling golf cart ride back to the garage to mull his fate. 
A huge ovation from the crowd seemed to ease his anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got out of the car, the crowd was going nuts,'' he  
said. ``I was trying to take it all in. It's been great throughout 
the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-year-old driver, who first won in 1990 and added a second  
Indy victory in 1997, announced before the Indy Racing League 
season that this would be his final ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500, where he holds almost every speed record and has won  
more money than any other driver, was his only race this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the best car here today that I've ever had,'' he said.  
``The car gave me so much confidence. It was too good to be true, 
and this was probably part of my demise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the crash, Luyendyk climbed from the battered car and  
peered down as if he couldn't comprehend what had happened. As he 
walked toward the infield grass, he slapped his right glove on the 
hood of the red safety truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have known better than to be racing the traffic that  
hard,'' he said. ``I probably just got too relaxed out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk felt he was crowded a bit in the turn by Carlson,  
forcing him to tap the brakes and send his car skidding into the 
wall. Television replays seemed to show the blame clearly belonged 
to the more experienced driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault,'' Luyendyk conceded. ``I was the guy making  
the pass. There's no excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson's radio went out during the race, which meant he  
couldn't communicate with his trackside spotters as Luyendyk 
approached. But the 28-year-old driver saw the approaching car in 
his mirror and tried to make room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even went off the throttle,'' Carlson said. ``Arie's a great  
guy, and I never would have gotten in his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk wavered a bit when asked if he might change his mind  
about retiring, but that was merely the competitor in the man 
showing through. He's looking forward to spending time with his 
family, in addition to working as a television analyst on IRL 
events and assisting the Treadway Racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stick with my plan,'' he said. ``I'll be back  
here next year in another capacity and enjoy the race. ... But I 
know when I come back next year, I'll start kicking myself again 
for what happened here today.''

<HEADLINE> Little-Remembered Man Donates $377K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHILTON, Wis. (AP) -- An 80-year-old man who kept to himself left  
a surprise behind when he died -- $377,000 in donations to a church 
he never joined, fairgrounds he rarely visited and a hospital where 
nobody remembered him. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors and relatives described Randolph Landgraf as a quiet  
person. The World War II veteran died in November after spending 
two years in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very private person and never told us of his plans,''  
said niece Barbara Schmidlkofer of Bonita Springs, Fla., his 
closest surviving relative. ``I guess he wanted to do something for 
the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one came to Landgraf's funeral beside Ms. Schmidlkofer, her  
husband, the funeral director and an accountant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Calumet Medical Center received $94,000, though there's no  
record Landgraf was ever a patient there, said Lea Whitby, the 
hospital's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Martin's Lutheran Church also got $94,000, though he wasn't  
a member. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best we can tell is that he worshipped at our church as a  
young man,'' said the Rev. Wayne Huebner, the pastor. ``Sometimes 
people in small towns do wonderful things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining $189,000 went to the Calumet County Fair Board. No  
one on the board knew the gift was coming, or even knew who 
Landgraf was. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquaintances said Landgraf rarely attended the fair.  
</P>
<P>
	Landgraf's family was once prominent in the town of 4,000, a  
half-hour drive south of Green Bay. His three older brothers died 
before him.

<HEADLINE> Union-Car Hauler Nearing Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiations between the Teamsters and  
new-car haulers today edged toward a midnight strike deadline in 
the first test at the bargaining table for union president James P. 
Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike could mean longer waits for hot-selling vehicles and  
leave manufacturing plants without spaces to park vehicles coming 
off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a threatened strike beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT  
Tuesday, talks stalled over management proposals that would 
establish a lower pay scale for newly hired drivers and permit 
hiring of part-time workers, spokesmen for both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demands for concessions are still on the table,'' Hoffa  
said in an interview as negotiations went into the evening. ``I 
told them these are 'strikable' issues. I made that very clear to 
them.'' Management officials said the proposals are essential to 
meet competition from railroads and non-union haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	The haulers also demanded more flexible work schedules while the  
Teamsters sought boosts in wages and benefits and retirement pay 
for employees retiring after 25 years. The union also wants to 
block the haulers from giving union jobs to Mexican trucking 
companies, something the haulers claimed they have no plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that Hoffa is a factor. The son of legendary  
Teamsters leader James R. Hoffa was elected last December in the 
aftermath of a campaign finance scandal, and personally led the 
union negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important set of talks for Hoffa,'' said union  
spokesman Chip Roth. ``He'll be judged on his ability to deliver 
for the members. He knows the members will be watching him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said in the interview that he felt ``invigorated'' by  
leading the bargaining talks. Asked if the membership was watching 
closely, he said, ``I certainly hope so. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief management negotiator, said Hoffa's personal  
stake in the talks ``can't be discounted as a factor. It's his 
first national contract. Sure, it is a political concern that he 
has. But we're attempting at the table to reduce that as a 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics, yard and  
office workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides dueled publicly over the financial state of the  
unionized car haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth cited the industry's ``record profits,'' adding, ``This is  
not an industry in need.'' Hunter said statements about record 
profits were ``pure propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
Inc., said a strike would have an impact within days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some plants could be affected in a day or two because they'd  
run out of room to park vehicles that are coming off the assembly 
line,'' Healy said. He added that dealers' inventories overall are 
``normal to slightly below normal.'' Roth, the union spokesman, 
said a strike would mean ``people would have to wait for the 
hottest-selling cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Adler of General Motors Corp. said, ``We've got contingency  
plans'' but he did not specify them. He said that during a 
car-haulers strike in 1995, the company allowed dealers to pick up 
cars from factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vella, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co., said only that the  
automaker was ``watching the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne, spokesman for the management negotiators of the  
National Automobile Transporters labor division, said the 17 
companies hauled more than 15 million cars last year. But he 
insisted the revenue-producing miles for car deliveries has 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indicators to show the fiscal health of the companies are  
all downward because of the competition of the non-union trucking 
companies and the railroads,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Duchesne, 71 percent of the new cars now leave the  
manufacturing plant by rail, compared to 29 percent by the union 
carriers. Other competition comes from non-union haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a year in wages and  
benefits, with salaries at $55,000. The Teamsters said that 
management wants to pay newly hired drivers 30 percent less than 
the contract wage, with gradual increases eventually equalizing the 
pay.

<HEADLINE> Former POW Now Ambassador To Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Pete Peterson has plenty of reasons to be  
bitter -- 6 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and the loss of 
his wife and 17-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	But the former congressman who became the first U.S. ambassador  
to Vietnam since the end of the war in 1975 likes to look to the 
future, not the past, and to reconciliation, not hatred. 
</P>
<P>
	His long, emotional journey is the subject of an hourlong  
documentary that premiered before a full house in Hanoi today -- 
Memorial Day in the United States. It will air in America on PBS on 
Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, a former Air Force pilot, was shot down in his F-4  
Phantom on Sept. 10, 1966, while making his 67th bombing run over 
North Vietnam. Of his 6 1/2 years as a POW, three were in the 
notorious ``Hanoi Hilton'' prison where he was tortured and held in 
solitary confinement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled out my .38 revolver ... and suggested to myself that  
maybe it would be easier and less painful if I took the revolver 
and ended my life,'' Peterson says in the film, describing the 
moments after he was forced to bail out and got stuck in a tree, 
knowing he would be taken prisoner soon. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. documentary filmmaker Sandy Northrop begins with Peterson's  
May 9, 1997, arrival in Hanoi, where he was greeted by a handful of 
American businessmen, then flashes back to his years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Using Vietnamese archival footage, Northrop graphically  
illustrates the isolation and pain the POWs suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson explains how they used military codes to tap  
Shakespeare and old film plots to each other on the walls between 
their cells. Even when forced to do chores such as sweep the prison 
yard, the men blinked messages in code at each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Without that contact ``life would have been impossible; you  
would have lost faith, you would have given up,'' Peterson says in 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
	Released in March 1973 with other POWs, Peterson returned to his  
family in Florida, including his son Doug, who was born while he 
was in captivity. Peterson went into business. 
</P>
<P>
	But his troubles had only begun.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Doug died in a car accident. The same year, his wife,  
Carlotta, was diagnosed with breast cancer. She died 10 years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	He won a seat in Congress in 1990, but decided not to seek  
re-election after three terms. He was chosen to return to Hanoi as 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop, who worked on the documentary for almost two years,  
said she was overwhelmed by Peterson's ability to forget the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point you decide, `I will survive or I will die,'''  
Northrop said in an interview at her Hanoi apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you decide that, you've decided the course of your life.  
You just go forward. He hates to look back and wouldn't talk about 
being a POW or the torture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northrop, whose past film work includes documentaries on animal  
life in Africa for National Geographic, said she wanted to show the 
reality of Vietnam today and explain the suffering that Vietnamese 
endured during the war. Much of the focus has been on the 58,000 
Americans who died, not the 3 million Vietnamese fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to humanize the Vietnamese,'' Northrop said.  
``Americans assume they must hate us. But they don't. Coming here, 
at first you don't believe it, but they don't hate us. We are not 
the bad guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The film includes interviews with Pham Kim Hy, whose son is  
among an estimated 300,000 Vietnamese soldiers still listed as 
missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the film's most moving moments, Hy describes making  
four trips to the former Demilitarized Zone to search for her son's 
bones before giving up and simply burying earth in his grave 
outside Hanoi, which she visits every week. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the movie is an attempt to bring Vietnam and the United  
States closer together, the Ministry of Culture threatened to ban 
the premiere, backing down Friday afternoon only after Peterson 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
	They still insisted on some cuts. One scene of a demonstration  
outside the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington was partially blacked 
out to conceal a flag of the former South Vietnam carried by 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please be aware there will be some places in the film where  
there won't be any sound and there won't be any footage. You can 
all guess why,'' U.S. businessman Peter Ryder told the audience of 
400 before Monday's screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the controversy and pain, the film has some happy  
moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson fell in love with Saigon-born Vi Le, now trade  
counselor to the Australian Embassy in Hanoi. Hanoi's Roman 
Catholic cathedral was packed when they were married a year ago in 
what was seen locally as a fairy-tale event of reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Honeybees As Land Mine Detectors? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Honeybees equipped with radio tags no  
larger than a grain of rice may one day be used to detect 
antipersonnel land mines on battlefields and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	As farfetched as it might seem, a collaborative project seeks to  
train and track entire colonies of bees that may be conditioned to 
prefer something other than honey, such as TNT, the primary 
component of land mines. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, it may be possible to carry a hive to a site and  
release the bees to search for explosives or other things, such as 
methamphetamine-making ingredients or nuclear waste, said Ron 
Gilbert, who works on electronic systems at the Pacific Northwest 
National Laboratory here. 
</P>
<P>
	``This system is not unique for land mines,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The project, led by University of Montana entomologist Jerry  
Bromenshenk, depends on several factors -- particularly whether bees 
can smell and be taught to find TNT. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing what you can train a bee to do,'' said UM  
postgraduate student Bob Seccomb, who took part in a media 
demonstration with the bees. ``We've got them flying through 
mazes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Cross estimates there are 80 million to 120 million land  
mines in 70 countries around the world and that 60 people a day are 
killed or maimed by buried mines. In some developing countries, 
thousands of acres of productive land are unusable because they are 
death traps. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bees can indeed be trained to seek out explosives, the  
next step is to find a way to keep track of them. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the radio tags come in. Several years ago, PNNL  
developed a first generation of radio-frequency tags for the 
garment industry to track inventory. The tags are similar to the 
microchips implanted by veterinarians as permanent identification 
for cats and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers brought some 20,000 bees in two hives to  
Richland for three days of tag testing, which ended May 22. 
</P>
<P>
	UM student Jason Volkman carefully glued the tiny tags to the  
bees. To make them easier to work with, he chills the bees in a 
college dormitory-style refrigerator for four minutes, then 
attaches the tags to the bees' abdomens with tweezers. 
</P>
<P>
	The tags have a 10-character code that identifies each bee  
individually. The tags are read by sensitive instruments attached 
to a portable hive which records when the bees leave to forage, the 
direction they go and when they return. 
</P>
<P>
	A special spectrometer would be installed in the hive to  
``sniff'' the bees for the presence of TNT residue. 
</P>
<P>
	Bromenshenk has characterized the bees as ``flying dust mops,''  
picking up samples everywhere they go. Land mines leak small 
amounts of explosives into nearby soil and water, and the TNT 
residue eventually makes its way into some plants. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tag tests, researchers learned that the bees were not  
dissuaded from returning to the hive by the radio-tag reading 
equipment, Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also found that the 27-milligram tags they planned on using  
were a little too heavy for the bees; 25 mg is better. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know how to make them lighter,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico, the Oak Ridge  
National Laboratory in Tennessee and the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency also are part of the project, paid for by the 
federal Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Michael Irvin Wants Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Irvin, the Dallas Cowboys' career  
receiving leader, has requested that the team trade him, his agent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11-year veteran played a lesser role last season in Dallas'  
offense under first-year coach Chan Gailey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has not demanded a trade, but he has let the Cowboys know  
if something comes along that benefits the team and himself, he 
would be in favor of it,'' agent Steve Endicott told The Dallas 
Morning News in Monday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Endicott said Irvin had not made an ultimatum, and the wide  
receiver continues to work out regularly at the Cowboys' Irving, 
Texas practice facility, including the twice weekly coaching 
sessions that began in early May. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have already been shaken in the past month by the  
heroin death of former All Pro tackle Mark Tuinei while he was 
accompanied by current reserve fullback Ricky Sualua, and by the 
injury problems of All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning News reported that teammates and club officials are  
aware that Irvin is unhappy over his declining role in the team's 
offense, the Cowboys' refusal to extend his contract, and trade 
rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Irvin was out of town over the weekend and  
unavailable for comment, and club executive vice president Stephen 
Jones declined to speak in detail about Irvin's status. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wouldn't be fair to get in the middle of,'' said Jones,  
the son of team owner Jerry Jones. ``There are things that go on 
all the time that we don't really get into. We would have no 
comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin made 74 catches for 1,057 yards last season, his lowest of  
the last eight years, with the exception of 1996, when he missed 
the first five games because of an NFL suspension after pleading no 
contest to cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin caught only one touchdown pass, a career low. His team  
record of catching a pass in 117 straight games was snapped by 
Arizona last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailey, who became coach before the 1998 season, has emphasized  
passing the ball to many receivers, reducing Irvin's role in the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the team has extended the contracts of  
quarterback Troy Aikman and running back Emmitt Smith, but not 
Irvin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Morning News said personnel directors around the league said  
Irvin's name floated on the trade market in late April. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys have only two other experienced receivers on their  
roster, Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail, recently signed as a free agent, 
and Ernie Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas took two wide receivers in the April draft, in the fourth  
and sixth rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvin, 6-foot-2 and 207 pounds, was the 11th player chosen in  
the 1988 draft out of Miami, where he set career records for 
catches, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.

<HEADLINE>  Israelis Withdrawing from Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEZZINE, Lebanon (AP) -- Putting words into action, tanks and  
troops from the Israeli-backed Lebanese militia began withdrawing 
today from a mountain resort in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first sign of troop movement since reports of a planned  
withdrawal were confirmed Thursday, troops headed east with tanks, 
armored personnel carriers, cranes and other equipment. They 
appeared to be dismantling the base, which had served as the SLA 
headquarters for the Jezzine area. 
</P>
<P>
	The militiamen fired machine guns and tracer bullets ahead of  
them, combing the hills above the withdrawal route in standard 
evacuation procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Marjayoun, the main town in the Israeli-occupied zone  
to the south, SLA commander Antoine Lahd said he was withdrawing 
from Jezzine ``since the situation ... could no longer endure more 
slow deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the pullout from Jezzine will be over by mid-June.  
</P>
<P>
	``This stance presents an end to the (SLA's) human presence.  
What remains is the logistical one,'' said Edmond Rizk, a former 
Cabinet member and former member of Parliament in Jezzine, where 
the peacetime population of 25,000 has dwindled to under 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrilla attacks led by the Hezbollah group have hurt the SLA  
in Jezzine. A total of 155 militiamen and 65 civilians have died in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the withdrawal had officially begun, about half the  
Israeli-backed militiamen who have held this mountain town since 
1985 abandoned their garrison, dropping their guns and surrendering 
to the Lebanese government. 
</P>
<P>
	The first major retreat in 14 years could serve as a model for  
the troop withdrawals that Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak 
promised during his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Israel's departing Defense Minister Moshe Arens  
stressed Monday that the pullout from Jezzine was not part of a 
larger withdrawal from the Israeli-held zone in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, secretary-general of  
Hezbollah, promised that his Shiite Muslim guerrillas will not 
enter Jezzine when Israeli-allied militiamen withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	They will, however, continue launching attacks on Israelis and  
the South Lebanon Army militiamen from areas around Jezzine, 
Nasrallah said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.N. peacekeeping force said one of its soldiers  
was killed and another wounded Monday in cross-fire between Israeli 
forces and Muslim guerrillas in South Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Timur Goksel, spokesman for the 4,500-member United Nations  
Interim Force in Lebanon, said the casualties occurred before dawn 
near the village of Braachit, six miles north of the Israeli 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 227 peacekeepers have been killed since the U.N. force  
was deployed in southern Lebanon in 1978 under a U.N. peacekeeping 
mandate.

<HEADLINE> Dickey Relative Restoring Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINERAL BLUFF, Ga. (AP) -- A 19th century burial ground hidden in  
a thicket on a placid bluff holds ancestors of the late author 
James Dickey, best known for the novel ``Deliverance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And this gravesite is interesting in another way, too: The white  
farm couple who died more than a century ago rest alongside their 
slaves, whose graves are marked with simple fieldstones with no 
inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Dickey's cousin and an apparent descendant of the Dickey  
family's slaves are teaming up to restore the forgotten cemetery 
atop the 1,674 foot Hogback Mountain and find out more about those 
buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Dickey's great-great-great grandparents are buried in the  
plot that dates to 1842. When he first visited the site, the grass 
and weeds were up to his chin, the slave markers loose in the 
ground and the wall enclosing the plots crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	While working to restore the site, Fred Dickey, 60, is hoping to  
find out more about the people interred with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have been buried in the family plot but no one even  
took the time to scratch their name in stone,'' Dickey said during 
a visit to the site in mid-May. ``We can't give them back their 
lost lives, but we could at least do this. We owe them that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a child growing up in DeKalb, Ill., Dickey recalled hearing  
many stories about the cemetery in the north Georgia mountains. But 
it wasn't until his famous cousin, James Dickey, died in 1997 that 
he visited the gravesite. The writer won the 1966 National Book 
Award for poetry for ``Buckdancer's Choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On top of Hogback Mountain, Fred Dickey found the 40-by-50-foot  
graveyard where George Dickey, who died in 1842, and Hannah Taylor 
Dickey, who died in 1868, were buried beneath white marble 
tombstones and surrounded by the graves of some 26 slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often there were separate slave cemeteries but it just  
depended on the attitude of the master,'' said James Cobb, chair of 
the history department at the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1860 census, the widowed Hannah Dickey was listed as the  
county's second-largest slave owner with 15 slaves, said Ethelene 
Jones, a local historian. The Dickeys apparently had several small 
farms along the Toccoa River and Hothouse Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cemetery was above the settlement,'' she said. ``We've  
often wondered why the Dickeys moved so far up the mountain. The 
cemetery seems to have been so far from where their farms were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are no names on the graves nor birth or death  
records, there's nothing to suggest when or how the slaves lived or 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey, who runs a nonprofit organization in San Diego that  
makes anti-crime and anti-drug videos for inner-city youth, has 
spent $2,600 to rebuild the 3-foot concrete barrier wall, remove 
the weeds and tree stumps, and ground the slave markers in cement. 
He's also sent out dozens of letters in hopes of finding any black 
Dickeys from the area that may be descendants of the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	His search has turned up at least one -- Michael Dickey of  
Cleveland, Tenn., whose family lineage can be traced back to Fannin 
County and who remembers his mother mentioning Hannah Dickey's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me feel like I was standing on hallowed ground,''  
Michael Dickey, 50, said of his initial visit to the cemetery. 
``There's a lot of history there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dickey has joined Fred and some other white Dickeys to  
work on the restoration project, which will include a 6-by-6-foot 
granite marker at the cemetery's entrance. It will culminate with a 
rededication ceremony June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing the families together for restoring and rededicating  
the cemetery, Fred and Michael Dickey hope, will not only save the 
historic graveyard but also make a statement of racial 
reconciliation and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``White America has got some apologizing to do,'' Fred Dickey  
said. ``I think that although it's in the past, we still have to 
square the past.''

<HEADLINE> Irish Police Search for IRA Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Irish police and forensics  
specialists promised Monday to keep digging ``as long as it takes'' 
to find eight unmarked graves of Irish Republican Army victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Excavations of two sites near the Irish Republic's border with  
British-ruled Northern Ireland began Saturday, shortly after the 
outlawed IRA provided information on the likely locations to a 
British-Irish commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA apparently dug up the remains of a ninth victim and left  
them in a new casket Friday at a remote border location before 
notifying a local Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
	Police, who this week began digging at a third site south of  
Dublin and intend to start soon at two other remote spots in the 
Irish Republic, warn that results are not guaranteed anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has been found yet, and we feel it may be a long  
process because of some of the terrain we are having to deal 
with,'' police Superintendent John Farrelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that four sites identified by the IRA were bogland that  
would have to be drained, while a fifth was ``a vast wooded area.'' 
The likely deterioration of remains of people, all abducted and 
killed from 1972 to 1981, made the effort even less certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will go on as long as it takes,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The site receiving most public attention is an isolated beach  
midway between Belfast and Dublin, where the IRA says it buried 
37-year-old Jean McConville back in 1972. The IRA branded the 
Belfast homemaker a spy, while her relatives say she was punished 
for giving first aid to a British soldier shot outside her home. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman's 10 children -- who were consigned to separate foster  
homes and barely know each other today -- had an emotional reunion 
Sunday at the site, where jackhammers and a backhoe were used to 
break through a parking lot built on part of the beach about 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday, Mrs. McConville's son-in-law Seamus McKendry -- who  
leads Families of the Disappeared, the pressure group that spurred 
the IRA move -- said he was increasingly worried that the search 
might prove futile. Engineers had already dug up most of the 
parking lot and gone down up to 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we know this much, that this was her final resting  
place,'' McKendry said in a telephone interview, noise from 
machinery and crashing waves in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party and a

<HEADLINE> Stars Try To Avoid Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Baseball supposedly has the juiced ball. Maybe  
hockey has the juiced puck. 
</P>
<P>
	There has to be some way to explain how the Dallas Stars and  
Colorado Avalanche have turned the Western Conference finals into a 
high-stakes version of the offensive-oriented NHL All-Star Game. 
</P>
<P>
	After combining for 12 goals in Game 5 on Sunday, the teams  
return to the ice Tuesday night with Colorado one victory from 
advancing to its second Stanley Cup finals in four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this round has gone so far, you can expect anything,''  
Colorado coach Bob Hartley said Monday. ``I didn't look into my 
magic ball today. The person who can predict what type of game it 
will be is a very bright man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To stave off elimination, the Stars need to avoid another  
fast-paced shootout that favored the fleet-skating Avalanche. 
Colorado scored seven goals in the first four games of the series 
before winning 7-5 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started playing their game,'' Dallas captain Derian Hatcher  
said. ``We didn't hit people the way we need to. We didn't check 
the way we need to. We played their game. We can't win games like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's scoring binge came without rookie forward Milan  
Hejduk (broken collarbone) and all-star right wing Theo Fleury, who 
missed Game 5 because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury did not skate Monday but Hartley said he is feeling  
better and hopes to return for Game 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made sure I was walking on the other side of the street,''  
Colorado goaltender Patrick Roy said of staying away from his 
contagious teammate. ``It was nice to see Theo was much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury and Hejduk out, the Avalanche figured to be in  
trouble heading into Dallas for Game 5, but Peter Forsberg, Valeri 
Kamensky and rookie Chris Drury made up for their absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his only goal went into an empty net Sunday, Forsberg  
was the strongest offensive player on the ice. He set up two goals 
and rarely was knocked off the puck when the Avalanche controlled 
the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The switch in Peter's mind went on and forced him to raise his  
game,'' Hartley said. ``He seems to get better and better with each 
game and he wants to compete. You see sparks in his eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drury has provided another kind of spark, scoring the  
game-winning goal in Game 4 before adding two more Sunday. He is in 
quest of his third team championship; Drury won the Little League 
World Series in 1989 and the NCAA hockey title with Boston 
University in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has great hockey sense,'' Hartley said. ``Once in a while  
it might happen by luck, but by the way he is accumulating 
game-winning goals, you don't just do that by luck. You have to 
have a natural instinct, and Chris Drury has that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Colorado's two-game surge, it's too early to discount  
Dallas. The Stars had the league's top record and did not lose 
three straight all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to us to turn the tables on them and steal one in  
their building,'' forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We had to go to 
Denver anyhow, so we might as well go up there and win it.''

<HEADLINE> Women in Developed World, Fewer Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Women in the developed world have fewer children than women in  
the developing world for several reasons, population experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Women in the developed world are more likely to work outside the  
home. Contrary to agricultural societies, where more children mean 
more working hands, modern urban life imposes costs on families to 
feed, house and educate children. Contraception also is more 
available in the world's richer countries. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the average growth rate in the poorest countries is  
eight times higher than in wealthy countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Women in developing countries have an average of 5.5 children.  
Babies in the poorest countries are 11 times more likely to die in 
infancy; their life expectancy is 50 years -- 24 years fewer than in 
the rich countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization estimates about 585,000 woman die  
in childbirth annually. The WHO also estimates about 78,000 deaths 
a year are due to unsafe abortions.

<HEADLINE> Indy Winner Talks Soft, Drives Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- For Kenny Brack, winning the Indianapolis  
500 was a goal, not his life's ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really got to get myself some new goals now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Those would include winning another IRL title and, who knows,  
maybe another Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack won his first Indy on Sunday, then mostly watched as car  
owner A.J. Foyt took center stage during the celebration. That was 
just fine with Brack. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we rode around the track on the victory lap, I don't  
think I heard my name screamed once,'' he said Monday, smiling at 
his owner. Foyt was the first to drive to four Indy victories and 
now, thanks to his mostly unheralded driver, owns a fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack looked tired and talked softly, appearing a bit  
uncomfortable after a night of interviews and celebration and a 
morning photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been chaotic,'' he said. ``It's been a lot of fun, but I  
can't take too many days of this. Besides, I've got a race in a 
week and I've got to start focusing on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's typical of Brack, a 33-year-old driver who displays  
little of the cockiness of most racing stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight, blond Swede leaves the brash talk to Foyt, a  
64-year-old Texan with a down-home twang and a penchant for 
outrageous remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the winner of what many still perceive as the world's  
most prestigious race, Brack could become a household name. 
</P>
<P>
	He even got a phone call from the King of Sweden following his  
big win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice of him to call and it's nice to get all the  
attention,'' he said. ``But I don't care about that,'' he said. ``I 
race because I want to win races. That's why I'm in this business. 
If winning this race makes me a household name in America and other 
parts of the world, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Brack he won three races on the way to his  
championship. Still, he remained a virtual unknown to most of this 
country -- until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in Sweden, Brack's career goal was to reach Formula  
One. 
</P>
<P>
	His apprenticeship was spent in road racing and his future  
seemed assured in the mid-90s when he was hired as a Formula One 
test driver, first by Williams and then Arrows. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he suddenly popped up in this country, driving Indy cars  
for Rick Galles, first in CART and then in the rival IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	His first Indy 500 was in 1997, sort of. He was caught up in a  
crash on the warmup lap, finishing 33rd without ever taking the 
green flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least that gave me some experience,'' Brack said with a  
shrug. ``Last year, when I drove for A.J. was really the first time 
I ran in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that one, he finished sixth and might have had a shot at  
winning had not the team miscalculated fuel mileage early in the 
race, running him dry and costing him a lap he never made up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Brack won after leader Robby Gordon ran out of fuel  
with just more than one lap from the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt has been around racing long enough to know that luck comes  
and goes without warning. But he also knows it's essential to have 
a good driver who can take advantage of the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody laughed at me when I hired him,'' Foyt said. ``I  
knew he could drive a race car. Now everybody knows it.''

<HEADLINE> Mechanic Survives Indy Pit Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Crewmates of a mechanic who was critically  
injured when he was run over on pit row during the Indy 500 said 
Monday they are staying optimistic he will be OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, management of the Energizer Motorsports team will  
have their crews donning helmets at the next Indy Racing League 
event June 12 at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief mechanic Steve Fried remained in critical but stable  
condition in the intensive care unit at Methodist Hospital in 
Indianapolis on Monday. He is awake and responding to those around 
him, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Energizer team spokesman Greg Hoover said doctors have told  
Fried's colleagues not to expect a change in his condition for at 
least two to three more days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just really a wait and see situation,'' Hoover said. ``I  
guess right now we are guardedly optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bizarre events left the team emotionally spent by Monday  
morning, Hoover said. The driver for the three-month-old racing 
team -- IRL rookie Robby McGehee -- finished fifth in the league's 
most prestigious race. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried was directing his driver's car out of the pit on the 12th  
lap when Jimmy Kite's car hit him from behind. Kite's car was hit 
from behind by Johnny Unser, whose brakes failed as he entered the 
pit. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried flipped and landed on his face. He was admitted to  
Methodist Hospital with head and chest injuries. The collision 
disabled Kite's steering, preventing him from avoiding Fried. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL has no rule requiring pit crews to wear helmets, but  
team manager Dave Conti said the Energizer crews will wear helmets 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
	Six CART teams are wearing a prototype helmet designed by Bell  
Auto Racing. Bell officials said Sunday they hoped to speed 
development of the helmets, which they will give to any interested 
racing teams for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hindsight being 20-20, we are going to outfit all the crew  
with helmets, even the tire changers,'' Conti said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Hoover said the team is focused on its chief mechanic  
and his family -- not helmets or the race in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't even thinking about that race right now,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Wins Closest Bolder Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Berhanu Adanne of Ethiopia outmaneuvered  
Armando Quintanilla and Hezron Otwori in the final quarter-mile 
Monday to win the closest race in Bolder Boulder history. 
</P>
<P>
	Lidia Simon, a marathon runner from Romania, captured the  
women's individual title, but Ethiopia won the $12,000 team 
championship, edging second-place Kenya by four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Quintanilla, the 1994 champion, Mexico won the men's team  
title -- finishing second, fourth and sixth. Adanne's Ethiopian team 
was eight points behind, and Columbia came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the best races in the event's 21-year history,  
Quintanilla, Adanne and Otwori each led in the final half-mile 
before Adanne started to pull away with 400 meters remaining. He 
made his move on a hill leading into Folsom Field and finished in 
29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintanilla, who dictated the pace for much of the 10-kilometer  
race, tried to catch Adanne in the final 200 meters, but he 
finished two seconds behind. Otwori, second last year, was three 
seconds back of Adanne, and seven seconds separated the top five 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, an Olympian in 1996, trailed only briefly in the women's  
race and opened a four-second lead over Ethiopia's Asha Gigi just 
after the five-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was never challenged down the stretch and blew kisses to  
the stadium crowd as she crossed the finish line in 32:30. Gigi was 
17 seconds back and Jane Ngotho of Kenya was third in 32:52. 
</P>
<P>
	Gigi led the Ethiopians with her second-place finish, while  
teammates Werknesh Kidane and Eyerusalem Kuma finished fifth and 
11th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending women's champion Jane Omoro of Kenya, whose winning  
time was 33:26 last year, was sixth in 33:06. Deena Drossin was the 
top U.S. woman, finishing fourth in 32:56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese women won the team title last year, but did not  
compete because of NATO's accidental bombing of their embassy in 
Yugoslavia. The bombing prompted the closure of the American 
consulate in China, and the Chinese racers were unable to obtain 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing was defending men's champion Simon Rono of Kenya,  
who skipped the race because of the death of his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Albina Gallyamova, 35, of St. Petersburg, Russia, won the  
women's citizen's race in 34:56. It was her first time competing in 
the Bolder Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Wilson, 30, of Bruce, Australia, was the top finisher in  
the men's citizen field, finishing in 30:42. Wilson was one of four 
Australian professional runners to travel to Boulder, but each 
country can have only three racers in the elite race.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Repair Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Working fast, astronauts fixed a  
broken radio, replaced flawed battery packs and installed foam 
mufflers over noisy fans Monday aboard the new international space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	They launched into the repairs within minutes of entering the  
77-foot orbiting complex late Sunday. Several hours later, much of 
the work was done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It literally was open the hatch and run in there and get to  
work,'' flight director Paul Hill said, marveling at the crew's 
speed and precision. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of space shuttle Discovery's seven astronauts immediately  
went to work on the radio system inside the American-made Unity 
module, replacing two electronic boxes. The new parts allowed NASA 
to once again monitor all systems aboard Unity. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio link from Unity was lost in April, just four months  
after the module was hoisted into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congratulations, you have a lot of happy flight controllers  
looking at data,'' Mission Control called up. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Russian Valery Tokarev and Canadian Julie  
Payette pulled up the floor inside the Russian-built Zarya control 
module to reach batteries that had not been charging right for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the six batteries has three electronic meters, and each  
meter needed to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday morning, Tokarev and Payette had finished work on four  
batteries, taking only half as much time as expected. They wrapped 
up the job Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew also tackled Zarya's noise problem.  
</P>
<P>
	When Zarya, the first space station component, was launched by  
the Russians in November, it did not meet NASA's acoustic standards 
because of clattering fans. Officials compared the noise level to a 
busy street corner. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern is not for visiting shuttle crews like this one,  
which took along ear plugs just in case, but rather for the 
astronauts and cosmonauts who will spend months on board the 
station beginning next year. Unless the noise is reduced 
significantly, or unless they wear ear plugs, their hearing could 
be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, Tokarev and Dr. Daniel Barry finished covering the  
air-circulating fans, ducts and vents with sturdy foam pads, even 
though they could not find the right fasteners and had to 
improvise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a little bit noisy in there. I think the mufflers helped  
a bit,'' Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the racket and chill -- it was a brisk 57 degrees when  
they floated inside -- the astronauts seemed to enjoy their new, 
spacious quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful spacecraft,'' said shuttle commander Kent  
Rominger, ``and it's very roomy compared to what we're used on the 
space shuttle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts have until Thursday to finish the repairs and  
unload 1 1/2 tons of tools, spare parts, computers, water and clothes 
into the station's two compartments. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatches will be sealed early Thursday, and Discovery will  
pull away Thursday night. The shuttle is due back on Earth on 
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Treatment May Stop HIV From Hiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A special therapy might flush the AIDS virus out  
of a safe haven in the body, scientists say, but they stress that 
it's too soon to tell. 
</P>
<P>
	Their work is presented in the June issue of the journal Nature  
Medicine. The Associated Press reported the results last November, 
when they were presented at a scientific meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment for HIV infection can drive the virus down to  
undetectable levels in the blood. But HIV can still hide in some 
inactive blood cells called T cells. The new work was aimed at 
activating these cells so HIV would emerge, the cells would die, 
and the new HIV would be stymied by standard drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the National Institutes of Health reported on  
14 patients getting standard HIV treatment plus the cell-stimulator 
interleukin-2. No HIV could be recovered from T cells in three of 
these patients, or in lymph node tissue from two of these three. 
</P>
<P>
	Reseachers cautioned that HIV might still be hiding elsewhere in  
the body. They also said it will take a different kind of study, in 
which patients are randomly assigned to get interleukin-2 treatment 
or not, to test the effect of the treatment.

<HEADLINE>  Ocalan Offers Rebel Cease-Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Begging and bargaining for his  
life, Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan declared at the opening 
of his treason trial Monday that Turkey would have peace if it 
spared him the gallows -- and warned that ``hundreds of thousands 
will die'' if it did not. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking through a microphone in a bulletproof and bombproof  
cage in a converted movie theater, Ocalan directed his fighters to 
give up their armed struggle. He offered to arrange their outright 
surrender if he was allowed to contact them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The armed clashes should immediately cease and arms should  
immediately be laid down,'' Ocalan declared. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his first direct call to abandon the 15-year-old  
guerrilla campaign for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The 
war has claimed 37,000 victims, mostly Kurds. Ocalan called for a 
cease-fire in the struggle in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``For peace and brotherhood I am ready to serve the Turkish  
state, and I believe that for this end I must remain alive,'' 
Ocalan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What will happen if I die?'' the rebel chief asked. ``The  
organization will send out thousands of fighters, and hundreds of 
thousands of people will die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is widely expected to be convicted and sentenced to hang.  
An overwhelming majority of Turks hold him responsible for all the 
deaths in the conflict, and there is strong support for his 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was Ocalan's first public appearance since he was brought  
to Imrali following his February capture by Turkish commandos in 
Kenya. The stocky guerrilla leader seemed thinner, but healthy. He 
appeared calm but spoke hesitantly, gesturing frequently with his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the court he had not been tortured or mistreated.  
</P>
<P>
	The guerrilla leader, who tolerated no dissent within his rebel  
organization, appeared conciliatory Monday, asking the families of 
the 5,000 Turkish soldiers slain in the war to forgive him for 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``I share the sorrow of the martyrs' relatives deep in my  
heart,'' Ocalan said, facing the families. ``I apologize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shameful!'' an angry mother shouted back.  
</P>
<P>
	Many of the families were draped in Turkish flags and carried  
pictures of their slain sons. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if Ocalan issued his appeal and threat solely  
as a tactic to avoid the death penalty or if it was another step in 
his effort to transform his faltering military struggle and 
international isolation into a political battle within Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey regards any hint of Kurdish nationalism as a threat to  
the state's existence. It has ignored several cease-fires called by 
Ocalan's PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, and has brushed aside his 
calls to negotiate a political solution to the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey maintains 250,000 soldiers and police in the largely  
Kurdish southeast, fighting 4,500 rebels. Human rights groups say 
the military has destroyed thousands of Kurdish villages in a 
scorched-earth campaign, pushing the rebels deep into the mountains 
and northern Iraq 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey closely monitors Kurdish political and cultural  
organizations and has closed several due to suspected contacts with 
the PKK. It is illegal to broadcast or teach in Kurdish. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan said he wanted his PKK to ``give up its stance against  
the state and prepare for a legalization process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting has persisted in the southeast. Authorities said Monday  
that a new clash killed 10 rebels and one Turkish security officer. 
They did not say when that occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan is facing trial before a State Security Court.  
International human rights groups have sharply criticized the 
tribunals, saying they are biased because they include a military 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has proposed reforming the courts to remove the  
military judge, but the judges on Monday turned down an appeal by 
Ocalan's lawyers to postpone his trial to give the government time 
to pass a court reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the lawyers walked out in protest. The military judge  
could still withdraw from the case. The judge's likely replacement, 
a civilian, is already on the prison island. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurds in Europe marked the opening of the trial with demands for  
Ocalan's freedom, demonstrating in Germany, the Netherlands, Russia 
and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	In Denmark, 2,000 people gathered chanting, ``Long live  
Ocalan!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Ocalan's capture, Kurds led protests throughout  
Europe, storming embassies and setting themselves on fire. In 
Turkey, PKK rebels attacked repeatedly, killing more than a dozen 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities imposed strict security measures for the trial.  
Warships patrolled the coast near the island and helicopters 
hovered above Mudanya, the nearest port. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists attending the trial were fingerprinted and had their  
retinas scanned for identification. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish commandos wearing black ski masks guarded the coast of  
the island, where Ocalan is the only prisoner.

<HEADLINE> Ballpark Dining Goes Upscale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hot dogs and popcorn just won't cut the mustard  
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	With baseball salaries soaring and teams looking to pack  
skyboxes with upscale fans, the ballpark menu is getting a new 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Larry Levy, a Chicago entrepreneur. Instead of ``Buy me  
some peanuts and Cracker Jack,'' he has fans humming a different 
tune. More like, ``Serve me some sushi and Chardonnay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levy's company, Levy Restaurants Sports &AMP; Entertainment Group,  
provides food service to skyboxes and clubs for 26 major pro teams. 
And fans are eating it up -- generating revenues of $200 million for 
the company in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into this because I love baseball,'' Levy said while  
overseeing his enterprise at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago 
Cubs. ``But I'm so busy at the ballpark that I have no time to 
watch the game and have to wait until I get home and find out the 
score on ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wrigley skyboxes, Levy provides ballpark staples such as  
wieners, but also such culinary treats as smokehouse barbecue pork. 
The Stadium Club provides more gourmet cuisine, like salmon 
souffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy also plays on regional favorites, offering sushi in  
California stadiums and Southern cooking at Nashville Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Even restaurant critics are starting to take notice of Levy's  
company, which got its start 20 years ago with a deli. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very good for what it is -- ballpark food. People don't  
expect gourmet food there,'' says Don Rose, a Chicago restaurant 
critic who has tasted Levy's skybox cuisine. ``The Levys have been 
able to take their know-how in the restaurant business and applied 
that at the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brothers Larry and Mark Levy -- who now own 21 restaurants  
nationwide -- started out with a delicatessen in 1978. They didn't 
do well at first and their mother, Eadie, had to rescue them with 
recipes from her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her reward? Her own place. She still greets customers at Mrs.  
Levy's Delicatessen in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Levys got into the stadium food business when Chicago White  
Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf needed someone to cater his new skyboxes 
at Comiskey Park in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``He promised us some playoff tickets if we did him the favor,''  
Larry Levy remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy expanded to crosstown Wrigley Field, then to Cleveland's  
Jacobs Field. Now, Levy-fed stadiums are spread from the MCI Center 
outside Washington and Pro Player Stadium in Miami to Portland's 
Rose Garden and the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Levy has about one-fourth of the major pro sports market.  
He also caters rock concerts and even provided food for Pope John 
Paul II's visit to St. Louis in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned from our experience in the restaurant business,  
you never say 'no' to a customer,'' Levy says. ``We try to fill all 
kinds of special diet requests -- vegetarian, skinless chicken -- you 
name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Guidici, a 36-year-old trader at the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, says the clients he brings to his skybox at Wrigley are 
thrilled with the food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food always gets compliments; there's never any  
complaints,'' Guidici says. ``They go out of their way to make sure 
everything is perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even after a Cubs game was called off one recent rainy  
afternoon, some skybox fans stayed to party for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a complete wipeout for us. We made some money on  
early food sales,'' said Brett Bils, Levy's manager at Wrigley. 
``The leftover food goes to a shelter for battered women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, the dessert cart rolls by.  
</P>
<P>
	``Snickers pie, cheesecakes, giant taffy apples, gourmet ice  
cream bars, white chocolate pecan turtles, All-American apple pie. 
I promise, everything is fat-free,'' says Toni Parker, operator of 
the Levy dessert wagon, aptly decorated with replicas of Wrigley's 
signature ivy and brick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the desserts are what they remember when they leave  
the ballpark,'' Bils says. ``We hope they remember the good food 
and good time they had here and want to come back for more someday 
soon.''

<HEADLINE> Little-Remembered Man Donates $377K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHILTON, Wis. (AP) -- An 80-year-old man who died last winter  
bequeathed $377,000 to a church he never joined, fairgrounds he 
rarely visited and a hospital where no one remembered him. 
</P>
<P>
	Randolph Landgraf, a World War II veteran, died in November  
after spending two years in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a very private person and never told us of his plans,''  
said niece Barbara Schmidlkofer of Bonita Springs, Fla., his 
closest surviving relative. ``I guess he wanted to do something for 
the city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calumet Medical Center received $94,000, though there's no  
record Landgraf was ever a patient there, said Lea Whitby, hospital 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Martin's Lutheran Church also got $94,000, though he wasn't  
a member. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best we can tell is that he worshipped at our church as a  
young man,'' said the Rev. Wayne Huebner, the pastor. ``Sometimes 
people in small towns do wonderful things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining $189,000 went to the Calumet County Fair Board. No  
one on the board knew the gift was coming, or even knew who 
Landgraf was. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquaintances said Landgraf rarely attended the fair.  
</P>
<P>
	Landgraf's family was once prominent in the town of 4,000, a  
half-hour drive south of Green Bay. His three older brothers died 
before him.

<HEADLINE> Markets Closed for Holiday / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stock markets are closed Monday for the  
Memorial Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks finished a turbulent week with solid gains Friday as new  
data showing slower-than-expected economic growth helped calm fears 
about rising inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also jumped at the chance to pick up shares at cheaper  
prices as a result of Wall Street's slump this week. 
</P>
<P>
	After tumbling 235 points Thursday, its worst drop in eight  
months, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.81 points Friday, 
or by 0.9 percent, to close at 10,559.74. The blue-chip index was 
up as much as 122 points in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indexes were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose  
20.43 to 1,301.84, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index 
rose 51.37 to 2,470.52. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow seesawed all week with declines of more than 1 percent  
on both Monday and Tuesday, then a rebound of more than 1 percent 
on Wednesday before tumbling 2.2 percent Thursday. With Friday's 
gains, the average ended down 269.54 points, or by 2.5 percent, for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow also finished down 2.1 percent for the month of May, its  
steepest monthly decline of the year. But it is up 15 percent for 
the first five months of 1999, a much stronger performance than 
many expected when the year began. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light Friday as market professionals eased into the  
three-day holiday weekend. U.S. financial markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The low volume and broad-based gains provided an antidote to the  
week's volatile ride on Wall Street. The market swung amid 
persistent fears that any signs of rising inflation will prompt the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Higher rates typically cut 
into profits as it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still are in a tug-of-war between those people who think  
interest rates will go higher and those that don't,'' said Alan 
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the fears about rising inflation and interest rates  
were tempered after the Purchasing Management Association of 
Chicago on Friday reported a greater-than-expected drop in its 
business activity index. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped boost stocks, especially banks and financial  
services shares, which have been hurt by concerns over an 
interest-rate hike. Citigroup rose 2 13/16 to 66 1/4 and American 
Express gained 4 3/16 to 121 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of bargain-hunters entering the market Friday also  
helped lift stocks. Investors were looking to pick up stocks at 
much cheaper prices than they were just a week ago. Microsoft 
gained 2 5/16 to close at 80 11/16 and Amazon.com rose 4 3/16 to 
118 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tech stocks and Internet stocks look like they've reached  
some sort of bottom,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at 
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``That sector has gotten so beaten up, 
it's encouraging to see them looking like they're coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech stocks have been especially weak throughout the  
interest-rate watch. Because many of them trade at prices far above 
their earnings, they become less appealing to investors when 
corporate profits are threatened by higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Government data due out next Tuesday should provide a stronger  
indication of the economy's health. The National Association of 
Purchasing Management will release its monthly survey on 
manufacturing activity nationwide, and the Conference Board will 
report on leading economic Indicators for April. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 782.8 
million shares, compared with 978.9 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.24 to 622.26, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.35 to 778.74. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies gained 5.76 to 438.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.26 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed up 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Stage Caves at Mass. Bikini Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LENA, Miss. (AP) -- A stage collapsed during a festival bikini  
contest at a drag race, injuring at least seven people. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said a man in the crowd tried to climb onto the stage  
to get to the contestants Sunday just before the front half of the 
stage caved in, sending bikini-clad women and other performers 
crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The contest was part of the Pre-Memorial Day Street and Strip  
Grudge Match Shootout at Lake Slipaway Drag Strip in Leake County. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Cleveland, a sports reporter for The Clarion Ledger of  
Jackson, who was there, said 31 women were competing in the beauty 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had announced at least five or six times that there were  
too many people on the stage and people were going to have to get 
down,'' said Cleveland. Cleveland said when the unidentified man in 
the crowd climbed on the stage, two security guards moved toward 
him and the stage collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone Ambulance Service transported at least seven people,  
including members of a band that had been performing, who had leg, 
back and other injuries, Teresa Malone said. Four were treated at a 
local hospital and three others, including one contestant, were 
taken to Jackson hospitals, she said. The injuries were not 
life-threatening.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Threat Cancels Rogers Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A bomb threat forced the evacuation of more  
than 3,000 people at a Kenny Rogers concert at Royal Albert Hall in 
London, his publicist said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	No bomb was found and no injuries were reported Sunday night,  
publicist Cheryl Kagan said. The concert was supposed to be the 
last for the country singer during a 10-nation tour, but it will be 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm extremely disappointed,'' said Rogers, who was about to  
take the stage when police recommended the evacuation. ``I don't 
understand who benefits from this. It's an unpolitical gathering of 
people who are out for a night of good fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Albert Hall confirmed the concert was canceled because of  
a security alert. They wouldn't say whether anyone claimed 
responsibility for the threat.

<HEADLINE> Dickey Relative Restoring Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINERAL BLUFF, Ga. (AP) -- The old cemetery atop Hogback Mountain  
contains the graves of two ancestors of the late author James 
Dickey, best known for the novel ``Deliverance.'' It also holds the 
graves of their slaves -- all marked by simple stones with no 
inscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Dickey's cousin and an apparent descendant of the Dickey  
family's slaves are teaming up to restore the forgotten cemetery 
and find out more about those buried there. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Dickey's great-great-great grandparents are buried in the  
plot that dates to 1842. When he first visited the site, the grass 
and weeds were up to his chin, the slave markers loose in the 
ground and the wall enclosing the plots crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey is hoping to find out more about the people interred with  
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may have been buried in the family plot but no one even  
took the time to scratch their name in stone,'' Dickey said during 
a visit to the site in mid-May. ``We can't give them back their 
lost lives, but we could at least do this. We owe them that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a child growing up in DeKalb, Ill., Dickey recalled hearing  
many stories about the cemetery in the north Georgia mountains. But 
it wasn't until his famous cousin, James Dickey, died in 1997 that 
he visited the gravesite. The writer won the 1966 National Book 
Award for poetry for ``Buckdancer's Choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On top of Hogback Mountain, Fred Dickey found the 40-by-50-foot  
graveyard where George Dickey, who died in 1842, and Hannah Taylor 
Dickey, who died in 1868, were buried beneath white marble 
tombstones and surrounded by the graves of some 26 slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often there were separate slave cemeteries but it just  
depended on the attitude of the master,'' said James Cobb, chair of 
the history department at the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1860 census, the widowed Hannah Dickey was listed as the  
county's second-largest slave owner with 15 slaves, said Ethelene 
Jones, a local historian. The Dickeys, who were white, apparently 
had several small farms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cemetery was above the settlement,'' she said. ``We've  
often wondered why the Dickeys moved so far up the mountain. The 
cemetery seems to have been so far from where their farms were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because there are no names on the graves nor birth or death  
records, there's nothing to suggest when or how the slaves lived or 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey, who runs a nonprofit organization in San Diego that  
makes anti-crime and anti-drug videos for inner-city youth, has 
spent $2,600 to rebuild the 3-foot concrete barrier wall, remove 
the weeds and tree stumps and ground the slave markers in cement. 
He's also sent out dozens of letters in hopes of finding any black 
Dickeys from the area that may be descendants of the slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	His search has turned up at least one -- Michael Dickey of  
Cleveland, Tenn., whose family lineage can be traced back to Fannin 
County and who remembers his mother mentioning Hannah Dickey's 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made me feel like I was standing on hallowed ground,''  
Michael Dickey, 50, said of his initial visit to the cemetery. 
``There's a lot of history there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dickey has joined Fred and some other white Dickeys to  
work on the restoration project, which will include a 6-by-6-foot 
granite marker at the cemetery's entrance. A rededication ceremony 
is planned for June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing the families together for restoring and rededicating  
the cemetery, Fred and Michael Dickey hope, will not only save the 
historic graveyard but also make a statement of racial 
reconciliation and respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``White America has got some apologizing to do,'' Fred Dickey  
said. ``I think that although it's in the past, we still have to 
square the past.''

<HEADLINE> Six Die in Crash on Penn. Turnpike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, Pa. (AP) -- Five young Amish people and their hired  
driver were killed early today when their van crossed a center 
divider on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and plowed into a 
tractor-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
	A seventh person in the van was in critical condition, and the  
truck driver was hospitalized with ``moderate injuries,'' state 
police Cpl. John Cypress said. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was traveling westbound on the turnpike 84 miles  
southeast of Pittsburgh. The driver lost control, hit the divider, 
and then crossed an emergency opening into the eastbound lane, 
Cypress said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were thrown from the van as it collided with the  
truck and burst into flames, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were two pairs of sisters whose ages ranged from 16 to  
20, an Amish man who has not been identified, and the group's 
40-year-old driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish usually hire drivers for long trips because their  
religious beliefs discourage driving automobiles.

<HEADLINE> CD-ROM Teaches Kids Anatomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Whether it's a fresh-from-the-factory model or a 50-something  
model with more than a few dents, the human body is an amazing 
machine, and understanding it is an important part of 
elementary-level education. 
</P>
<P>
	DK Interactive Learning has a CD-ROM aimed at 6- to 10-year-olds  
that's worth a look. My Amazing Human Body runs on both IBM and Mac 
platforms and presents human anatomy in an entertaining and 
instructive way. 
</P>
<P>
	The star of My Amazing Human Body is Seemore Skinless, a chatty  
skeleton with multicolored internal organs, and the CD-ROM offers 
six main areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take Me Apart'' allows the child to explode and reassemble  
Seemore's body using drag-and-drop with the mouse. It helps build 
an overview of what's where, and won't let the user put a kidney 
where an eyeball is required. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Am I Made Of?'' allows children to zero in on specific  
body parts, delivering anatomical factoids and offering rotated and 
x-ray views, as well as a ``poke'' function and measurements. DK 
Interactive Learning handles the differences between male and 
female by ignoring them -- Seemore has no genitalia or sexual 
characteristics of any sort. 
</P>
<P>
	``Build Me A Body'' is a game in which answering questions earns  
you body parts. When the body is complete, the child can name it 
and ``photograph'' it. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sun's Weather May Add to Y2K Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- As if potential Year 2000 computer problems are  
not enough, stormy weather predicted for the sun early next year 
also could torment Earth's modern technology. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean celebrating the new millennium in the dark, with  
a dead cellular phone. Ships and planes relying on satellites for 
navigation might have trouble. Even spacewalking astronauts are at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers, using new techniques, are forecasting the sun is  
going to enter the most violent and disruptive part of its 11-year 
cycle. The worst is expected to begin in January, when computers 
around the world struggle to cope with possible problems caused by 
the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Severe solar storms erupting with massive bursts of magnetic  
energy and radiation are expected to continue at their peak until 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Solar flares and coronal mass ejections -- solar explosions that  
can equal a million 100 megaton bombs -- send waves of energy toward 
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	They can cause power blackouts, block some radio communications  
and trigger phantom commands capable of sending satellites spinning 
out of their proper orbits. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular telephones, global positioning signals and spacewalking  
astronauts all are at risk, experts said Monday at a national 
meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	There were two pieces of good news: The solar cycle is not  
expected to be as severe as some in the past, and, for the first 
time, there may be some warning, thanks to a government satellite 
that will detect bursts of solar solar energy and send about an 
hour's notice, said JoAnn Joselyn of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning, posted on the Internet and relayed through a  
special system, will give power companies time to align circuits to 
minimize or avoid damage from electrical surges, she said. 
Satellite operators can power down equipment or prepare to send 
corrective signals to their spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have plotted 23 solar cycles, using historic and  
modern measurements. But the current cycle may be the most 
disruptive ever because much of the vulnerable communications 
technology now in use is new and has not been exposed to maximum 
solar activity, Joselyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explosion in technology is intersecting with an extremely  
disturbed space environment,'' Joselyn said. ``There is much higher 
risk now because we depend more on technology that is vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joselyn said energy bursts from the sun can cause an electrical  
charge to build up on the surface of satellites, triggering phantom 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier solar cycle, she said, small rocket thrusters on a  
satellites suddenly started firing, sending the spacecraft out of 
position. Control of another satellite was lost when its gyroscopes 
were disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Joselyn said cellular telephone are vulnerable because they may  
use the ionosphere -- the region of electrically charged gases in 
the upper atmosphere -- to send radio signals, and bursts from the 
sun can disturb the ionosphere. Some cellular phone systems depend 
on satellites that are at risk, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Solar energy eruptions can cause warm air to surge up from the  
Earth. That can drag some satellites to lower orbits, forcing 
satellite operators to use rocket fuel to reposition the 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide navigation, for ships and airplanes, relies heavily on  
the Global Position Satellite system, which uses a fleet of 
satellites that can be affected by the sun, said Joselyn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about the GPS more than anything else,'' she  
said. ``We're starting to land airplanes with that system now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electromagnetic energy from the sun can send huge waves of  
electrical energy surging along power lines, shorting circuits and 
burning out equipment. A 1989 solar storm caused a province-wide 
blackout in Quebec, and coils in a transformer station in Salem, 
N.J., melted and caught fire, causing a regional outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts generally are safe inside the shuttle or the  
International Space Station, but future missions to the moon or 
Mars will have to guard to solar radiation bursts. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the moon, they could get enough radiation to be lethal,''  
said Joselyn. ``If we fly to Mars, we'll have to consider the 
hazardous radiation from the sun.''

<HEADLINE> Drug's Advocate Fights Regulators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Flying low over South Korea aboard Army  
medical helicopters, Stephen Mumford saw a flesh-and-blood bar 
graph of the impact rapid population growth can have on a poor 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumford, then administrator at an evacuation hospital, remembers  
skimming the country's roads in the late 1960s. Day after day, he 
saw people below streaming toward the capital city of Seoul. 
Thousands unable to feed themselves by farming migrated to the city 
for factory jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see this migration below: household belongings in  
oxen carts and old pickup trucks,'' Mumford recalls. ``That's when 
I recognized that overpopulation was truly a serious problem that 
threatened the security of all countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the United States and earned a doctorate in  
public health, then began a career promoting contraception and 
population control. For two decades, his fervor has focused on a 
female sterilization method using quinacrine hydrochloride, a 
chemical the Food and Drug Administration and the World Health 
Organization say has not been adequately tested. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been enmeshed in it for 20-odd years. He breathes it.  
He's the only one currently who will not give up on it,'' said Dr. 
Michael Benjamin, a Tamarac, Fla., gynecologist who wants to use 
quinacrine in his practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents caution the drug needs more testing to resolve safety  
concerns. Some say Mumford and his associates have rashly promoted 
a drug used to sterilize more than 100,000 women in developing 
countries when there are questions about whether it causes cancer, 
prompts cells to mutate or affects undetected fetuses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not at this point per se opposed to it. I am opposed to  
its use in people at this time based on the complete lack of 
adequate testing,'' said Dr. Amy Pollack, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist and president of AVSC International, 
which promotes family planning and reproductive health in the 
developing world. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA warned Mumford and his colleague, Dr. Elton Kessel, a  
Carlton, Ore., physician that they were violating U.S. law by 
shipping pellets abroad from a storehouse in Mumford's Chapel Hill 
home. They were told to destroy their stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss company that made pellets on contract for Mumford's  
Center for Research on Population and Security has discontinued 
doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumford said he would welcome funds -- it would cost $8 million --  
to could test quinacrine to ensure that it meets FDA guidelines, 
but says quinacrine has been used in humans for six decades. For 
him, the choice is acting to limit populations -- or doom. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's population is expected to reach six billion people  
this year. In 2015, the UN estimates there will be 7.3 billion 
people -- about six billion of them in the developing world. Global 
population is expected to be about 9.4 billion in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing sterilization services to everyone in the world  
would be peanuts compared to what the population wars will cost 
us,'' said Mumford, 56, who volunteers that he had a vasectomy in 
his 30s after he and his wife had two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumford's latest quest is to convince American doctors and  
researchers the drug is safe. He and Kessel touted quinacrine 
during a recent National Family Planning and Reproductive Health 
Association meeting in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Family Health International, a Research Triangle  
Park firm founded to find contraception methods for Third World 
cultures, helped develop quinacrine sterilizations in the 1970s and 
1980s. The firm says quinacrine holds great promise but shouldn't 
be used until there's more testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumford and Kessel, both former employees of FHI, joined forces  
when Mumford incorporated his center in 1984. The wood-paneled 
basement of Mumford's home outside this university town for 15 
years has been the place from which quinacrine is distributed 
around the world free to health care workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumford and Kessel have been able to keep going because  
quinacrine is so cheap; each sterilization costs less than a 
dollar. Only about 15 cents of that cost is for the chemical 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The worldwide efforts of Mumford's center cost $156,000 in 1997,  
according to the center's annual tax report. Mumford salary was 
$50,000 as the center's president. Kessel was paid nothing as 
secretary-treasurer, but runs his own small research outfit which 
also promotes quinacrine. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors gave Mumford's center $782,000 between 1993 and 1997.  
Nonprofits like the center aren't required to identify donors 
except to the IRS. Mumford refused to share his list of 
contributors with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports in the United States and England have linked donors  
to anti-immigration groups. Opponents have used the reports to 
question the center's motives. 
</P>
<P>
	No anti-immigration group backs his center, Mumford said.  
Neither do groups seeking tighter U.S. immigration limits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's groups in India succeeded in banning quinacrine last  
August after 20 years in use. They were suspicious of the chemical 
being distributed by white men from rich countries. Some women in 
India and Vietnam reported not being told they were undergoing 
sterilization. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mumford says quinacrine sterilizations were developed in  
Chile and researched extensively in Vietnam. Local health care 
workers administered it thousands of times in India, Bangladesh and 
Pakistan, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This method was developed in a Third World country, not in the  
U.S.,'' said Mumford, who has a 3-inch-thick stack of studies on 
the drug dating from the 1940s. ``It's a south-to-south thing. Not 
a First-World-to-Third-World thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FHI has since 1994 been conducting follow-up checks with a  
random sample of 1,800 out of nearly 32,000 Vietnamese women 
sterilized with quinacrine. The results haven't been published, but 
an FHI spokesman says researchers have found no obvious health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Adrienne Germaine, president of the International Women's Health  
Coalition in New York, said mankind would be better served by a 
successor to the condom -- a barrier to pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted diseases that women can control. 
</P>
<P>
	But Werner Fornos, president of the Washington-based Population  
Institute, compliments Mumford's determination to champion a method 
too cheap and too long off patent protection to make a drug company 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It strikes many of us that there must be cheaper methods of  
contraception to fulfill the desire of more than 200 million women 
in the world who want no more children -- women who can't afford or 
don't have access to contraceptives,'' said Fornos.

<HEADLINE> McGehee Wins Indy Rookie Honors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Robby McGehee, whose chief mechanic was  
critically injured in a pit accident during the Indianapolis 500, 
was cited tonight as the race's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	A trophy, which he dedicated to injured crewman Steve Fried, and  
a check for $25,000 were presented to McGehee at the annual Victory 
Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried, who suffered head and chest injuries, remained in  
critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit at 
Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to see him today, and he wrote a note,'' said McGehee,  
who finished fifth, the highest of four rookies in the race. ``I 
know he's awake. He asked about whether we were rookie of the year. 
I said we were waiting for tonight, but we kind of thought we may 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee, who started 27th, earned $247,750, plus the $25,000  
rookie prize, for finishing fifth. He completed 199 of the 200 
laps. The other rookies were John Hollansworth Jr., who finished 
13th; Jeret Schroeder, 15th; and Wim Eyckmans, 23rd.

<HEADLINE> One Rafter Dead in Montana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIVIDE, Mont. (AP) -- Rescue workers today searched for a woman  
believed to have died in a weekend rafting accident that killed one 
of her companions. 
</P>
<P>
	Four people were on a raft that went over a dam and capsized  
Sunday in the Big Hole River in southwestern Montana. Sandra 
Townsend, 48, drowned, and Roxie Oaks, 22, was presumed dead. Miss 
Oaks' fiance and another man survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff John McPherson said that if Miss Oaks hadn't drowned,  
she probably would have died from hypothermia in the frigid river, 
which was swollen by snowmelt and recent rains. More than 60 
searchers found no trace of her on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the survivors told authorities the current prevented the  
party from guiding the raft to the riverbank while approaching the 
dam.

<HEADLINE> Organ-Rejection Remedy Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A temporary treatment to block organ rejection  
has remained effective for up to a year so far in monkeys that got 
transplanted kidneys, researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope the experimental treatment will one day free  
some transplant patients from having to take anti-rejection drugs 
for the rest of their lives. The standard drugs suppress the immune 
system and leave patients vulnerable to infections and tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are now planning studies of the experimental  
treatment in people, said Dr. Allan D. Kirk of the Naval Medical 
Research Center in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	He and co-authors describe the monkey study in the June issue of  
the journal Nature Medicine. Two years ago, Kirk and colleagues 
reported on a similar treatment that staved off rejection for more 
than nine months in monkeys. The new treatment includes only one of 
the two substances administered in the prior work. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to teach the immune system to accept the  
transplanted tissue rather than attack it. To do that, researchers 
injected the monkeys with a protein to prevent certain blood cells 
from delivering a ``danger'' signal to other cells, an initial 
event in rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	The protein is called hu5C8. The researchers gave it to nine  
monkeys the morning of the kidney tranplant, just after the 
surgery, about once a week for four weeks after that, and finally 
once a month for five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the nine treated monkeys remain alive and well with no  
organ rejection, researchers report. Two have lived about a year so 
far since the end of treatment, and another more than six months. 
The ninth monkey died from an unrelated cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In a commentary accompanying the article, immune-system expert  
Polly Matzinger of the National Institutes of Health said a 1996 
study had shown the approach works in mice. But transplant 
researchers largely overlooked that report, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well,'' she wrote, ``it is time to pay attention!''

<HEADLINE> Turbulence Rocks American Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- An American Airlines flight hit  
turbulence as it approached Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport 
on Monday, and two flight attendants were slightly injured. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the 72 passengers aboard Flight 2006 was hurt, airline  
spokesman Mark Slitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	The MD-80 flight originated in Seattle and landed at DFW shortly

<P>
	Thunderstorms were moving through the area when the plane, at  
12,000 feet, hit turbulence about 30 miles from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Slitt said the injuries appear minor. One flight attendant  
bumped her head and went to Baylor Medical Center in Grapevine for 
examination. Another scraped her knee and required no medical care.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Resumes on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Microsoft Corp.'s trial resumes for the  
final phase of testimony, the government will urge the judge to 
focus on the software company's aggressive behavior toward 
competitors earlier this decade and on its dominance today. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, though, wants U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield  
Jackson to look to the future, when Microsoft believes its Windows 
software will face unprecedented competition from fledgling 
technologies 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust trial was scheduled to resume Tuesday after a  
13-week recess and despite secret efforts to settle the case. Key 
differences remain, such as how Microsoft can continue adding new 
technology to its the Windows operating system without undercutting 
rivals offering similar software products. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft must convince Jackson that federal intervention is  
unnecessary to maintain the robust high-tech industry robust. The 
company also must minimize the ill effects of its past actions on 
some of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and Microsoft each have identified three  
witnesses who will testify during this phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economist who testified previously for the  
government, was to take the stand again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's most important witness will be Garry Norris, an  
IBM Corp. manager who will describe pressure Microsoft allegedly 
exerted on IBM to sacrifice its rival OS/2 operating-system 
software during the early 1990s. That software competed directly 
with Windows until its popularity waned in late 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last courtroom testimony, America Online Inc.  
finalized its $10 billion purchase of Netscape Communications 
Corp., the Internet pioneer whose Web browser software competes 
with Microsoft's own Internet Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice lawyer David Boies has said Microsoft's emphasis on the  
merger was a sideshow, but the judge remarked previously that the 
deal ``might be a very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that AOL, as the world's largest Internet  
provider, could help revive Netscape's popularity as a browser, and 
that other alliances would encourage development of handheld, 
wireless devices that do not use Windows and could displace 
Microsoft's importance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deposition last month with AOL Chairman Steve Case,  
Microsoft also suggested that future high-speed Internet 
connections for consumers threaten to reduce the industry's 
reliance on Windows.

	Case has taken an unusually high-profile role in recent weeks  
lobbying Congress and federal regulators to force cable companies 
to allow their subscribers to use his AOL software with those

	Software used across such high-speed networks typically can go

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Down in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early  
Tuesday in thin, range-bound dealings. Tokyo stock prices declined. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.68 yen in early trading, up 0.32 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo. Currency markets in New York were closed 
Monday for a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 75.25 points,  
or 0.47 percent, to 16,03.40 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On 
Monday, the average closed up 138.97 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar got a small boost after the  
Management and Coordination Agency announced Japan's jobless rate 
stood at a record high 4.8 percent in April, unchanged from March. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the number of jobless people rose to a new record high  
of 3.42 million, the overall unemployment rate was slightly below 
the 4.9 percent which many economists had forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dollar-yen is stuck in a range, and it is hard to imagine it  
breaking out during Asian trading,'' said Hajime Sato, assistant 
general manager of the treasury department at Daiwa International 
Trust Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.75 yen, down  
from 128.31 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, profit-taking in reaction to the previous  
day's advance pushed the Nikkei average lower in early trading, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the latest jobless figure may put less pressure on  
the government to do more to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data may tone down calls for additional government  
stimulus measures,'' said Naoki Takahashi, manager at Marusan 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they expected the Tokyo market to remain in a  
narrow range Tuesday with no other fresh market-moving news 
following the overnight holidays in the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 2.33 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,294.86. 
The TOPIX closed down 5.12 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.4500 percent from Monday's finish of 1.4750 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.56 yen from 99.34 yen.

<HEADLINE> Breakdown by Region of Travel Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A look at results of an Associated Press poll on travel by  
region: 

</P>
<P>
	 *NORTHEAST   	
</P>
<P>
	Just about half in the Northeast travel by car on vacation and  
four-out-of-10 travel by plane, more than the people in the South 
and North Central regions, but about the same as the West. A 
quarter of the people living in the Northeast say they will spend 
$3,000 or more on vacations this year. 

</P>
<P>
	 *NORTH CENTRAL   	
</P>
<P>
	Almost half of the people from this region said they would spend  
between $500 and $1,500 on vacation. More than half say they will 
travel by car and about three out of 10 say they plan to fly. 

</P>
<P>
	 *SOUTH   	
</P>
<P>
	Almost two-thirds of Southerners travel by car when on vacation,  
the highest percentage of any region. More than a quarter expect to 
take their longest vacation for less than a week, while almost half 
will take a week. A third of the people in the South say they will 
spend $500 or less on vacation, the most in any region who plan to 
spend that amount. 

</P>
<P>
	 *WEST    	
</P>
<P>
	Four out of 10 say they plan to fly on vacation. A fourth say  
they will vacation for at least two weeks and a fifth of the 
Westerners said they will vacation for three weeks or more. That is 
twice as many as the number of Southerners who said they will 
vacation for three weeks or more.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled more flights  
Monday as pilots called in sick to protest a proposed pay cut. 
Neither side appeared willing to reopen negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since pulling out of talks with the pilots last week, Cathay has  
canceled a total of 103 flights, including 33 on Monday, affecting 
more than 10,000 travelers. The carrier has chartered flights from 
other regional airlines to transport its passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day disruption has hurt Hong Kong's tourism industry,  
which had been recovering from a lull due to Asia's financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hong Kong could not afford to have its flag-carrier airline  
turning passengers away,'' a statement from the semi-official Hong 
Kong Tourist Association said. Cathay accounts for a third of all 
Hong Kong flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and its pilots have been locked in a dispute since  
Cathay asked senior pilots in March to take an 8 percent pay cut in 
exchange for stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Cathay abruptly pulled out of nine weeks of talks and  
gave the pilots a June 11 deadline to decide whether to accept a 
revised pay offer, including a smaller pay cut and better stock 
options, resign or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong carrier dismissed the pilots' counteroffer, which  
included annual pay increases after two years of cuts and a 
year-long pay freeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots have been calling in sick en masse since Friday, claiming  
they are under too much stress because of the layoff threats. Union 
officials denied they had organized the strike, saying Hong Kong 
law allows pilots to stay home due to stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Esther Lam, a spokeswoman for Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung  
Chee-hwa, said labor officials were eager to bring both sides back 
to the negotiating table. A government statement said officials 
hope they could resolve the dispute to avoid further flight 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither side appeared willing to back down.  
</P>
<P>
	Cathay spokesman Tony Tyler said the company would not reopen  
talks unless the pilots agree to forgo demands for guaranteed pay 
increases. But John Findlay, secretary-general for the Hong Kong 
Aircrew Officers Association, said the union would submit no new 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay has stopped taking bookings since late Friday for flights  
flying from now to June 17. The airline has been trying to cut 
costs since it lost $69 million last year -- its first loss in 35 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay's shares were badly hit Monday, the first trading day  
since the flight cancellations started. The company's stock tumbled 
9.8 percent even while the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 
percent.

<HEADLINE>  Weary Stewart Running on Empty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Tony Stewart isn't seeing double anymore.  
His stomach is settling down and he can stand up again without 
feeling like he's going to pass out. 
</P>
<P>
	Back to normal, right? Well, as normal as he can expect to feel  
a day after driving nearly 1,100 miles in about 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a lot better,'' he said Monday night. ``(But) I haven't  
felt right all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop him from another day of high-tailing it across  
the country, though. Stewart, who on Sunday became the first driver 
to complete the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in one day, 
was up around 8 a.m. EDT on Monday and back on a plane about three 
hours later for another short hop to Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived at the drivers' awards dinner a few hours later  
looking relaxed and in far better shape than he did Sunday, when he 
collapsed after climbing out of his car at the Coca-Cola. He 
grabbed A.J. Foyt from behind in a bear hug, and fellow drivers 
congratulated him. A woman he didn't even know came up to tell him 
she admired his endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all just kind of a unique experience,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wrapped up his double quest in spectacular fashion  
Sunday night, charging from last to fourth in the Coca-Cola after 
finishing ninth at Indy. The finish moved him to fifth in the 
Winston Cup point standings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long day took its toll. Aside from two small bagels for  
breakfast and a couple of Power Bars, he didn't eat all day and was 
sick for the last 100 laps. As he climbed out of his Pontiac in 
front of a crowd of friends and media, his legs gave out. He sat 
next to his car for several minutes looking dazed before he was put 
on a stretcher and taken to the track hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused intravenous fluids, so doctors gave him water and  
Gatorade and cooled him down with ice packs. He was released after 
about 30 minutes and went back to his trailer to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good when I got out of the car at Indy. Physically, I  
didn't feel real bad,'' he said. ``About lap 80, I was starting to 
feel sick because I was getting hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two drivers had tried the double before Stewart, who drove  
in the Indy Racing League for three years before switching to 
NASCAR's Winston Cup Circuit this season. Now he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent three hours in his Indy car, gripping the steering  
wheel and trying to tame its handling problems while whipping 
around the track at 200 mph. When he finished -- four laps behind 
winner Kenny Brack -- he was whisked away on a golf cart to a 
helicopter waiting in the infield near turn three. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flown to the Indianapolis airport, where his sponsor,  
Home Depot, had its private jet waiting for the 65-minute flight to 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart changed into his NASCAR driving suit and caught a quick  
nap on the flight, stretching out on the couch in the back of the 
jet after guzzling water and Powerade to rehydrate. Then it was 
into another helicopter for a quick flight to Lowe's Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	All that, and he still had another 600 miles to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was too hard to do,'' he said. ``That made for a very  
long day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Stewart probably will stick to the Coca-Cola next year and  
leave Indy to the full-time open-wheel drivers. But he's glad he 
did the double at least once. He got chills when he heard the 
strains of ``Taps'' play at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he arrived at the Coca-Cola, some 150,000 fans stood  
and gave a deafening cheer as the helicopter flew low around the 
speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely worth doing once,'' he said. ``The crowds'  
response at both places was definitely the highlight of the day.''

<HEADLINE> Watson Warms to Memorial Memories  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- The rain slashed across the course and 30  
mph winds made it feel as if it were 13 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	A perfect day for golf for Tom Watson.  
</P>
<P>
	The Memorial Tournament resumes this week, but 20 years ago  
Watson put together a round in this event that still amazes. 
</P>
<P>
	He shot a 3-under-par 69 in the second round in 1979. The total  
seems nothing special, but consider that the rest of the star field 
averaged 79, and 42 of the 107 players couldn't break 80. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the weather gets real bad a lot of times, you feel like  
you've got about half the field beat,'' Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Maltbie, who won the inaugural Memorial three years  
earlier, shot a 50 on the back nine and finished at 92, the highest 
totals ever at the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``My hands were so cold I couldn't even feel the club,'' Craig  
Stadler said after shooting an 80. ``You really couldn't even 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller Barber remained in contention with a 73.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst,'' he said. ``I've played a lot of rounds  
when the wind has blown hard, and a lot of rounds when it rained, 
and a few when it was cold. But never all together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Lietzke thanked the tournament volunteers for not  
deserting their posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Levi shot an 84 -- and made the cut. Ben Crenshaw (82),  
Mark McCumber (83), Jerry Pate (85) and defending champ Jim Simons 
(79) couldn't get under the 36-hole cut of 13-over 157. That's the 
highest cut since the PGA Tour started keeping track in 1970, and 
all three have taken place at the Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament founder and course designer Jack Nicklaus said he  
hasn't seen many days like that on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some days as cold, and maybe some snowy days,'' he  
said. ``But that was a tough day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson didn't have a bogey and later said, ``It wasn't all that  
bad out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah, right.  
</P>
<P>
	The players had complained about the rain and wind during the  
first round. Lanny Wadkins shot a 69, with the 29-year-old Watson 
four strokes back and trailing seven players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember after that first round I was talking to one player,  
who will go unnamed, and he said, 'How do you do it, Tom?' I said, 
'Do what?' He said, 'Well, how do you hold it together?' I said, 
'Well, the one thing I do is that when things get going badly, I 
don't give up,''' Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next day that player got to the first tee and he withdrew  
because the weather was so bad,'' Watson said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	A frigid storm front had hit Muirfield Village Golf Club,  
turning away fans and turning the tournament into the Hypothermia 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have a very good rainsuit, so that morning I went out  
and bought a rainsuit and some cold-weather clothes,'' Watson 
recalled. ``I didn't bring any cold-weather clothes, like an 
idiot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing a stocking cap and pulling on thick gloves between  
shots, Watson had to hit a 2-iron into the first green, which 
usually requires a short iron. On the second hole, he hit a 1-iron 
to the green, a half-dozen clubs more than the norm. He parred both 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	He followed with birdies at the fifth and sixth, then closed the  
round with a birdie for his 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson didn't stick around to soak up the mitten-deadened  
applause of a few hard-core fans in the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you kidding?'' he said. ``I wanted to get in that  
clubhouse and get off that golf course.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watson grew up in Missouri, where the winds and temperatures can  
be brutal. He learned how to keep the ball down in a headwind and 
to carve it into a crosswind. While others wintered in California 
and Florida, he practiced against the elements. No surprise he 
would win five British Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was used to it,'' he said. ``When things are going well, you  
don't really think about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 69 vaulted him to a four-stroke lead. He played the last two  
rounds in 1-under to beat Barber by three strokes and Bob Gilder by 
six. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody can play well when the weather's right,'' Watson said.  
``But the weather and the wind and the cold -- you add those 
elements to the golf course, an especially difficult one like 
Muirfield Village. ... To conquer it, that gives you a great 
feeling of satisfaction.''

<HEADLINE> Treatment May Stop HIV From Hiding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A special therapy might be able to flush the  
AIDS virus out of blood cells where it hides in the body, according 
to scientists who stress that much more work is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The work -- presented in the June issue of the journal Nature  
Medicine -- was reported by The Associated Press in November, when 
it was presented at a scientific meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Treatment for HIV infection can drive the virus down to  
undetectable levels in the blood. But HIV can still hide in some 
inactive blood cells called T cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The new work was aimed at activating these cells so HIV would  
emerge, the cells would die and the HIV would be stymied by 
standard drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the National Institutes of Health reported on  
14 patients getting standard HIV treatment and the cell-stimulator 
interleukin-2. No HIV could be recovered from T cells in three of 
these patients, or in lymph node tissue from two of these three. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the researchers said HIV might still be hiding  
elsewhere in the body. They also said it will take a different kind 
of study, in which patients are randomly assigned to get 
interleukin-2 treatment or not, to test the effect of the 
treatment.

<HEADLINE> Sun's Weather May Add to Y2K Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Computer date confusion about the Year 2000 is  
not the only problem Earth's technology is going to face when the 
new year rolls in. Astronomers say they're also worried about an 
angry sun. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, just as computers around the world are coping with  
the Y2K bug, the sun will enter the most violent and disruptive 
phase of its 11-year cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Massive bursts of energy from the sun could mean celebrating the  
new millennium in the dark, with dead cellular phones. Ships and 
planes relying on satellites for navigation might have to haul out 
old-fashioned maps. Even spacewalking astronauts could be at risk, 
according to reports Monday at the national meeting of the American 
Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers, using new techniques, are forecasting the sun's  
cycle to peak during the months of January to April. The sun is 
expected to be busy with solar flares and coronal mass ejections -- 
solar explosions that can equal a million 100 megaton hydrogen 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves of solar energy can trigger power blackouts, block some  
radio communications and create phantom commands capable of sending 
satellites spinning out of their proper orbits. 
</P>
<P>
	There were two pieces of good news: The solar cycle is not  
expected to be as severe as some in the past, and, for the first 
time, there may be some warning, thanks to a government satellite 
that will detect bursts of solar energy and send about an hour's 
notice, said JoAnn Joselyn of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning, posted on the Internet and relayed through a  
special system, will give power companies time to align circuits to 
minimize or avoid damage from electrical surges, she said. 
Satellite operators can power down equipment or prepare to send 
corrective signals to their spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have plotted 23 solar cycles, using historic and  
modern measurements. But the current cycle may be the most 
disruptive ever because much of the vulnerable communications 
technology now in use is new and has not been exposed to maximum 
solar activity, Joselyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The explosion in technology is intersecting with an extremely  
disturbed space environment,'' Joselyn said. ``There is much higher 
risk now because we depend more on technology that is vulnerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joselyn said energy bursts from the sun can cause an electrical  
charge to build up on the surface of satellites, triggering phantom 
signals. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier solar cycle, she said, small rocket thrusters on a  
satellite suddenly started firing, sending the spacecraft out of 
position. Control of another satellite was lost when its gyroscopes 
were disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	Joselyn said cellular telephones may be vulnerable because they  
can use the ionosphere -- the region of electrically charged gases 
in the upper atmosphere -- to send radio signals, and bursts from 
the sun can disturb the ionosphere. Some cellular phone systems 
depend on satellites that are at risk too. 
</P>
<P>
	Solar energy eruptions can cause warm air to surge up from the  
Earth. That can drag some satellites to lower orbits, forcing 
satellite operators to use rocket fuel to reposition the 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide navigation, for ships and airplanes, relies heavily on  
the Global Positioning Satellite system, which uses a fleet of 
satellites that can be affected by the sun, Joselyn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am worried about the GPS more than anything else,'' she  
said. ``We're starting to land airplanes with that system now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Electromagnetic energy from the sun can send huge waves of  
electrical energy surging along power lines, shorting circuits and 
burning out equipment. A 1989 solar storm caused a province-wide 
blackout in Quebec, and coils in a transformer station in Salem, 
N.J., melted and caught fire, causing a regional outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts generally are safe inside the space shuttle or the  
International Space Station, but future missions to the moon or 
Mars will have to guard to solar radiation bursts. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the moon, they could get enough radiation to be lethal,''  
said Joselyn. ``If we fly to Mars, we'll have to consider the 
hazardous radiation from the sun.''

<HEADLINE> Temps May Not Stay Temps for Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MindSpring Enterprises, a fast-growing Internet provider,  
increasingly relies on a temp agency to supply a stream of workers 
for its call-in centers. But the company is careful to offer them 
staff jobs, or replace them after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a growing number of companies, Atlanta-based MindSpring  
uses temporary workers to cut costs and solve labor shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	But temporary workers are increasingly demanding employee  
benefits if they work as long and hard as permanent workers, 
compelling wary businesses like MindSpring to take steps so temps 
don't become de facto employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A closely watched court battle between Microsoft Corp. and its  
longtime temps -- dubbed ``permatemps'' -- is the most visible sign 
of this growing workplace issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest twist to the case, a U.S. appeals court panel  
ruled in mid-May that thousands of former temps should have been 
allowed to join the company's lucrative stock-purchase program. 
Last Wednesday, Microsoft asked the full appeals court to review 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was the first to hold that temps can look to both  
their agency and their work-site employer for benefits. It raises 
the specter that employers will be liable for everything from 
temps' benefits to their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It's) is another reminder ... that they just can't change the  
label or badge and turn them into a non-employee,'' said Catherine 
Ruckelshaus, litigation director at the National Employment Law 
Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, the percentage of temps has quadrupled to 2.2  
percent of all workers, according to forthcoming data from the 
Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. On 
any given day, about 1.3 million temps are at work, spawning an 
estimated $60 billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 90 percent of U.S. companies use temps, often because they  
provide a flexible, quick and cheaper source of labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Temps, who are mostly women, are clustered in low-paying work,  
such as secretarial jobs and most would prefer a permanent job. Few 
get health insurance or other benefits from their agencies, 
according to Economic Policy Institute studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft temps have filed a number of lawsuits against the  
company. Along with the suit seeking stock-purchase rights, the 
temps are suing for health insurance and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach responds that temp agency  
employees look to their agencies for wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that Microsoft employees work for Microsoft  
and employees of temp agencies work for temp agencies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many employers aren't so sure that the lines of  
responsibility are clear anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some courts have defined a ``common-law employee'' as a worker  
who's spent more than five months at a company, substantially under 
the employers' control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get calls regularly on this issue, asking `How do we make  
this determination,''' said Michael Bartlett, manager of labor law 
policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``There are serious 
liability concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, companies are tightening contracts to more clearly  
exclude temps from benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have established internal ``temp agencies'' that assign  
roving permanent workers to different projects. Others have leased 
some of their operations to outside firms rather than bringing in 
temps. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring, the Internet provider, reluctantly began using temps  
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so antithetical to our philosophy of how a good company  
operates,'' said vice president Carter Calle, explaining that 
MindSpring wants to rely on permanent employees who have a stake in 
the company due to stock options and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now MindSpring uses a staffing agency to recruit, screen and  
hire temps, then -- to prevent ``permatemping'' -- makes sure they're 
either hired or let go after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Temp agencies, as well, should do more for their workers,  
advocacy groups say. A coalition of such groups, including the 
national working women's group 9 to 5, will unveil a national code 
of conduct for temp agencies in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to raise the bar, and improve practices through  
voluntary action,'' said Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the coalition is helping a community group  
monitor the industry, with plans to publicize model temp agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a strategy applauded by Kamal Larsuel, a 29-year-old  
engineer who's been working as a Microsoft temp for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft needs to put their foot down and say, `If you want  
to be a preferred agency with Microsoft, you need to provide us 
with better benefits,'' she suggested. ``That would be the smart 
thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Joseph Not Great Against Sabres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Goaltender Curtis Joseph, a superhero for the  
Toronto Maple Leafs all season long, came dowm to earth in the 
Eastern Conference final against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Cujo was weak or substandard during Toronto's five-game  
loss to the Sabres. He just didn't steal any games like he did 
several times this season and earlier in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs played their best game of the series in the 4-2  
loss in Game 5 on Monday night. They dominated at times and 
probably deserved to win, but fortuitous goals by the Sabres ended 
Toronto's season. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Rasmussen scored the winning goal at 11:35 of the third  
period when he backhanded a Brian Holzinger rebound past Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game was indicative of the series,'' said Joseph. ``A  
backhander, one-timer, top shelf. You don't see those go in every 
day. It wasn't even close to the middle of the net. Buffalo really 
was a team of destiny all series. They made their shots when they 
had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Toronto's previous series against the Philadelphia Flyers  
and Pittsburgh Penguins, when Joseph was bordering on the 
spectacular with a .930 save percentage, the Vezina Trophy finalist 
wasn't at his best against Buffalo. His save percentage in the five 
games against the Sabres was just .850. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody was pointing the finger at Cujo in the series. Quite the  
contrary. They defended his play all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cujo is the reason why this team got this close to the Stanley  
Cup final,'' said forward Kris King. ``He's a fabulous player and 
he's as good a person as he is a player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Cujo was able to win us some games this year when maybe we  
didn't deserve it,'' said center Steve Sullivan. ``He's a much 
better goalie than I expected he would be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn called Joseph ``a rock all year.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He was determined all series, but we weren't as good as we  
needed to be.''

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Alaskan Raft Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two Georgia women drowned during a  
weekend river rafting trip just outside Denali National Park and 
Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rafting accident in Montana left one woman dead and  
another missing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alaska, Eloise Hubbard, 75 of Doraville, Ga., and Doris  
North, 75, of Decatur, Ga., were on a 13-mile scenic tour Saturday 
of the Nenana River, which forms the eastern border of the park, 
175 miles north of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	When their raft got caught in a whirlpool, the women were thrown  
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``They hit a swell in the water and then went into a whirlpool.  
The raft was literally just sucked down,'' said Alaska State 
Trooper Bill Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
	The other passengers who shared the raft with the women managed  
to remain inside. Nine people were treated for mild hypothermia and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had planned this trip for a year,'' Mrs. Hubbard's  
18-year-old grandson, Chris Ryan, told The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution. ``She always took care of me and my mother. 
She never had a bad word to say about anyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tour company, Alaska Raft Adventure, suspended its rafting  
operations indefinitely and was investigating the circumstances 
that led to the accident, said Bob Seney, a manager with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Near Divide, in southwestern Montana, four people were on a raft  
that capsized Sunday afternoon in the cold, swift-running Big Hole 
River. One died and another was missing and presumed dead. The 
search for her was called off for the night at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, she's been in there five hours, and we've gone from  
a rescue mode to a recovery (of a body),'' Butte-Silver Bow County 
Sheriff John McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four, two men and two women, were unable to guide the raft  
to the river bank in the strong current as it approached the Divide 
Pumphouse Dam, officials said. The raft capsized as it went over 
the dam. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men got out of the water but the river carried the women  
ahead of them. Names of the rafters were not released Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson said the river is far too swift for rafters at this  
point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a good idea to be rafting on that river tonight,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Cancels Flights in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled 31 flights  
Sunday, a quarter of its total daily flight schedule, after pilots 
called in sick amid a dispute over pay cuts and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots have been staying home since Friday when the Hong  
Kong-based airline halted nine weeks of negotiations. Cathay has 
given the pilots until June 11 to choose whether to take a pay cut, 
retire early or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the carrier asked its senior pilots to take an 8  
percent pay cut in exchange for stock options after it took its 
first losses in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials denied they had organized for the pilots to call  
in sick in an effort to force Cathay to reopen negotiations, but 
said they would not rule out future strike actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay officials refused to disclose how many pilots had called  
in sick. Some pilots have taken sick days saying they are too 
stressed by the layoff threats. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flight cancelations announced by the airline came  
after it canceled 30 flights Saturday, affecting 5,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has stopped taking bookings since late Friday for  
flights flying in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay lost $69 million last year and has been trying to cut  
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' pay dispute follows Cathay's recent battle with its  
flight attendants, who eventually conceded to management demands 
that they work more hours in exchange for a pay increase.

<HEADLINE> Schools Get Rid of Outdated Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In some California school libraries, John F.  
Kennedy is still president, the Soviet Union never collapsed and 
man never went to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades of fiscal problems have left many schools with outdated  
books. Only now -- with a chunk of new funding finally available -- 
have librarians begun clearing deadwood from their shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weeding is starting to happen all across the state,'' said  
Barbara Jeffus, a school librarian consultant for the California 
Department of Education. ``It didn't happen before because schools 
were afraid that if they weeded out books, there would be nothing 
left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As state funding for schools shrank in the 1980s and early  
1990s, so did budgets for libraries. Less than a decade ago, the 
state's school libraries were named ``the worst of the worst'' by 
the American Library Association. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, $158.5 million in state funding will supply school  
libraries with new books and materials. At about $28 per student, 
it is California's single largest allocation ever for school 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	State schools Superintendent Delaine Eastin said she keeps a  
``little shelf of horrors'' in her Sacramento office, a collection 
of books taken from school libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	One is called ``I'm Glad I'm A Boy! I'm Glad I'm A Girl!''  
</P>
<P>
	``Boys are doctors. Girls are nurses,'' the book instructs.  
``Boys are presidents. Girls are first ladies. Boys fix things. 
Girls need things fixed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of books have been removed from elementary  
schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, district librarians wearing surgical gloves went  
through dusty volumes at Colfax Elementary School in North 
Hollywood and removed more than half of the 6,400 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were science books from the 1950s, including one with  
this startling prediction: ``Someday man will land on the moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 1938 book on American history contained illustrations of  
American Indians in which they are colored brick red, and stories 
of happy slaves ``working hard and singing on the plantations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some discarded books, especially fiction, find their way into  
classrooms. Others simply are tossed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As hard as it seems, sometimes it's better to throw out a  
book,'' said David Loertscher, a professor of library and 
information sciences at San Jose State University who is helping to 
compile a state survey on library book weeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who needs books on savage Indians and happy slaves?'' he said.  
``We could give the books to Third World countries, but they 
probably have better books than California schools.''

<HEADLINE>  Indy Winner Talks Soft, Drives Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- For Kenny Brack, winning the Indianapolis  
500 was a goal, not his life's ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really got to get myself some new goals now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Those would include winning another IRL title and, who knows,  
maybe another Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he does, he'll have a lot more money to do it with.  
</P>
<P>
	Brack won his first Indy on Sunday, then Monday night received a  
check for $1,465,190 from a record purse of $9,047,150, the biggest 
prize package in auto racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The former record was $8,722,150 from last year's race.  
</P>
<P>
	The prizes were distributed at the Victory Celebration, where  
Robby McGehee was honored as rookie of the year and won $247,750 
for his fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Ward, who finished second to Brack, earned $583,150, and  
Billy Boat, Brack's teammate, took home $435,200 for third. Robby 
Gordon, who lost the lead when he ran out of fuel with just over 
one lap to go, finished fourth and earned $253,270. 
</P>
<P>
	Arie Luyendyk, who started from the pole but crashed while  
leading on the 118th lap, received $382,350 for 22nd, his worst 
finish in 15 Indy starts. It was the final race for the Flying 
Dutchman, who is retiring as the Indy career money-leader with 
almost $5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack earned the victory, but it's been car owner A.J. Foyt who  
has taken center stage for much of the celebration. That's just 
fine with Brack. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we rode around the track on the victory lap, I don't  
think I heard my name screamed once,'' he said earlier Monday, 
smiling at his owner. Foyt was the first to drive to four Indy 
victories and now, thanks to his mostly unheralded driver, owns a 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack looked tired and talked softly, appearing a bit  
uncomfortable after a night of interviews and celebration and a 
morning photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been chaotic,'' he said. ``It's been a lot of fun, but I  
can't take too many days of this. Besides, I've got a race in a 
week and I've got to start focusing on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's typical of Brack, a 33-year-old driver who displays  
little of the cockiness of most racing stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight, blond Swede leaves the brash talk to Foyt, a  
64-year-old Texan with a down-home twang and a penchant for 
outrageous remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the winner of what many still perceive as the world's  
most prestigious race, Brack could become a household name. 
</P>
<P>
	He even got a phone call from the King of Sweden following his  
big win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice of him to call and it's nice to get all the  
attention,'' he said. ``But I don't care about that. I race because 
I want to win races. That's why I'm in this business. If winning 
this race makes me a household name in America and other parts of 
the world, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Brack won three races on the way to his championship.  
Still, he remained a virtual unknown to most of this country -- 
until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in Sweden, Brack's career goal was to reach Formula  
One. 
</P>
<P>
	His apprenticeship was spent in road racing and his future  
seemed assured in the mid-90s when he was hired as a Formula One 
test driver, first by Williams and then Arrows. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he suddenly popped up in this country, driving Indy cars  
for Rick Galles, first in CART and then in the rival IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	His first Indy 500 was in 1997, sort of. He was caught up in a  
crash on the warmup lap, finishing 33rd without ever taking the 
green flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least that gave me some experience,'' Brack said with a  
shrug. ``Last year, when I drove for A.J. was really the first time 
I ran in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that one, he finished sixth and might have had a shot at  
winning had not the team miscalculated fuel mileage early in the 
race, running him dry and costing him a lap he never made up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Brack won after Gordon ran out of fuel.  
</P>
<P>
	Foyt has been around racing long enough to know that luck comes  
and goes without warning. But he also knows it's essential to have 
a good driver who can take advantage of the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody laughed at me when I hired him,'' Foyt said. ``I  
knew he could drive a race car. Now everybody knows it.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Observes Memorial Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- On the century's final Memorial Day,  
President Clinton ventured among slopes of tombstones at Arlington 
National Cemetery and asked Americans to reconsider their 
ambivalence about Kosovo: ``Remember why many of the people are 
laying in these graves out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, the president said, ``is a very small province in a  
small country. But it is a big test of what we believe in -- our 
commitment to leave to our children a world where people are not 
uprooted and ravaged and slaughtered en masse because of their 
race, their ethnicity or their religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the NATO campaign against ethnic cleansing in  
Kosovo the central theme of his traditional Memorial Day address 
Monday at the cemetery's amphitheater. Beyond its marble walls, 
each of the 250,000 small white gravemarkers covering 200 rolling 
green acres had been decorated with an American flag for the 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``From Concord to Corregidor, from Korea to Khe Sanh, from  
Kuwait to Kosovo, our entire history is written in this ground,'' 
Clinton observed. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, he continued, the United States seeks to close the  
20th century with a Europe at peace -- ``which will ensure we will 
not have to send large numbers of young Americans to hie there in 
the next century in a war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a 30-minute morning call from Russian Prime Minister  
Sergei Stepashin to Clinton, to discuss suggestions that Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic may be closer to accepting NATO 
demands for peace, White House officials said no diplomatic 
breakthrough appeared imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	And, to his sun-warmed audience of uniformed veterans and their  
families, Clinton firmly repeated alliance demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kosovars will go home. The Serb forces will withdraw. An  
international force, with NATO at its core, will deploy to protect 
all the people -- including the Serb minority -- in Kosovo,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Along his motorcade route across the Potomac River, a handful of  
protesters hoisted signs such as ``Bring our troops home'' and ``No 
NATO invasion in Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, several  
veterans wondered about the United States' role in the airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just can't be the world's policemen,'' said Stephen Jasko,  
who fought in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Wayne Miller, a former helicopter pilot: ``I'm torn. We  
can't let things like Kosovo happen, but I wish I had more 
confidence'' in the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in his remarks, acknowledged public misgivings.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know that many Americans believe that this is not our fight.  
But remember why many of the people are laying in these graves out 
here -- because of what happened in Europe, and because of what was 
allowed to go on too long before people intervened. What we are 
doing today will save lives, including American lives, in the 
future and it will give our children a better, safer world to live 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo dominates the president's schedule for the week. The  
conflict is expected to be the centerpiece of his commencement 
address Wednesday at the United States Air Force Academy. And on 
Thursday, Clinton is due to convene a Cabinet meeting and review 
the Kosovo campaign in a private meeting with his military advisory 
panel, the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Clinton sounded a defensive note as reports -- denied  
by NATO -- came from the state-run news agency in Belgrade, 
Yugoslavia, that NATO missiles struck a sanitarium and retirement 
home, killing civilians. 
</P>
<P>
	Without reference to any specific report, Clinton said that the  
American pilots and crews flying over Serbia ``risk their lives 
every day and they even avoid firing back sometimes at people who 
fire at them because they fire from heavily populated areas and 
they want to avoid killing innocent civilians.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Bill Would Allow Spanking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- The Legislature sent Gov. Kenny Guinn a  
bill that would ensure parents can spank their children and erase 
official records of such incidents if they're not deemed to be 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Assembly on Sunday voted 24-17 in favor of the bill, which  
was approved by the Senate a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents need to know they won't get locked up for disciplining  
their children, supporters of the measure said. But critics argued 
that a record is vital to identifying abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is your evidence that parents are afraid to spank their  
children? In my line of work, I see too many parents that do beat 
their children,'' said Assemblywoman Sheila Leslie, a Democrat and 
former director of a nonprofit child advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics focused on a provision that would allow official records  
to be destroyed if the parent's action falls short of the legal 
description of ``physical injury,'' which includes a sprain or 
dislocation, damage to cartilage, fractures, temporary 
disfigurement and internal injury.

	Bombs Kill 16 Yugoslav Civilians  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO missiles killed at least 16  
people when they smashed into a hospital and a retirement home 
today in Yugoslavia, said Serb officials, amid growing concern 
about civilian casualties from the alliance's bombing campaign. The 
alliance acknowledged striking a military barracks and an 
ammunition storage area in the area around Surdulica, 220 miles 
southeast of Belgrade, but would not confirm hitting the civilian 
sites and the reports of casualties. Condemning the ``murdering of 
civilians'' in Serbia, President Slobodan Milosevic said the latest 
attacks endangered fragile peace efforts.

	Colombia Won't Talk to Rebels  
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The government today rejected further  
peace contacts with rebels until 85 hostages seized from a plane 
and a church are released. In the latest abduction, about 30 
members of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, barged into the La 
Maria church yesterday and tricked the worshippers into their 
trucks by claiming a bomb was in the building. The rebels abandoned 
84 of the worshippers to pursuing troops and fled into the 
mountains, an army chief said. Last month, the ELN hijacked an 
Avianca Airlines flight and it is holding 25 people captive from 
that incident.

<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Working fast, astronauts fixed a  
broken radio, replaced flawed battery packs and installed foam 
mufflers over noisy fans today aboard the new international space 
station. They launched into the repairs within minutes of entering 
the 77-foot orbiting complex late yesterday. Several hours later, 
much of the work was done. The astronauts have until Thursday to 
finish the repairs and unload 1 1/2 tons of tools, spare parts, 
computers, water and clothes into the station's two compartments. 
The hatches will be sealed Thursday, and Discovery will pull away 
Thursday night.

	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Congolese rebels and Rwandan forces shot  
down two MiG fighters today after they attacked positions in 
southern Congo, a Rwandan leader said. The violence came despite a 
unilateral cease-fire called by Rwanda. Vice President Paul Kagame 
also urged Congo to start talking directly to the Congolese rebels, 
who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda, and declare a cease-fire. The 
Zimbabwean MiG fighters, flying in support of the Congolese 
government, were shot down during two separate attacks, Kagame 
said. The pilots were killed when their planes crashed in Manono 
and Eshimba in southern Congo, officials said.

	EU Lifts Sanctions on Nigeria  
</P>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- The European Union today announced it was  
lifting economic sanctions against Nigeria following the 
inauguration of a civilian government. The EU imposed sanctions on 
Nigeria in 1995 during the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, whose regime 
became a pariah as a result of state-sponsored human rights abuses. 
Abacha's death a year ago paved the way for the democratic 
transition, which culminated in Saturday's inauguration of Olusegun 
Obasanjo, the winner of elections in February.

	Britain Revives Cheeserolling Race  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Runners tore down a 300-yard course in pursuit of  
an 8-pound double Gloucester cheese wheel today at a revival of the 
custom of cheeserolling. The person who crosses the finish line 
right behind the fast-rolling wheel gets to keep it. Stephen Brain, 
30, of Gloucester, won all three men's races at Cooper's Hill near 
Gloucester, 115 miles west of London. According to ``The Customs 
and Ceremonies of Britain,'' cheeserolling was once an event at 
spring celebrations.

including the game-winner with nine seconds left, as San Antonio 
came from 18 points down in the third quarter to beat the stunned

	MIAMI (AP) -- Edgar Renteria, Kent Bottenfield and a TV replay  
helped the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Florida Marlins 5-2 today. 
Former Marlins World Series hero Renteria hit a pair of solo homers 
against his ex-teammates, while Bottenfield pitched five innings 
and improved to 8-2, tying him for the NL lead in victories. 
Television also had a rare role: The Marlins played the game under 
protest after the umpiring crew consulted a TV replay before 
changing a call, costing Florida a run.

<HEADLINE>  Indy Winner Talks Soft, Drives Hard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- For Kenny Brack, winning the Indianapolis  
500 was a goal, not his life's ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've really got to get myself some new goals now,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Those would include winning another IRL title and, who knows,  
maybe another Indy 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he does, he'll have a lot more money to do it with.  
</P>
<P>
	Brack won his first Indy on Sunday, then Monday night received a  
check for $1,465,190 from a record purse of $9,047,150, the biggest 
prize package in auto racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	The former record was $8,722,150 from last year's race.  
</P>
<P>
	The prizes were distributed at the Victory Celebration, where  
Robby McGehee was honored as rookie of the year and won $247,750 
for his fifth-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Ward, who finished second to Brack, earned $583,150, and  
Billy Boat, Brack's teammate, took home $435,200 for third. Robby 
Gordon, who lost the lead when he ran out of fuel with just over 
one lap to go, finished fourth and earned $253,270. 
</P>
<P>
	Arie Luyendyk, who started from the pole but crashed while  
leading on the 118th lap, received $382,350 for 22nd, his worst 
finish in 15 Indy starts. It was the final race for the Flying 
Dutchman, who is retiring as the Indy career money-leader with 
almost $5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack earned the victory, but it's been car owner A.J. Foyt who  
has taken center stage for much of the celebration. That's just 
fine with Brack. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we rode around the track on the victory lap, I don't  
think I heard my name screamed once,'' he said earlier Monday, 
smiling at his owner. Foyt was the first to drive to four Indy 
victories and now, thanks to his mostly unheralded driver, owns a 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack looked tired and talked softly, appearing a bit  
uncomfortable after a night of interviews and celebration and a 
morning photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been chaotic,'' he said. ``It's been a lot of fun, but I  
can't take too many days of this. Besides, I've got a race in a 
week and I've got to start focusing on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's typical of Brack, a 33-year-old driver who displays  
little of the cockiness of most racing stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The slight, blond Swede leaves the brash talk to Foyt, a  
64-year-old Texan with a down-home twang and a penchant for 
outrageous remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as the winner of what many still perceive as the world's  
most prestigious race, Brack could become a household name. 
</P>
<P>
	He even got a phone call from the King of Sweden following his  
big win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nice of him to call and it's nice to get all the  
attention,'' he said. ``But I don't care about that. I race because 
I want to win races. That's why I'm in this business. If winning 
this race makes me a household name in America and other parts of 
the world, I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Brack won three races on the way to his championship.  
Still, he remained a virtual unknown to most of this country -- 
until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing up in Sweden, Brack's career goal was to reach Formula  
One. 
</P>
<P>
	His apprenticeship was spent in road racing and his future  
seemed assured in the mid-90s when he was hired as a Formula One 
test driver, first by Williams and then Arrows. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he suddenly popped up in this country, driving Indy cars  
for Rick Galles, first in CART and then in the rival IRL. 
</P>
<P>
	His first Indy 500 was in 1997, sort of. He was caught up in a  
crash on the warmup lap, finishing 33rd without ever taking the 
green flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least that gave me some experience,'' Brack said with a  
shrug. ``Last year, when I drove for A.J. was really the first time 
I ran in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In that one, he finished sixth and might have had a shot at  
winning had not the team miscalculated fuel mileage early in the 
race, running him dry and costing him a lap he never made up. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Brack won after Gordon ran out of fuel.  
</P>
<P>
	Foyt has been around racing long enough to know that luck comes  
and goes without warning. But he also knows it's essential to have 
a good driver who can take advantage of the breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody laughed at me when I hired him,'' Foyt said. ``I  
knew he could drive a race car. Now everybody knows it.''

<HEADLINE> Creatine May Not Be Good As Thought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The supplement creatine is not the muscle  
builder and performance booster that many athletes believe it is, 
the chairman of a panel of experts has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The expectations for creatine far outweigh the returns,'' said  
Ron Terjung, a professor of physiology at the University of 
Missouri, Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Terjung chaired a roundtable on creatine supplementation at the  
American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis. The 
roundtable's opinions will be shared at the sports medicine 
organization's annual meeting June 5 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one critic, a supporter of creatine, plans to be on  
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have found performance improvements in laboratory  
tests involving sudden bursts of very strenuous activity, Terjung 
said. But the improvements are under specific conditions, and they 
don't match up with what most athletes do, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, in the third through sixth repetition of a brief  
but very intense workout on a stationary bike, performance might 
improve 2 percent or 3 percent, Terjung said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Others would say that's the distinction between a gold medal  
or not, but the circumstances don't match the sport task,'' he 
said. What's more, so many other things can affect sports 
performance that it would be hard to weed out the effects of the 
creatine on competition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatine-using athletes don't seem to realize this, Terjung  
said. There are many reports of athletes who believe creatine makes 
them stronger or faster, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatine supplements work by helping the body replenish  
adenosine triphosphate, known as ATP, which is a key source of 
energy for muscle. The body makes creatine, but creatine also can 
be found in protein-rich foods as well as in over-the-counter 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	When the body reaches a maximum and muscles are saturated with  
creatine, the balance is excreted in the urine. As a result, more 
is not necessarily better, and users who try to supersaturate with 
massive doses will fail, Terjung said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the muscles have what they can handle, only about 3 more  
grams a day are needed to maintain this level, he said. ``The 
modest few grams will certainly suffice,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is still out on creatine's value as a training aid,  
Terjung said. The supplement clearly makes athletes bigger, but 
this seems largely to be because creatine makes them retain water, 
he said. It's not certain if creatine builds lasting strength or 
endurance improvements, or whether the performance changes that 
result from creatine linger after creatine use ends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, some training rooms are becoming more cautious  
about supplying the supplement, although others still provide it 
freely to athletes, said Dr. Mark S. Juhn of the University of 
Washington. Schools that are cutting back may also be concerned 
about possible side effects and the resulting potential for legal 
action, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes who have taken creatine have reported such problems as  
cramping and diarrhea, although the problems end after creatine use 
is stopped. On the other hand, any severe long-term effects that 
creatine could have on the body aren't known yet, said Juhn, who 
wrote a review article in a medical journal, The Physician and 
Sportsmedicine. Juhn noted two case reports of kidney problems, 
including one March 19 in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 
cases responded to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Juhn overstates the risk, countered researcher Richard B.  
Kreider of the University of Memphis. He and Steven S. Plisk of 
Yale wrote a largely supportive review in the Strength and 
Conditioning Journal of the National Strength and Conditioning 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our view is that creatine appears to be safe and effective,''  
he said. The reports of cramping are not out of the ordinary, 
considering that athletes normally have some cramping as they 
train, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two clinical reports don't make a case for risk because they  
can't rule out some other cause for the condition, he said, adding 
that several studies have found no kidney risk. 
</P>
<P>
	And creatine clearly works, said Juhn, who plans to attend the  
ACSM's Seattle seminar. Creatine helps athletes gain muscle, and 
the gains are too big to be explained simply by water retention, 
Juhn's article said. What's more, creatine's gains come without 
adding body fat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creatine's critics also understate the supplement's benefits,  
Juhn said. If it improves performance in a lab test, then creatine 
should help performance on the field, he said. Lab tests are done 
because it's scientifically too difficult to test the supplement 
under game conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Juhn and Plisk caution athletes who take creatine to be  
sure they are getting the real stuff. ``The market is being flooded 
with low-quality product of overseas origin and possibly with 
domestic product that is being cut by unscrupulous distributors 
(often accompanied by a bogus/photocopied certificate of analysis 
or none at all),'' their article said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers should make sure their dealer and the manufacturer have  
solid reputations, it said.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Spreading in Dry Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Fla. (AP) -- Weary firefighters using tanker helicopters  
and planes struggled against a huge fire in the Okefenokee Swamp of 
northern Florida and southern Georgia today. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot, dry weather could cause the fire to spread further.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a war zone,'' said Bill Paxton, a spokesman for  
the firefighting operation. ``We've got helicopters and tanker 
planes sweeping in for runs over the fire. We've got dozens of 
bulldozers and fire engines going and coming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some real close calls -- fire crews barely making it  
over burning bridges that are the only way in and out of areas. 
Then there's the snakes. Again, some close calls. No one bitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire had burned 53,000 acres by Monday night. It was  
believed to have been started by lightning May 21. The swamp is 
surrounded by fire lines from previous years, and no homes were 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread a fire over  
11,000 acres between the Arizona-Utah line and Grand Canyon 
National Park. Another lightning wildfire 80 miles west of Phoenix 
burned 14,600 acres but was contained by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in Nevada called in reinforcements to help battle a  
blaze that had charred 7,000 acres in rugged terrain about 85 miles 
northeast of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's Joshua Tree National Park, a 13,900-acre  
wildfire was contained as crews started work on restoring the 
fragile desert habitat blackened by the blaze, which also was 
started by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 400 firefighters were involved in the Florida-Georgia  
fire, and volunteer crews and equipment had come in from 30 states, 
including Alaska.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Rookie Knows Big Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	From Little League to NHL, Chris Drury just keeps on winning.  
</P>
<P>
	Ten years after he pitched Trumbull, Conn., to the Little League  
World Series title, Drury has helped put the Colorado Avalanche 
within one victory of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	With game-winning goals in Colorado's last two wins and four in  
the playoffs, Drury has tied a rookie record set by teammate Claude 
Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't thought about it,'' he said after the Avalanche  
skated on Monday. ``I don't look at it as a personal thing. We just 
won a couple of big games and now we have another big game coming 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drury scored the overtime goal against Dallas that tied this  
semifinal series at 2-2 and then connected twice, including another 
game-winner, as the Avalanche won Game 5. Now, Colorado can finish 
off the Stars on Tuesday night at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to go for the next step,'' Drury said. ``We're home  
and we don't want to go back there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this hero stuff is nothing new to Drury. The spotlight  
hit him a decade ago in the 1989 Little League World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember it like it was yesterday,'' Drury said. ``It was a  
big thrill, a lot of fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan had won three straight Little League titles when the kids  
from Trumbull ended that run on a five-hitter by Drury, who also 
drove in two runs in the clinching victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were never nervous or scared,'' he said. ``We got on a roll  
and the next thing we knew, we were on television, playing in front 
of a crowd of 40,000. I'm still in touch with two or three of those 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drury played college hockey at Boston University, where he set  
the school scoring record. He led BU to an NCAA championship and 
won the Hobey Baker Aaward -- college hockey's Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	He was drafted in the second round in 1994 and showed up in  
training camp last September as an undersized center who could play 
all three forward spots. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5-foot-10 and 180 pounds, he was viewed as small -- by  
everybody except himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am who I am,'' he said. ``There are some big guys in this  
league and it's an adjustment, but I've managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He had 20 goals and 24 assists in his rookie season, with nine  
of his goals tying or winning games. He is a finalist for the 
Calder Trophy as Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	And about that size thing. Well, when Drury pitched Trumbull  
past Taiwan, he was 5-foot-1 1/2 and 126 pounds. It didn't stop him 
then and it's not exactly stopping him now.

<HEADLINE> Providence Plays Last Baseball Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The end inevitably came with hugs,  
tears and a long ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Providence baseball program played its last game Sunday at  
the NCAA Tallahassee regional, but not before the Friars put up one 
memorable last stand. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing by six runs and facing extinction, the Friars fought  
back to reach the championship round by beating Jacksonville 9-8 in 
10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though that earned the Friars only a few hours' reprieve --  
Florida State eliminated Providence 14-3 in a later game to win the 
regional -- the extra-inning comeback will stand as their lasting 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys have brought that kind of intensity to the ballpark  
every day,'' Providence coach Charlie Hickey said. ``Even if we had 
lost, it would have been one to hang the hat on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	School officials decided last October to discontinue baseball  
after this season, joining men's golf and men's tennis on the 
chopping block in an attempt to meet gender equity requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came despite the baseball team earning two previous  
berths in the NCAA tournament and recording just one losing season 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The team's response was to put together the most successful  
season in school history, winning 43 games in the regular season 
and four more to take the Big East tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Providence came to Tallahassee as the No. 2 seed behind host  
Florida State, then lost to Jacksonville in the tournament opener. 
The Friars earned a rematch by beating The Citadel, but things 
looked bleak when they trailed 7-1 after 5 1/2 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the Friars really expressed how much they didn't  
want to stop playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	With their teammates passionately shouting encouragement from  
the top row of the dugout for the final five innings, the Friars 
poured their hearts into the performance. 
</P>
<P>
	They rallied to tie the game 7-7, fell behind when Jacksonville  
scored in the top of the ninth, then tied it again to send the game 
to extra innings. Finally in the 10th, Neal McCarthy hit a two-out 
solo homer to keep the Friars alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a lot of fun,'' Hickey said. ``I said coming into this  
tournament that we were going to be a tough team to beat. Those 
last three or four innings, we just kept coming and coming and 
coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the kind of game the Friars had made a habit of playing  
this spring, as if something very precious to them was being taken 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just never gave up,'' third baseman Angelo Ciminiello said.  
``It's just the kind of team we are. We play every inning, every 
pitch. We're an emotional team and we just stuck together. Good 
things happen when you stay up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point actually came midway through the seventh  
inning, when the umpires tossed Providence backup catcher Jeremy 
Sweet and Jacksonville third baseman Kirk Asche for verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweet was yelling obscenities from the dugout and Asche  
responded from his third-base position. The incident only added 
fuel to the Friars' comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could feel it,'' Hickey said. ``We were just going to scrap  
and scrap and scrap. If the umpire had thrown out 24 of us, we 
would have continued to scrap out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Friars didn't have enough left to challenge Florida  
State, a program that has reached the College World Series in five 
of the past seven years. The Seminoles broke a 2-2 tie with three 
runs in the third inning and gradually pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth inning, Florida State's fans gave Providence a long  
standing ovation. After the final out, the Friars hugged and shed 
tears in front of their dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had to feel for them,'' FSU catcher Jeremiah Klosterman  
said. ``Even when they trailed us by 10 runs, you could see them 
digging down deep and believing they could still win. You have to 
respect that. I just hope they reinstate their program again 
someday.''

<HEADLINE> Higher Interest Rates May Be on Way / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At their present pace of spending and borrowing,  
Americans will surely get a dose of what they don't want, which is 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	That isn't to say they will maintain the present pace, but if  
they do the excess of demand over supply eventually will show up in 
prices, setting off a clanging alarm in Federal Reserve offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing a clear indication of what could occur, Fed  
policy-makers recently indicated that they were leaning toward a 
move to raise rates if supply didn't more evenly match demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other effects, higher short-term rates would mean added  
costs to corporations, which have been able to hold the price line 
by raising productivity and cutting prices. 
</P>
<P>
	With their money costs raised, and unable to cut costs in other  
areas, companies would be inclined to raise prices. That is, unless 
consumer demand lessened, and consumers lowered their level of 
borrowing, reduced their debts and began saving. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrowing and spending as a percentage of income have been near  
record highs over the past year, and the savings rate has fallen to 
its lowest since records were begun. It has been less than zero for 
five of the past six months, a feat made possible by easy credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing markets and prices too have been near all-time highs,  
month after month surprising analysts who say a downturn is likely. 
And automobile sales too. And recreation and travel as well. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't likely to continue, unless as they say in the stock  
market, we've entered a new era, this one being an era of unlimited 
funds for unlimited demands for limitless material desires. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the economy needs a rest, and if consumers won't  
provide it then higher interest rates will. Higher rates inevitably 
work their way through the economy, raising costs and slow 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Housing's fate, usually a precursor of things to come, provides  
an excellent example since it leads to so many other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Home Builders estimates that  
construction of 1,000 single-family homes generates 2,448 jobs, 
$79.4 million in wages and $42.5 million in tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	This spending helps finance thousands of companies in hundreds  
of industries: lumber, paints, masonry, glass, steel, copper, 
aluminum, asphalt, slate, drywall, tile, mortar, plastics, etc. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending doesn't stop there. The NAHB study indicates that a  
new homebuyer in the first year after purchase spends $2,475 on 
property alterations, $2,177 on furnishings and $529 on appliances. 
</P>
<P>
	Raise mortgage rates just slightly and otherwise make borrowing  
a bit tougher and you'll have thrown a pebble into the local 
economic pond. Multiply by a thousand and the ripples cross oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	For a forecast of things to come, therefore, it would be  
instructive to look at housing's statistics. If the pace slows, 
maybe there won't be higher rates. If not, then watch the Fed.

<HEADLINE> Temps May Not Stay Temps for Long </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MindSpring Enterprises, a fast-growing Internet provider,  
increasingly relies on a temp agency to supply a stream of workers 
for its call-in centers. But the company is careful to offer them 
staff jobs, or replace them after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a growing number of companies, Atlanta-based MindSpring  
uses temporary workers to cut costs and solve labor shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	But temporary workers are increasingly demanding employee  
benefits if they work as long and hard as permanent workers, 
compelling wary businesses like MindSpring to take steps so temps 
don't become de facto employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A closely watched court battle between Microsoft Corp. and its  
longtime temps -- dubbed ``permatemps'' -- is the most visible sign 
of this growing workplace issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest twist to the case, a U.S. appeals court panel  
ruled in mid-May that thousands of former temps should have been 
allowed to join the company's lucrative stock-purchase program. 
Last Wednesday, Microsoft asked the full appeals court to review 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was the first to hold that temps can look to both  
their agency and their work-site employer for benefits. It raises 
the specter that employers will be liable for everything from 
temps' benefits to their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It's) is another reminder ... that they just can't change the  
label or badge and turn them into a non-employee,'' said Catherine 
Ruckelshaus, litigation director at the National Employment Law 
Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1982, the percentage of temps has quadrupled to 2.2  
percent of all workers, according to forthcoming data from the 
Economic Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. On 
any given day, about 1.3 million temps are at work, spawning an 
estimated $60 billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 90 percent of U.S. companies use temps, often because they  
provide a flexible, quick and cheaper source of labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Temps, who are mostly women, are clustered in low-paying work,  
such as secretarial jobs and most would prefer a permanent job. Few 
get health insurance or other benefits from their agencies, 
according to Economic Policy Institute studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft temps have filed a number of lawsuits against the  
company. Along with the suit seeking stock-purchase rights, the 
temps are suing for health insurance and pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach responds that temp agency  
employees look to their agencies for wages and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear that Microsoft employees work for Microsoft  
and employees of temp agencies work for temp agencies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But many employers aren't so sure that the lines of  
responsibility are clear anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some courts have defined a ``common-law employee'' as a worker  
who's spent more than five months at a company, substantially under 
the employers' control. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get calls regularly on this issue, asking `How do we make  
this determination,''' said Michael Bartlett, manager of labor law 
policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``There are serious 
liability concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, companies are tightening contracts to more clearly  
exclude temps from benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have established internal ``temp agencies'' that assign  
roving permanent workers to different projects. Others have leased 
some of their operations to outside firms rather than bringing in 
temps. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring, the Internet provider, reluctantly began using temps  
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so antithetical to our philosophy of how a good company  
operates,'' said vice president Carter Calle, explaining that 
MindSpring wants to rely on permanent employees who have a stake in 
the company due to stock options and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Now MindSpring uses a staffing agency to recruit, screen and  
hire temps, then -- to prevent ``permatemping'' -- makes sure they're 
either hired or let go after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Temp agencies, as well, should do more for their workers,  
advocacy groups say. A coalition of such groups, including the 
national working women's group 9 to 5, will unveil a national code 
of conduct for temp agencies in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to raise the bar, and improve practices through  
voluntary action,'' said Ellen Bravo, co-director of 9 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the coalition is helping a community group  
monitor the industry, with plans to publicize model temp agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a strategy applauded by Kamal Larsuel, a 29-year-old  
engineer who's been working as a Microsoft temp for 16 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft needs to put their foot down and say, `If you want  
to be a preferred agency with Microsoft, you need to provide us 
with better benefits,'' she suggested. ``That would be the smart 
thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Burying Dead In Spite and In Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like books in a library, each with a name for  
a title, each with a story to tell, the graves at Arlington 
National Cemetery sweep down the green hills to a broad river in a 
place where a nation honors its own. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first volume, the one that explains the presence of the  
rest, could be titled ``Revenge,'' a story of soldiers from one 
side of a civil war buried deliberately at the dooryard of the 
other side's commanding general. 
</P>
<P>
	They were buried, these Union soldiers, out of necessity but  
also out of spite. Their graves guaranteed that Confederate Gen. 
Robert E. Lee would never again occupy Arlington House, his wife's 
pillared Virginia mansion with its spectacular view of Washington 
across the Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
	The story lost its sting long ago when Confederate dead joined  
their Union foes at rest, when the place became the grounds on 
which Americans of all wars were interred, honored and 
commemorated. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, on 612 acres, there are more than 250,000 war dead,  
veterans and their dependents. Their ranks include presidents and 
privates. More than 4 million people visit each year. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the beginning there was the columned plantation house  
where George Washington Parke Custis, the adopted son of the 
nation's first president, had installed every piece of Washington 
memorabilia he could find: portraits, captured battle flags, the 
general's Yorktown tent, his clothes, his umbrellas, his death bed. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1830, Custis' daughter, Anna, married Robert E. Lee. They  
were living at Arlington House in 1861 when Lee, then a lieutenant 
colonel, declined Abraham Lincoln's offer to command the Union army 
and cast his lot instead with the Confederacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington House was quickly occupied. Looting followed. The  
remaining Washington relics were packed and labeled, ``Captured at 
Arlington.'' Many are now at the Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, battles had been fought near Washington, creating an  
urgent need for burial space. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, quartermaster general of the  
U.S. Army, a man who had developed an acid hatred of the South, 
ordered the immediate seizure of the house and grounds for a 
military cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear that Meigs' intention was to bury soldiers in the  
immediate proximity to Arlington House, rendering the mansion 
uninhabitable should the Lee family ever attempt to return,'' James 
Edward Peters wrote in the detailed 1986 guide, ``Arlington 
National Cemetery, Shrine to America's Heroes,'' published by 
Woodbine House. 
</P>
<P>
	The burials began immediately around Mrs. Lee's rose garden. In  
1866, Meigs ordered a vault for 2,111 unidentified soldiers whose 
remains had been found near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lees never returned, but Meigs stayed on. He is buried a  
short stroll from the House next to a son, shot dead near the end 
of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	His name is now just one on a long roll call: Justice Oliver  
Wendell Holmes; presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan; 
polar explorer Richard Byrd; President Taft; Daniel ``Chappie'' 
James Jr., the first black four-star general; Joe Louis, the boxer; 
Gen. John J. Pershing, the World War I commander; Samuel Dashiell 
Hammett, the detective novelist who created Sam Spade. 
</P>
<P>
	At night, the flame above President Kennedy's grave winks and  
flickers on the slope below Arlington House. ``I could stay here 
forever,'' he said during a visit in 1963, the year of his 
assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlington has been indelible in the national mind since 1921  
when the government interred the Unknown Soldier from World War I 
``in honored glory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirke Simpson, an Associated Press correspondent, wrote a  
Pulitzer Prize-winning story that began: ``Under the wide and 
starry skies of his own home-land America's unknown dead from 
France sleeps tonight, a soldier home from the wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then soldiers who lost their names as well as their lives  
have been chosen to represent the dead of World War II, Korea, 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing technology enabled the positive identification of the  
serviceman selected to represent Vietnam veterans. Last year the 
remains of Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie were disinterred 
and transferred to his family, unknown no more. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, members of a House committee complained loudly that  
the cemetery needs roadwork, that water damage in the chapel of the 
memorial amphitheater is unrepaired, that sidewalks are buckling 
and flagstones are breaking. ``We need some help,'' said Arlington 
Superintendent John C. Metzler Jr., pleading for more money for 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	Most visitors, however, will see only well-tended, quiet beauty.  
</P>
<P>
	Although space is increasingly restricted, more than 5,000  
people are interred at Arlington each year. 
</P>
<P>
	And still come echoes of the scene Kirke Simpson witnessed when  
the Unknown Soldier from World War I was interred. 
</P>
<P>
	``A rocking blast of gunfire rang from the woods. The glittering  
circle of bayonets stiffened to a salute to the dead. Again the 
guns shouted their message of honor and farewell. Again they boomed 
out; a loyal comrade was being laid to his last, long rest.''

<HEADLINE> Students To Return to Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Counselors will be on hand this week as  
Columbine High School students return there for the first time 
since the shootings to finally retrieve their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	One substitute teacher left her purse. Other teachers and  
students left backpacks and books as they fled in panic when two 
students opened fire and began hurling bombs April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Kaufman, spokesman for Jefferson County Public Schools,  
said students have been assigned specific times to pick up their 
belongings Tuesday and will be escorted in groups of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Some areas remain off-limits. Except for some items being held  
as evidence, belongings that were left in the commons area outside 
the cafeteria, where the attack began, or the library, where most 
of the deaths occurred, will be picked up in the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The library is still considered a crime scene,'' Kaufman said.  
</P>
<P>
	The return is expected to be so emotional that counselors will  
be available, and parents have been invited, said school 
spokeswoman Marilyn Saltzman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids are really anxious to get their belongings,'' Saltzman  
said. ``They have purses, glasses, credit cards and keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a  
teacher and wounded 21 more before taking their lives. Columbine 
students finished out the school year at nearby Chatfield High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	The district will spend the summer renovating the rooms damaged  
by bombs, bullets and water. 
</P>
<P>
	Emily Stepp and her brother Brian are among those who will be  
returning to pick up their things. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard because that was my last day in there as  
a senior,'' Ms. Stepp said. ``Most kids' last day in their school 
is happy.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally mixed  
Monday, with prices rising in Tokyo and Hong Kong but slumping in 
Taipei and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
138.97 points, or 0.87 percent, to close at 16,111.65. On Friday, 
the average shed 204.51 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Market sentiment in Tokyo was boosted by a rise in U.S. shares  
on Friday and the dollar's climb against the yen in Asian trading 
on Monday. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.81 
points to close Friday at 10,559.74. 
</P>
<P>
	However, trading was light as many investors abstained from  
taking positions due to market holidays Monday in the United States 
and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Many market players also held back as they mulled over whether  
Japan is likely to draw up a new budget to pay for additional 
economic stimulus measures, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar was quoted at 121.36 yen in late afternoon  
trading, up 0.84 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late 
New York level of 121.43 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed higher after two  
straight sessions of sharp declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 87.87 points, or 0.7 percent, closing at 
12,147.12. On Friday, the index had slumped 249.28 points, or 2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices were pushed up by a bout of  
bargain-hunting late in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	But shares of Cathay Pacific Airways slumped because of a pay  
dispute between the airline and its pilots that caused many flights 
to be canceled. Cathay's shares fell 1.15 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
14 cents) to 10.65 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. $1.30). 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, share prices closed sharply lower in the absence of  
market-boosting news. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's main Weighted Stock Price Index fell 103.13  
points, or 1.38 percent, to 7,316.57. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand share prices also closed sharply lower, with brokers  
attributing the slide to a bout of heavy overseas selling in local 
blue-chip stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 52.81 points, or 2.5  
percent, to 2,061.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was closed in Thailand for a public holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: The Philippine stock index closed higher, boosted by the  
favorable first quarter economic data released Friday and a 
recovery on Wall Street. The 30-company Philippine Stock Exchange 
Index (PSE Index) rose 27.55 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,419.83. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher, with a sharp rise  
in banking stocks countering a fall in the resources sector to see 
the broader market push up into positive territory. The All 
Ordinaries Index rose 11.6 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,900.2. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock  
Price Index rose 3.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 736.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed little changed. The Straits Times  
Index edged up 0.18 point to 1,903.86. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on  
profit-taking despite the release of favorable trade data for 
April. The benchmark Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip 
stocks, fell 5.99 points, or 0.7 percent, to 743.04. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed mixed, but continued buying in

<HEADLINE> Casting Stones on China Spy Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To make a political issue of Chinese nuclear  
spying, Republicans have to pleaded ignorance, because GOP 
administrations were in charge for 12 of the 20 years when weapons 
secrets are said to have been leaking. 
</P>
<P>
	That's producing an odd debate.  
</P>
<P>
	Presidents are supposed to supervise national security and  
intelligence gathering, so in contending that the current 
administration is culpable but theirs weren't, Republicans are 
admitting that their people didn't do the job right either. 
</P>
<P>
	There is ample evidence of blundering by this White House. It's  
worse because of blurred White House accounts of who knew what 
when, of what President Clinton was told, at what time, and why 
there wasn't instant action. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's instinct for the evasive answer is part of his problem  
now. He said 2 1/2 months ago that he was not aware of any espionage 
by China against U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories ``during my 
presidency.'' In defense of that statement, Clinton allies now say 
that nobody has been convicted of spying. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration had reports of alleged espionage as early  
as 1995, and Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, has 
said he briefed the president on the problem in July 1997; he'd 
earlier said it wasn't until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a directive for stronger security and  
counterintelligence measures at the nuclear weapons labs in 
February 1998. And whatever the timing of Clinton briefings, the 
House report that China has been stealing nuclear secrets was 
delivered to the administration on Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
	All of that invites suspicions and Republican accusations of lax  
security or worse, suggesting, without really saying, that the mess 
may have something to do with illegal Chinese contributions to the 
Democrats for the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign. The House 
report said Chinese agents ``may have used these contributions to 
gain access to U.S. military and commercial technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the select committee  
that investigated Chinese spying, said it has worsened on Clinton's 
watch. ``If you take a look at the quality and quantity of thefts 
that have occurred of late, this is an espionage effort that has 
accelerated over the last several years,'' he said in a TV 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The report from Cox's committee was unanimous and bipartisan,  
but the mood didn't last. While both Democrats and Republicans are 
saying that the task now is to fix what's wrong and protect what 
secrets haven't been lost, the blame argument comes first. Sen. 
Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader, said there should be no 
rush to judgment -- and that heads should roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty House Republicans joined by one maverick Democrat have  
sent Clinton a letter calling for the resignation of Berger on 
grounds he misled Congress and the nation as to when he was told of 
Chinese espionage and when he told the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Richard  
Shelby, R-Ala., wants Attorney General Janet Reno to resign for 
mishandling the legal side of the spy case. She said she won't, but 
acknowledged delays in the case, and said she was not informed of a 
dispute that prevented FBI wiretapping of an alleged spy two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican candidates for president in 2000 quickly seized on  
the spy issue, Texas Gov. George W. Bush breaking his relative 
silence to say that he'd have acted immediately as president. He 
said Clinton didn't, and then tried to minimize the seriousness of 
the breach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate that China has been stealing secrets during  
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton,'' he said. ``But there is only 
one administration that has been given the news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration knew more and still chose not to take  
action,'' said Elizabeth Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, vice president in the administration of Bush's  
father, said they would have dealt with the spying had they known. 
``The real political scandal is the fact that there was evidence of 
this and the first response of the administration was simply to 
ignore it, to cover it up,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He sidestepped the question of whether the Bush administration  
should have known. ``The fact is we didn't, and I can't go back 
eight, or seven years as to why we didn't, but we didn't,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were warning signals in those Republican years. A  
Defense Intelligence Agency report in 1984 reported Chinese nuclear 
spying even then. It was released last week by the private National 
Security Archive. During the Bush administration, the General 
Accounting Office reported that ineffective security made the 
weapons labs vulnerable to espionage. An Energy Department official 
says he tried to alert the Senate Intelligence Committee to alleged 
spying in 1994 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The House report suggests that the problem may have started as a  
Cold War leftover, because U.S. intelligence was so focused on the 
old Soviet Union that China wasn't a priority. That has changed in 
the past few years, the committee report said, but U.S. authorities 
still lack the resources or the linguists needed for the task.

<HEADLINE> Actor Mathison Happy on Daytime TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERMUDA RUN, N.C. (AP) -- Cameron Mathison has some reassuring  
words for fans of his character Ryan Lavery on ``All My Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to move into prime time and films,'' he said.  
``That's a long-term goal for me. However, I consider myself very 
lucky to be working as an actor and on `All My Children.' If I had 
a long career in daytime, I would consider myself very lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathison was in town to play in a golf tournament that also  
attracted actor M. Emmett Walsh, figure skater Scott Hamilton and 
``Entertainment Tonight'' co-host Bob Goen. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathison said he hadn't expected to fulfill his dream of  
becoming an actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come from a professional family,'' he said. ``Being an actor  
wasn't in the cards. But I would go to the movies and think, 'I 
could do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months after his first audition, he landed the role on  
``All My Children.''

<HEADLINE> Car-Hauler Talks Extended 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiators for the Teamsters union and  
companies that haul new cars to auto showrooms are resuming 
contract talks after averting a strike early today that could have 
meant long delays in the delivery of some models. 
</P>
<P>
	Union President James P. Hoffa told reporters following a  
post-midnight bargaining session that the 12:01 a.m. EDT strike 
deadline was being extended for 24 hours to discuss management's 
``11th hour'' economic proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were to resume this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	While company officials declined to comment on their new offer,  
Hoffa said, ``We have some movement by the employer, but there 
still are troubling issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said the main sticking points with the 17 affected  
companies were management proposals to pay a lower wage to newly 
hired drivers and to hire part-time workers. Hoffa told reporters 
the union still was willing to strike over both of those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said, however, that management made ``an important move''  
by dropping a demand to use Mexican drivers and trucks to deliver 
vehicles in the United States after the U.S.-Mexican border opens 
up Jan. 1 under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Company 
officials had said earlier Monday that they had no plans to hire 
Mexican truckers and contended this was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, in addition to seeking wage and benefit improvements,  
wants higher retirement pay for drivers who choose to retire after 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations represented the first major challenge at the  
bargaining table for Hoffa, sworn in March 22 as president of the 
union once led by his late father, Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike by the drivers who haul cars from factories to  
showrooms could mean longer waits for popular cars, union officials 
have said. Automakers also have worried that if a strike persisted 
beyond several days they would not have space to keep vehicles as 
they come off the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne, spokesman for the management negotiators of the  
National Automobile Transporters labor division, said the 17 
companies hauled more than 15 million cars last year, but that the 
companies faced stiff competition from railroads and nonunion 
trucking companies. The union has cited ``record profits'' by the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics, yard and  
office workers. Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a year in 
wages and benefits, with salaries of $55,000. The Teamsters said 
management wanted to pay newly hired drivers 30 percent less than 
the contract wage, with gradual increases eventually equalizing the 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that Hoffa has been a factor in the  
discussions. He was elected in December in the aftermath of a 
campaign finance scandal, and personally led the union negotiating 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important set of talks for Hoffa,'' said Chip  
Roth, the union spokesman. ``He'll be judged on his ability to 
deliver for the members. He knows the members will be watching 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said he felt ``invigorated'' by leading the bargaining  
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief management negotiator, said Hoffa's personal  
stake in the talks ``can't be discounted as a factor. ... Sure, it 
is a political concern that he has. But we're attempting at the 
table to reduce that as a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
Inc., said a strike would have an impact within days. ``Some plants 
could be affected in a day or two because they'd run out of room to 
park vehicles that are coming off the assembly line,'' Healy said. 
He added that dealers' inventories overall are ``normal to slightly 
below normal.'' Roth, the union spokesman, said a strike would mean 
``people would have to wait for the hottest-selling cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Adler of General Motors Corp. said that GM had  
``contingency plans'' but he did not elaborate. He said that during 
a car-haulers strike in 1995, the company allowed dealers to pick 
up cars from factories.

	China Tries To Disprove Charges  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's government took reporters on a tour of  
the Internet today to show that data about America's nuclear 
arsenal is freely available. Zhao Qizheng, the government's top 
spokesman, said the power, weight, dimensions and other details of 
the seven types of U.S. nuclear weapons China was alleged to have 
stolen were openly published in the United States. More data, 
including information on the most sophisticated U.S. warhead, the 
W-88, ``can easily be found on the Internet,'' Zhao said. ``They 
are no longer secrets, so there is nothing to steal.'' A U.S. 
congressional committee on Chinese espionage concluded that China 
stole secrets about the major warheads in the U.S. nuclear arsenal 
over 20 years.

<HEADLINE> Crossing Legs: Bad for Your Health? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mama may say it's the right thing to do, but  
forget good manners and uncross those legs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting like a proper lady or gentleman interrupts the flow of  
blood to the heart and may promote varicose veins, according to one 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
	One in four adults has vein problems, although women are four to  
10 times more likely to develop them, said Dr. Luis Navarro, a 
surgeon who runs the Vein Treatment Center at Beth Israel Medical 
Center in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Varicose veins are twisted and enlarged veins that are typically  
close to the surface of the skin but can affect deeper blood 
vessels as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crossing the legs is like second nature for most women and  
some men, too,'' Navarro said. ``It's a bad habit and one of the 
first things you should learn to undo if you suffer from varicose 
veins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Crossing the legs slows the upward flow of blood and  
increases pressure inside the veins, Navarro explained. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't matter if you cross at the knee or the ankles,  
Navarro said. Both are bad, although he said knee-crossing puts 
more stress on the venous system. 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Kaplan, 23, who sat reading, cross-legged, recently at  
Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, said she had ``no idea there was 
any connection'' between the way she sat and a possible health 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truthfully, I wasn't even aware I was doing it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's more comfortable, but a woman who crosses her leg also  
looks more like a lady,'' said Liza Sholl, 29, who munched her 
lunch nearby, her legs properly crossed. 
</P>
<P>
	Navarro said half of women over age 40 suffer from varicose  
veins or spider veins, which are less serious breaks in smaller, 
surface veins. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause is unknown, but genetics is a key factor. ``Sixty to  
80 percent of people who have varicose or spider veins have a 
history on their mother's side,'' Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, valves in the blood vessels help prevent blood from  
flowing backward. But for women, changes during pregnancy and the 
effects of high-estrogen birth control pills can reduce the valves' 
ability to close, allowing blood to pool in the vessels and the 
veins to become varicose. 
</P>
<P>
	Diet, obesity, age and a sedentary lifestyle also can  
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Advanced cases are treated with surgery but for many, simple  
lifestyle changes can keep other varicose or spider veins from 
developing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Exercise is the first and most important thing to do,''  
Navarro said. People who sit eight hours a day with their legs 
crossed will have a greater chance of developing varicose veins if 
there is a genetic factor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you have varicose veins, the body can't cure them,''  
Navarro said, ``but following these simple things (exercise etc.) 
can help keep your legs healthier five, 10, 15 years down the 
road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some tips on how to keep leg veins strong and healthy:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Exercise. Walk, walk, walk.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Don't sit for long periods of time. Take small, walking  
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rotate the ankles and flex the toes while sitting.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Eat a high-fiber diet to avoid constipation.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Elevate legs six to 12 inches above the heart while sleeping.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Try to maintain an ideal weight.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Wear mild compression stockings if your job (as a cashier, for  
example) requires you to stand in one place with little movement 
all day.

	LARES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Rescuers on Monday pulled out 17 cave  
enthusiasts who were trapped overnight in a Puerto Rican cavern 
when an underground river sealed off their exit and swept away one 
of their guides. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was touring a cave in western Lares, about 50 miles  
west of San Juan, when heavy rains began at about 3 p.m., swelling 
a subterranean river. 
</P>
<P>
	One of their guides, Francis Reyes, tried to cross the river  
with a member of the group, but was dragged deeper into the cave by 
the current, police said. His body was found Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The caver he had tried to help, Elba Vazquez Gonzalez, was  
thrown against rocks and suffered a head injury. She was in stable 
condition Monday at a hospital in nearby Arecibo. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other women made it across unhurt and walked to nearby homes  
for help.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori said Monday that  
Peru had relaunched the sale of its vast Camisea natural gas fields 
in the Amazon jungle, 10 months after oil giants Shell had Mobil 
pulled out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Fujimori has called the $2.4 billion Camisea development the  
``project of the century'' for Peru that would power this poor 
South American nation's economic growth into the 21st century. 
Camisea is the largest natural gas field in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Dutch/Shell and Mobil Corp. pulled out of the project due  
to differences with the government over the sale and marketing of 
the gas. Industry analysts said that rising projected costs and a 
lack of secure markets for the gas had also taken some of the 
luster off the project. 
</P>
<P>
	Camisea is located 310 miles southeast of Lima amid some of the  
world's most biodiverse jungle and primitive Indian tribes. It has 
proven reserves of 13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Pledging an end to political  
infighting, San Juan Mayor Sila Calderon become president of her 
Popular Democratic Party Monday, the first step in her campaign for 
Puerto Rican governor. 
</P>
<P>
	As party supporters cheered and waved the party's red-and-white  
flag, Calderon took her oath of office from outgoing president 
Anibal Acevedo Vila during a ceremony at the party's headquarters 
near San Juan's colonial district. 
</P>
<P>
	The act was a signal that the popular mayor is the party's only  
candidate to run against Gov. Pedro Rossello, who is expected to 
seek a third term in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In her acceptance speech, the 56-year-old mayor said the party  
must quickly heal differences between politicians vying for 
resident commissioner, Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate in the 
U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Puerto Ricans want to see us united,'' Calderon said. ``It is  
imperative that we leave behind the confrontations.''

	GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A mob beat and burned to death two men  
they accused of thievery in a village in northern Guatemala Monday, 
bringing the number of lynching victims nationwide to 19 so far in 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 residents of the village of Setul, 60 miles north of  
Guatemala City, captured the two men, aged 21 and 27, and beat them 
severely before burning them alive, said Angel Conte, director of 
the National Civil Police. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of villagers blocked police and human rights  
officials from entering the village while the lynching took place, 
Conte said. By the time officials made it into Setul, the charred 
bodies had been buried. 
</P>
<P>
	Another four men, who villagers claimed belonged to the same  
criminal gang, escaped. Residents are reportedly searching for 
those men in surrounding villages. 
</P>
<P>
	A 30-year-old man was lynched in the same area last week.  
</P>
<P>
	About 50 people were lynched in Guatemala in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	In a January report, the U.N. Verification Mission in Guatemala  
said mob justice threatens the rule of law, sometimes targets 
people known to be innocent and is often tolerated by local 
officials.

<HEADLINE> Key West Protects Its Chickens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- It may mean drumsticks or fricassee to  
you, but the chicken reigns supreme in Margaritaville. 
</P>
<P>
	A tourist train full of senior citizens drives by one such  
creature. ``There, folks, is the national bird of Key West -- the 
chicken,'' the guide announces. 
</P>
<P>
	After generations of living on the streets, the lowly chicken is  
protected by city ordinance and afforded much the same respect as 
pelicans or great blue herons. 
</P>
<P>
	But the longtime pecking order has some residents squawking.  
</P>
<P>
	``Naughty chickens of town, I call them,'' said the Rev. Debra  
Benedict, who conducts wedding ceremonies for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have no natural enemies on this island. We need some  
hungry foxes,'' she said. ``The cats won't touch them. The chickens 
are meaner than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Benedict lives near a wild bird rescue center where the  
worst of the roost are relocated by bleary-eyed residents in the 
dead of night. It is often at such an hour that she bolts straight 
up in her bed to the sound of a rogue rooster crowing mistakenly at 
the moon or a street lamp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually went down so far as to get a copy of the ordinances  
relating to chicken harassment and realized my hands were tied,'' 
she said. ``It is a plague. Forget hornets. Forget locusts. Think 
chicken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The local law protecting chickens prohibits cruelty to animals  
and bans ``luring, enticing, seizing, molesting or teasing.'' The 
law requires that owners cage their fowl, but the wild ones roam 
the streets with abandon, enticing sympathetic residents to feed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody is anti-chicken.  
</P>
<P>
	At the Blue Heaven eatery, the birds fan out under and on top of  
tables. At night, they roost in the hedges, and boat sails are used 
to catch their droppings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the charm of Key West,'' said Sarah Clemens, a  
medical illustrator eating lunch. ``It's more laid back than where 
I live in West Palm Beach. The city would never allow chickens to 
roam like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Addleman, a code enforcement officer and a resident of Key  
West for 39 years, said the chickens are descendants of fighting 
roosters brought to the island by Cuban immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Conchs -- as the residents of Key West are called, in honor of  
the local shellfish -- devise ways to deal with the pesky birds and 
still stay out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since you can't throw rocks at them, people throw ice cubes  
because the evidence melts,'' said City Hall receptionist Claire 
Hurd, adding she, of course, would never do such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
	City commissioner Jimmy Weekley said the town has an ad hoc  
chicken relocation program that could get busy as spring folds into 
summer and the birds mate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way it works is somebody in the neighborhood catches one  
and takes it to somebody else's neighborhood,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baby chicks are everywhere. At the courthouse. At Blue Heaven.  
Crossing busy Duval Street behind mother hens. 
</P>
<P>
	``People love the little chicks,'' Ms. Benedict said. ``They  
don't realize they grow up into naughty chickens who will crow all 
night.''

<HEADLINE> Hundreds Mourn Ecuadorean Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- Using black and red felt-tip markers,  
friends of the four boys struck and killed by an Amtrak train wrote 
goodbyes on their light-colored caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 700 mourners crowded the Church of Jesus Christ of  
Latter-day Saints on Sunday at a wake for the boys and their 
mother, Julia Toledo de Urgiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services were scheduled today at the same Trumbull  
church. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were beautiful children, well-behaved,'' said Terry  
Asija, a native of Ecuador. She knew the Toledo family, who 
emigrated to Bridgeport from Ecuador 18 months ago, through the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Urgiles ``loved her children. They were very well cared  
for,'' said Asija. ``In one tragic moment, they're all gone. What 
more can I say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Urgiles, 47, will be buried in the same casket with her  
3-year-old son, Pedro. Jose, 10, and Angel, 6, also will share a 
casket. The oldest boy, Carlos, 11, will lie in his own casket. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was struck from behind Tuesday by an Amtrak train in  
Fairfield as they walked across a railroad trestle in the middle of 
the night. Mrs. Urgiles, Pedro, Angel and Carlos were killed 
instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose was declared brain-dead at Bridgeport Hospital two days  
after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, children left messages in both English and Spanish  
for the boys, saying ``I love you,'' or ``Te amo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Marquez, 9, a friend of Jose Toledo, wrote ``I will miss  
you a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A large arrangement of flowers with a white ribbon sash read  
``classmates'' in gold lettering. 
</P>
<P>
	A Drug and Alcohol Resistance Education, or DARE, T-shirt was  
signed by classmates and placed behind Carlos' casket. He was to 
receive a bronze DARE medallion this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral Director Edgar Rodriguez, of Funeraria Luz de Paz in  
Bridgeport, said arranging the funeral for a mother and her four 
young children has been an emotional task. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult, but I have to really put my feelings aside,''  
he said. ``My goal is to protect this family and help them grieve 
and help them heal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boys' father, Carlos Luis Urgiles, who arrived from Ecuador  
on Friday, did not attend the wake.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose today amid lackluster trading  
ahead of holidays in key overseas markets. The dollar climbed 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 138.97  
points, or 0.87 percent, to close at 16,111.65. On Friday, the 
average shed 204.51 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.36 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.84  
yen from late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 
121.43 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, trading was light as many investors  
abstained from taking positions due to market holidays today in the 
United States and Britain, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many market players also held back as they mulled over whether  
Japan is likely to draw up a new budget to pay for additional 
economic stimulus measures, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The outlook for the New York market, as well as events in  
Japan, such as the possible compilation of a supplementary budget, 
remains uncertain,'' said Masatoshi Sato, manager of investment 
information at Kankaku Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 375.53 million shares changed hands on the First  
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 416.77 million 
issues on Friday and the lowest level since Feb. 18. Advancers 
exceeded declining stocks 615 to 532, with 144 issues closing 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on  
the first section picked up 5.12 points, or 0.39 percent, to 
1,297.19. The TOPIX closed down 10.10 points, or 0.78 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and  
Telephone Corp. and its mobile unit, NTT Mobile Communications 
Network, were among the biggest gainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall market sentiment received a boost from a rise in U.S.  
shares on Friday and the dollar's climb against the yen in Asian 
trading today. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.81 points  
to close Friday at 10,559.74. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved slightly higher on  
short-covering as strength in the euro against the yen indirectly 
helped support the greenback in relation to the Japanese currency, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro's strength was based on speculation the European  
Central bank may finally move to prop up the euro by intervening in 
foreign exchange markets to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
	But so far the bank has taken no such action to try to stem the  
euro's steady decline since its January launch. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.4800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.4900 percent, 
driving its price up to 99.38 yen from 99.21 yen.

<HEADLINE> Amendment Proposes More Fed. Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to create nine new federal  
judgeships is headed for the House, but do not look for it soon to 
become law. 
</P>
<P>
	That is because the measure was slipped into a broader crime and  
gun control bill in the Senate by two powerful senators -- Orrin 
Hatch, R-Utah, and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. -- in an end run around a 
third powerful senator, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, who heads a subcommittee with jurisdiction over the  
issue, opposes creation of new judgeships until Congress can see 
whether any old slots should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Taken by surprise, Grassley pledged to have the provision  
stripped out when House and Senate negotiators meet. ``I raised 
Cain'' after finding out, he said in an interview off the Senate 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	However it eventually turns out, the episode is a classic Senate  
tale. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman and senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,  
Hatch and Leahy were sympathetic to the pleas of senators whose 
states appeared to have the heaviest judicial caseloads. Knowing of 
Grassley's certain opposition, the two negotiated privately. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, according to several sources who spoke on  
condition of anonymity, Virginia's Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb, 
seeking re-election next year, was pressing for creation of a 
judgeship in his own state. Republicans refused. 
</P>
<P>
	At another point, these sources added, Hatch wanted to make the  
legislation effective in 2001, after President Clinton leaves 
office and no longer can make appointments. Democrats refused. 
</P>
<P>
	The final deal was balanced politically. Among them, Arizona,  
Florida and Nevada have three Democratic senators and three 
Republicans. Clinton would be able to make the appointments, but it 
is unlikely the GOP-controlled Senate would act on them. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The amendment calls for two new judges for Nevada, three for  
Arizona and four for the middle district of Florida. It was 
inserted into a larger amendment that itself was slipped into a 
bill dealing with juvenile crime and gun control. It passed by 
voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	No one uttered a word about judgeships on the Senate floor.  
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Before departing for the weeklong Memorial Day break, House GOP  
lawmakers met privately to assess their rocky week and discuss what 
to do differently when they return. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., emerged from the session  
carrying a carved tomahawk he had been given earlier by the 
Sauk-Fox Indians, an Oklahoma tribe that once lived in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert was asked if he had used the weapon on Rep. Tom Coburn,  
R-Okla., who had tied the House in knots during the week on a 
farm-spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was Oklahoma Indians who gave it to me, so maybe they were  
giving me a signal,'' Hastert replied with a smile.

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Duo Seek To Assert Selves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Antonio Davis and Dale Davis are related --  
not by blood, but by basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers, trailing the best-of-7 NBA Eastern  
Conference finals after losing 93-90 to the New York Knicks, hope 
to utilize the inside game of the two 230-pounders Tuesday night in 
Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be more of a physical force,'' Antonio Davis said  
Monday after the team practiced following its first playoff loss 
this year ended a streak of 13 playoff wins at home. ``We let them 
get too many easy shots because we didn't get offensive rebounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Davis had seven rebounds, tying point guard Mark Jackson  
for the team lead Sunday. Dale Davis, the team's leading rebounder 
for the season, had only one offensive rebound among the five 
caroms he grabbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive rebounds, including 10 by Patrick Ewing, helped New  
York get 22 points on fast breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get back quick enough,'' Dale Davis said. ``We let  
them run on us too much, especially in the first half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York had 18 fast-break points in the first half, building a  
44-40 lead at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	``We stopped their running game in the second half. Tuesday we  
need to come out and do it from the start,'' said Dale Davis, who 
had 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Davis had six of his points in the third quarter and  
Antonio Davis scored seven of his 17 points in the fourth quarter, 
the only period in which Indiana outscored New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the fourth quarter, Antonio played as well as he's ever  
played for us,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ``Dale had a good 
third quarter, but we need more from him. Dale has got to be a 
force for us all the time he's on the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Davis thought Indiana may have started the game a little  
rusty, having gone a week since its last game -- when the Pacers 
completed a four-game sweep of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shouldn't be an excuse. We should have been ready. We  
weren't. New York was. Now they have the advantage in the series 
and we've got to take it back from them,'' Dale Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The playoffs are supposed to be physical, especially on the  
inside where the 6-foot-11, 230-pound Dale Davis spends most of his 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the physical part of the game,'' he said. ``I know I  
can hold my own with anyone in the game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Davises realize the importance of Tuesday's game with the  
series shifting to New York for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 next 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford to go to New York down 2-0. Now that they've  
won the first game, they're going to be more relaxed, feeling 
they've already done their job by beating us here,'' Dale Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've won on the road before and we are confident we can do it  
again,'' Antonio Davis said. ``This is a seven-game series. They 
took the first, we can't change that and we can't think about 
victories in New York until we take care of business here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford to put any more pressure on ourselves than  
that which is there from this being the conference finals,'' 
Antonio Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana is trying to advance past the conference finals for the  
first time after losing Game 7 on the road three times in the past 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
	New York, meanwhile, wants to reach the NBA Finals for the first  
time since 1994, when it lost to Houston in seven games after 
defeating Indiana 4-3 in the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These teams know each other,'' Dale Davis said. ``There are  
really no surprises, although this New York team is a little 
different than past ones. They have a much stronger bench and run a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patrick Ewing is still a big part of their team, but they have  
a lot more weapons in Latrell Sprewell, Marcus Camby and Chris 
Childs.''

<HEADLINE> Prep Star Could Be Top Baseball Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton may have an easier time  
playing professional baseball than finding cleats to fit his 
18 1/2-inch feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's huge feet haven't slowed his progress toward the top  
of the major league baseball draft list. The Raleigh Athens Drive 
prep star may be the No. 1 overall pick by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem. I guess I've grown up with them,''  
Hamilton said of his rather large feet. ``My shoe size stayed the 
same as my age up until I was 14, and then it took off. When I as 
14 I was wearing a size 16.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 200-pound outfielder-pitcher has a good chance to  
be the first high school player chosen No. 1 in the draft since 
Seattle selected a prep shortstop by the name of Alex Rodriguez in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Jennings, director of scouting for Tampa Bay, spent hours in  
meetings over the weekend with scouts who have watched Hamilton's 
every move for the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him pitch up to 96 mph, I've seen him hit homers and  
I've seen him hit an inside-the-park homer,'' Jennings said. ``He 
shows you what you want to see in a major league prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old left-hander hit .514 with 13 home runs in high  
school this past season, when teams chose to pitch to him instead 
of around him. Last week in an American Legion game, Hamilton was 
intentionally walked three times. When he finally got a chance to 
hit, be hit a homer. Then, after the game, he signed balls for 
players on the other team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton shrugs off all the attention he has received, calling  
it fun but hectic. 
</P>
<P>
	During one high school game for Athens, 55 scouts attended to  
watch him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Josh has been under such a microscope,'' said his father, Tony  
Hamilton. ``Tampa had people at 20 of the 25 games he played. And 
not just one, but two, three and four people. Everything he does, 
how he walks, talks, acts, they are taking notes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's how teams act when they're preparing to make a $3 million  
or $4 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's life has been consumed by baseball since he was 7,  
when he moved up to Little League two years ahead of his schedule 
and was coached by his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw the ball and hit the ball too hard for the kids his  
age,'' Tony Hamilton said. ``He played center field in Little 
League and he always stayed mad because he batted ninth. He said, 
`Why am I batting ninth? I can hit.' I told him he was the youngest 
and the smallest so he was going to hit ninth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is no longer the smallest, but some say simply the best  
prep prospect to come along in quite awhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never put a `can't miss' label on any player, there  
are risk factors,'' Jennings said. ``It is unfair to the player, 
but he has tremendous God-given ability. The thing I like most 
about him is Josh Hamilton likes to play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is already preparing for his foray on pro ball by  
taking half his batting practice with a wooden bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got pop. Wood or aluminum -- he could hit with a telephone  
pole,'' said Royals scout Paul Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's character also impresses scouts, who call him a  
`throw-back' type of athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to be something special because of the way  
he goes about his game. He's serious business,'' Faulk said. ``He 
goes about the game the way you should -- 100 percent. If you talk 
to the kid for five minutes, you know he's a good kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How good? Hamilton had several invites to attend his recent high  
school prom, but turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided it was best I didn't go,'' he said. ``I am trying to  
stay away from crowds and different groups. If something bad 
happened at the wrong time, I didn't want to be in that 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is quite aware of his future, and where he would like  
to end up -- in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really nervous about the draft, but (I'm) anxious to  
see what is going to happen, who I am going to go with,'' he said. 
``I guess I am ready to get started. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in first grade, we had to write a story about what  
you wanted to be when you grew up and I wrote that I want to be a 
professional baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton begins living his dream Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Luyendyk Crashes in Final Indy 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Arie Luyendyk tapped the brakes and spun out  
of control. Amid the smoke from burning rubber, he slammed backward 
into the third-turn wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly the way the Flying Dutchman wanted to end his  
career. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 15th and final appearance in the Indianapolis 500,  
Luyendyk seemed to have everything going his way. He started from 
the pole, leading 63 laps, ready to enjoy his retirement as a 
three-time winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he got careless. Maybe a little greedy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have to say to myself, `Why did I make a move like that?'''  
he asked. ``I really feel stupid right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, in the lead after 117 of the 200 laps, made a move to  
the inside to pass Tyce Carlson. When Carlson eased off the 
throttle, Luyendyk had no room and as his right front wheel drew 
even with Carlson's left rear tire, the Dutchman's G Force Aurora 
began to wobble and shake. 
</P>
<P>
	In a matter of seconds, it was over. Luyendyk touched the  
brakes, spun around backward and hit the wall. He wound up 22nd, 
his worst finish at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for going out like John Elway or Michael Jordan in this  
year of the retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a trip to Victory Lane for a swig of milk, Luyendyk  
took a humbling golf cart ride back to the garage to mull his fate. 
A huge ovation from the crowd seemed to ease his anguish. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got out of the car, the crowd was going nuts,'' he  
said. ``I was trying to take it all in. It's been great throughout 
the years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-year-old driver, who first won in 1990 and added a second  
Indy victory in 1997, announced before the Indy Racing League 
season that this would be his final ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The 500, where he holds almost every speed record and has won  
more money than any other driver, was his only race this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the best car here today that I've ever had,'' he said.  
``The car gave me so much confidence. It was too good to be true, 
and this was probably part of my demise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the crash, Luyendyk climbed from the battered car and  
peered down as if he couldn't comprehend what had happened. As he 
walked toward the infield grass, he slapped his right glove on the 
hood of the red safety truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have known better than to be racing the traffic that  
hard,'' he said. ``I probably just got too relaxed out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk felt he was crowded a bit in the turn by Carlson,  
forcing him to tap the brakes and send his car skidding into the 
wall. Television replays seemed to show the blame clearly belonged 
to the more experienced driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my fault,'' Luyendyk conceded. ``I was the guy making  
the pass. There's no excuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carlson's radio went out during the race, which meant he  
couldn't communicate with his trackside spotters as Luyendyk 
approached. But the 28-year-old driver saw the approaching car in 
his mirror and tried to make room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I even went off the throttle,'' Carlson said. ``Arie's a great  
guy, and I never would have gotten in his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk wavered a bit when asked if he might change his mind  
about retiring, but that was merely the competitor in the man 
showing through. He's looking forward to spending time with his 
family, in addition to working as a television analyst on IRL 
events and assisting the Treadway Racing team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to stick with my plan,'' he said. ``I'll be back  
here next year in another capacity and enjoy the race. ... But I 
know when I come back next year, I'll start kicking myself again 
for what happened here today.''

<HEADLINE>  Belarus Mourns 53 Stampede Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Mourners poured into an underground  
passage in Minsk today, laying carnations and lilacs along the 
steps and floor where 50 teen-agers and three police officers were 
trampled to death as a crowd tried to leave an outdoor concert. 
</P>
<P>
	About 150 others were injured in the stampede Sunday night and  
78 were hospitalized, said Vladimir Yermoshin, the head of the 
Minsk city council. Seven victims were in critical condition Monday 
night and 32 were in intensive care, the Health Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and friends mobbed hospital waiting rooms, calling out  
the names of people they feared had been caught in the panic. Every 
hour, TV and radio stations broadcast telephone hot-line numbers 
for parents anxious to find their missing children. 
</P>
<P>
	President Alexander Lukashenko offered condolences to the  
victims' families and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please do not accuse or judge anybody. ... This is a mournful  
occasion for the whole country, as well as for the families of the 
dead,'' he told Belarusian leaders. ``Please do not allow this to 
split society or become an object of a political game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He announced two days of national mourning, and appointed  
Premier Sergei Ling to head a commission investigating the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the evening, however, he said that the casualties were  
due to ``carelessness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've treated these gatherings, rallies, too carelessly,''  
Lukashenko said on state television, adding that democracy led to 
an attitude of ``let's rally and walk until someone gets suffocated 
somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 2,500 teen-agers had been crowded onto a lawn outside  
Minsk's Sports Palace on Sunday, and some witnesses said the crowd 
was closer to 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were attracted by leaflets, posters and newspaper ads  
promising free beer, gym bags, TV sets and other prizes to people 
who could collect the biggest number of Magna cigarette box-tops 
and bring them to the Sports Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	The party started at noon Sunday and was supposed to go on until  
after sunset, with a rock concert on a grassy area outside the 
stadium. As the concert got under way, teen-agers danced and drank. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the rain and hail started, and hundreds of young people  
made a run for the nearby Nemiga metro station. But somebody fell 
on the rain-slickened concrete of the underground passage -- police 
said teen-age girls in high-heels were the first to fall -- and 
others followed. The crowd kept surging in, running over those who 
had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were trampled to death, while others suffocated. Forty-two  
of the dead were girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was such a huge crowd. I was carried away by it when it  
rushed to the underpass,'' said Vitaly Milentyev, 19. ``I was 
lucky. I managed to get out of the crowd literally by going between 
the legs of other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I will remember a young girl who died in my arms for the rest  
of my life,'' said Milentyev. He said most of the crowd appeared 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonid Okulish, one of the heads of the company that organized  
the concert, appeared close to tears in a TV interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not understand how it could have happened,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Next for Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- More than six hours of negotiations  
earned Felix Trinidad Jr. an extra $500,000 and cleared the way for 
his welterweight unification fight against Oscar De La Hoya on 
Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King was happy with the deal that matches IBF  
champion Trinidad with De La Hoya, the WBC titleholder, at the new 
Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything turned out as we wished. In the end, we will  
present the match that all the world wants to see,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	If King was happy, Trinidad's father and manager, Felix Trinidad  
Sr., was less thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly I could have negotiated a better contract ... but it's  
the match that all the world wants to see and the time has come. 
It's past time for Tito to confront Oscar De La Hoya and knock him 
out to show for real who is the best,'' Trinidad Sr. said after the 
agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The final deal pays Trinidad $8.5 million and King $2 million.  
Trinidad also gets $300,000 for training costs and both men get an 
additional $4 each for every pay-per-view customer over 850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will earn $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's negotiation provided an extra $500,000 for Trinidad  
over the original agreement and locks the Puerto Rican fighter into 
a share of what his father anticipates will be a record number of 
pay-per-view customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, 35-0, scored the 30th knockout of his career when he  
stopped Hugo Pineda on Saturday night. De La Hoya is 31-0 with 22 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, who lost 18 pounds over two months to reach the  
welterweight limit of 147 pounds for the Pineda fight, was 
confident after Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an important triumph on the way to my greatest  
challenge,'' he said. ``This was a way for me to demonstrate to (De 
La Hoya) I'm ready for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya suffered a sprained hand when he defended his title  
May 24 against Oba Carr, but said he would have time to recuperate 
before getting into training to face Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it on,'' De La Hoya said. ``It will be the fight of  
the century.''

<HEADLINE>  Bombs Kill 16 Yugoslav Civilians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO missiles killed at least 16  
people when they smashed into a hospital and a retirement home 
today in Yugoslavia, said Serb officials, amid growing concern 
about civilian casualties from the alliance's bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance acknowledged striking a military barracks and an  
ammunition storage area in the area around Surdulica, 220 miles 
southeast of Belgrade, but would not confirm hitting the civilian 
sites and the reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Condemning the ``murdering of civilians'' in Serbia, President  
Slobodan Milosevic said the latest attacks endangered fragile peace 
efforts, which continue this week with talks with the Finnish 
president. Russia's Balkans envoy also announced plans to meet 
again this week with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav government reiterated that it accepts principles  
set forth by the Group of Eight major powers for ending the Kosovo 
conflict. But Milosevic's latest statement still fell short of 
Western demands for the makeup of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Alliance officials insisted there will be ``no negotiations''  
with Belgrade, which they said must halt the violence in Kosovo, 
withdraw its forces from the province and allow NATO troops into 
Kosovo to police the peace for ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, National Security Council spokesman Michael  
Hammer expressed skepticism that Milosevic is serious about peace. 
``Everybody's wondering whether we're on the edge of a 
breakthrough,'' Hammer said. ``I think it's a bit premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The European Union on Monday also demanded that Milosevic  
translate his words into action and show an ``unambiguous and 
verifiable'' commitment to a Western plan for Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, despite being put on the defensive again over its  
targeting practices, pressed ahead with its escalated air campaign. 
In Kosovo, U.S. A-10 ``Warthog'' jets struck Serb forces clashing 
with ethnic Albanian rebels in the hills along the Albanian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, suffered another blackout Monday  
evening shortly after air-raid sirens signaled a new round of NATO 
attacks. The private Beta news agency reported that two transformer 
stations outside Belgrade had been struck for the second time in 
less than a week, causing the outage. 
</P>
<P>
	Western journalists taken to Surdulica by Serb authorities saw a  
scene of devastation, with 11 bodies lying under sheets outside the 
shattered medical complex and four others, those of elderly women, 
on stretchers in front of the retirement home. A human hand was 
visible, protruding from the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers were still pulling bodies from the rubble at  
midafternoon, more than a dozen hours after the attack. Survivors 
told of four blasts shortly after a plane passed over the complex 
on the city's outskirts, just after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs struck the main hospital building, housing Serb refugees  
from Croatia, and a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Yugoslav authorities, two missiles hit the main  
building of the Special Hospital for Tuberculosis and Pulmonary 
Diseases. Two other missiles struck a retirement home within the 
complex, where 35 elderly people were living. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosions crushed a wing of the hospital, stripping off the  
tops of towering pine trees and scorching them. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the wall, the ceiling, everything fell on me,'' said Mica  
Pjevac, a Serb refugee from Croatia. ``I thought it was the end of 
my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surdulica was the scene of an errant missile strike April 27,  
which killed at least 15 people. NATO said at the time that a 
laser-guided missile had veered off course from its intended 
target, an army barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate attack, Serb state media reported 10 people were  
killed and at least 20 were wounded Monday when NATO missiles 
slammed into the central Serbian city of Novi Pazar. The report 
could not immediately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance has acknowledged killing civilians in its air  
campaign, now in its third month, but insists all such casualties 
are unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, NATO spokesman Col. Konrad Freytag insisted that  
``all munitions hit the planned aiming points'' in the Surdulica 
area and the alliance could not confirm reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came a day after 11 civilians were reported killed  
when NATO missiles sent a bridge in central Serbia crashing into a 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report Monday about civilian casualties, The New York Times  
quoted refugees in Albania as saying Serb soldiers used 700 Kosovo 
Albanians as human shields. The refugees were herded into a 
warehouse in a southern Kosovo village hours before a May 13 NATO 
attack that Serb officials and survivors said killed more than 80 
people, the paper quoted refugees as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials at the time denied the refugees were used as  
shields, saying they were spending the night on vacant ground in 
Korisa when NATO bombs rained down on them. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said that the site was being used as a military  
camp and command post. 
</P>
<P>
	``They used us as human shields,'' said Hazhere Palushi, one of  
three Albanian survivors quoted by the Times. ``It was all 
planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic front, Russia's Balkans envoy, Viktor  
Chernomyrdin, announced plans to travel to Germany on Tuesday for 
more talks on the crisis. He was to meet in Bonn with Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, a spokesman at his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were expected to have dinner with German Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder. On Wednesday they are expected to fly to Belgrade for 
more talks with Milosevic, according to Chernomyrdin and German 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic  
in Yugoslavia. Although Serbs consider it the cradle of their 
national identity, 90 percent of its prewar population of 2 million 
was ethnic Albanian. Belgrade insists that its military action in 
Kosovo is necessary to quell a terrorist-led secessionist drive.

Korisa when NATO bombs rained down on them. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said that the site was being used as a military  
camp and command post. 
</P>
<P>
	``They used us as human shields,'' said Hazhere Palushi, one of  
three Albanian survivors quoted by the Times. ``It was all 
planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the diplomatic front, Russia's Balkans envoy, Viktor  
Chernomyrdin, announced plans to travel to Germany on Tuesday for 
more talks on the crisis. He was to meet in Bonn with Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President Martti 
Ahtisaari, a spokesman at his office said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were expected to have dinner with German Chancellor Gerhard  
Schroeder. On Wednesday they are expected to fly to Belgrade for 
more talks with Milosevic, according to Chernomyrdin and German 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic  
in Yugoslavia. Although Serbs consider it the cradle of their 
national identity, 90 percent of its prewar population of 2 million 
was ethnic Albanian. Belgrade insists that its military action in 
Kosovo is necessary to quell a terrorist-led secessionist drive.

<HEADLINE> '99 Peach Crop Expected To Be Good / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT VALLEY, Ga. (AP) -- Thousands of plump peaches are  
pirouetting down conveyor belts and into crates at farms around 
central Georgia this month as workers prepare to ship what experts 
predict may be the best crop in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The noise of workers and machinery processing the fruit is music  
to the ears of growers, who have been clobbered by extreme weather 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Growers are delighted with the early quality of the 1999  
harvest, which began two weeks ago. Spring weather was peachy for 
peaches -- warm and dry with abundant sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have good quality and good color,'' said Bill McGehee, a  
partner at the Big Six Farm near Fort Valley. ``Peaches are like 
humans. They need sunshine. Sun is what colors the fruit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After cleaning, grading, sorting and packaging, workers load the  
peaches into refrigerated trailers for their trip to market. On a 
recent day, Big Six was preparing shipments for Puerto Rico, 
Canada, New Jersey and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Valley is located in the heart of the Georgia's peach  
growing area, and signs of the importance of the $50 million crop 
are everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Peaches are emblazoned on everything, from the water tower that  
looms over town to the sign in front of the Peach Industrial Park. 
</P>
<P>
	When it's a bad year for peaches, everyone in the area feels it  
economically. In 1996, growers lost 92 percent of the crop to a 
series of late spring freezes. 
</P>
<P>
	Cold weather isn't a problem this year, but some growers say the  
rest of the harvest -- which stretches from mid-May to mid-August -- 
won't turn out well unless the state gets some much needed rain. 
Central Georgia is five to six inches short of rain this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kathy Taylor, a peach specialist with the University of  
Georgia Extension Service, is optimistic about the crop. She 
predicts this year will be the best since 1994, despite a shortage 
of chill hours during the warm winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees need temperatures below 45 degrees for several hundred  
hours during the winter to produce a crop in the spring. Growers 
helped offset the lack of chill hours with a chemical substitute. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Agricultural Statistics Service rates the crop as 35  
percent excellent, 28 percent good, 17 percent fair, 11 percent 
poor and 9 percent very poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a better-than-average crop,'' said grower Chop Evans  
of Evans Farm, a major producer. ``The quality is good to 
excellent. The dry weather has certainly hurt us a little in size, 
but what you lose in size you gain in taste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They taste great,'' added Betty Hotchkiss, spokeswoman for  
Lane Packing Co., another major producer. ``The sunshine we're 
having gives them a great flavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGehee said he is optimistic about the future of Georgia  
peaches. His farm grows 30 to 40 varieties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing a real appreciation for the taste of Eastern  
peaches,'' he said. ``We feel we've had taste all along, but 
because of varying weather patterns, they didn't always look good. 
Now we feel we have the taste and the good appearance.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Resumes on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Microsoft Corp.'s trial resumes for the  
final phase of testimony, the government will urge the judge to 
focus on the software company's aggressive behavior toward 
competitors earlier this decade and on its dominance today. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, though, wants U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield  
Jackson to look to the future, when Microsoft believes its Windows 
software will face unprecedented competition from fledgling 
technologies 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust trial was scheduled to resume Tuesday after a  
13-week recess and despite secret efforts to settle the case. Key 
differences remain, such as how Microsoft can continue adding new 
technology to its the Windows operating system without undercutting 
rivals offering similar software products. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft must convince Jackson that federal intervention is  
unnecessary to maintain the robust high-tech industry robust. The 
company also must minimize the ill effects of its past actions on 
some of its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and Microsoft each have identified three  
witnesses who will testify during this phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Franklin Fisher, an economist who testified previously for the  
government, was to take the stand again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's most important witness will be Garry Norris, an  
IBM Corp. manager who will describe pressure Microsoft allegedly 
exerted on IBM to sacrifice its rival OS/2 operating-system 
software during the early 1990s. That software competed directly 
with Windows until its popularity waned in late 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last courtroom testimony, America Online Inc.  
finalized its $10 billion purchase of Netscape Communications 
Corp., the Internet pioneer whose Web browser software competes 
with Microsoft's own Internet Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice lawyer David Boies has said Microsoft's emphasis on the  
merger was a sideshow, but the judge remarked previously that the 
deal ``might be a very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that AOL, as the world's largest Internet  
provider, could help revive Netscape's popularity as a browser, and 
that other alliances would encourage development of handheld, 
wireless devices that do not use Windows and could displace 
Microsoft's importance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deposition last month with AOL Chairman Steve Case,  
Microsoft also suggested that future high-speed Internet 
connections for consumers threaten to reduce the industry's 
reliance on Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Case has taken an unusually high-profile role in recent weeks  
lobbying Congress and federal regulators to force cable companies 
to allow their subscribers to use his AOL software with those 
companies' ultra-fast data pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Software used across such high-speed networks typically can go  
with whatever operating system a consumer has on his computer. 
Microsoft argues that, in effect, the Internet itself becomes a 
competing software platform, threatening to make Windows less 
important. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also contends that fast Internet connections allow  
consumers to more easily retrieve even large software programs, 
which could contradict government charges that Netscape was 
prevented from being able to adequately distribute its rival 
browser software.

<HEADLINE> All Nippon Airlines Unveils Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. will cut 10 percent  
of its staff and establish a new discount airline as part of a 
broad reform strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's second largest airline said it would cut its  
28,000-person global work force by 10 percent by March 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the cuts will be made at the ANA parent company, where  
1,700 jobs will be trimmed through early retirement and by limiting 
new hiring. The other cuts will be made at subsidiaries and 
affiliates, though the company did not say where. 
</P>
<P>
	A nearly two-year-long economic crisis has curbed demand for  
plane tickets in Asia, and a stubborn recession has dampened travel 
demand at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the establishment of new discount airlines such as  
Skymark Airlines Co. has put pressure on big flyers to cut fares. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business environment in Japan is extremely difficult right  
now,'' ANA President and CEO Kichisaburo Nomura said in the 
statement. ``Many of the reforms we will undertake are going to be 
challenging, even painful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's salary will be cut by 25 percent, the company  
announced, though it didn't say how much he would make. 
</P>
<P>
	ANA will set up its own low-cost airline this year that will  
focus on routes out of the western Japan city of Osaka, the company 
said without providing details. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement follows a dismal earnings report from ANA last  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	ANA suffered a net loss of $54.46 million, deeper than its  
year-earlier loss of $22.15 million. The loss stemmed from higher 
operating costs and a one-time charge to pay workers who retired 
early under an existing plan to cut jobs.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Spreading in Dry Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Fla. (AP) -- A wildfire burning through part of the  
Okefenokee swamp grew to 50,000 acres Monday, and hot, dry weather 
was expected to cause the fire to spread further. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightning-sparked fire pushed into southern Georgia over the  
holiday weekend, moving into an area near the small community of 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread a fire in an  
area between the Arizona-Utah line and Grand Canyon National Park 
on land controlled by the federal Bureau of Land Management. The 
fire had burned across 10,800 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Another lightning wildfire on federal and state land 80 miles  
west of Phoenix had burned 14,600 acres. The area is home to the 
endangered desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in southern Nevada called in reinforcements to help  
battle a blaze that had charred 7,000 acres in rugged terrain about 
85 miles northeast of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's Joshua Tree National Park, a 12,000-acre  
wildfire was nearly contained as crews started work on restoring 
the fragile desert habitat blackened by the blaze, which was also 
started by lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 firefighters were fighting the Florida fire on the  
ground, and various agencies were using helicopters and aerial 
tankers to help douse the flames with water, said Gene Madden, 
spokesman for the Florida Division of Forestry.

<HEADLINE> Rider, Blazers Ready for Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Looking more like J.R. Ewing, or maybe the  
Oakland Kid, Isaiah ``J.R.'' Rider moseyed into practice wearing a 
straw cowboy hat and pronounced the Portland Trail Blazers still 
confident despite their Game 1 loss to San Antonio in the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's up, y'all?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, San Antonio's up 1-0 going into tonight's second game of  
the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider's hat had a hole in the brim, ripped, he said, by a fan  
who tried to grab it away from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was like, `Wow, I want that hat,''' Rider said. ``It was a  
tussle, but I got it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was good practice for the intense tussle the two teams expect  
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs remember that their only loss of these playoffs came  
against Minnesota at home in Game 2 of the first round. The Blazers 
remember that they won Game 2 at Utah en route to their 
second-round triumph over the Jazz. And both teams believe they 
will play much better than they did in San Antonio's 80-76 victory 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect a big difference,'' the Spurs' Mario Elie said. ``Us  
having four or five days off, especially when you're used to 
playing every other day, Avery and I were talking about how we were 
a little winded, just not used to playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``And Portland having to play an emotional game that Thursday  
against Utah, then fly all day Friday and have to play an afternoon 
game, that's tough. I expect both teams to have a lot better 
performance tomorrow. It's going to be a lot more intense, a lot 
more physical and probably higher scoring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Gregg Popovich said he hopes it was the layoff that caused  
San Antonio's offensive problems in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discipline-wise, we took short cuts quite a bit offensively,  
and we've got to change that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider managed a tough 13 points Saturday, eight coming in the  
third quarter. But he was a non-factor the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider said he still won't be the main offensive force as long as  
Rasheed Wallace stays hot. Wallace had a career playoff high 28 
points in Game 1 but missed a wide-open 20-footer that would have 
tied it with six seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich said he will use Sean Elliott, David Robinson and Tim  
Duncan against Wallace from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Sheed going like he's going, we're going to go to him  
every time until they figure it out,'' Rider said. ``I know how to 
play this game. I can get mine in other ways. I've got to bring the 
energy and I'll get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers also need more help from Arvydas Sabonis, who had  
five points, six rebounds and four turnovers in Game 1. Sabonis 
said he never got going after two early fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just made it hard,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's big game came after he got an early technical foul,  
then got into a heated discussion with Dunleavy. The coach left 
Wallace in the game, and was glad he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said his game feeds on emotion, and he is grateful  
Dunleavy is the kind of coach who doesn't harbor ill feelings after 
such run-ins. Wallace also thinks he's sometimes unfairly targeted 
by officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my personal opinion a whole lot of those referees have  
egos. You can't go up and talk to them,'' Wallace said. ``They say 
that I've got a bad attitude and that I cuss too much. But that's 
only one side of the coin. They cuss at us. If you talk back at 
them, they'll hit you with a technical. I don't think they're 
baiting. I think it's more they're sensitive. That's how they 
are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, Wallace said, ``They don't like me. I know that.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers say turnovers were a main reason for the Game 1  
loss. Portland had 16, twice as many as the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to have a chance to win, we need other guys to step up  
and have good games also,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. 
``That's the good thing about our team. They could be over there 
worrying about Rasheed all day long and it's not Rasheed tomorrow, 
it's somebody else. That's been the strength of our team all year 
long. You don't necessarily know who to prepare for, who it can be 
on any night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, meanwhile, want more help for Tim Duncan and David  
Robinson, who scored 21 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, we've got to shoot the ball better,'' Robinson  
said. ``We shoot 40 percent, it's going to be tough for us to put 
together a good game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, San Antonio was good enough for its sixth straight win in  
the playoffs. Three more and the Spurs have their first trip to the 
NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had five days off. We weren't really in-synch the way we  
should have been,'' Avery Johnson said. ``But whether you win ugly, 
whether you win pretty, it really doesn't matter during this time 
of the year, as long as you win.''

<HEADLINE> Corey Quits As Canadiens President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Ronald Corey said on Monday he is stepping down  
as president of the Montreal Canadiens Monday, six weeks after 
hockey's most storied franchise finished last in its division and 
out of the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventeen years in charge of the Montreal Canadiens is  
enough,'' Corey told a news conference. ``It takes quite a man to 
do 17 years in Montreal, as (NHL commissioner) Gary Bettman told me 
this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corey, 60, said it was time for a ``more relaxing life.'' His  
resignation takes effect July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey became president of the Canadiens in 1982 and the team won  
Stanley Cups in 1986 and 1993. But Montreal finished out of the 
playoffs this season for the second time in five years with a 
32-39-11 record, 11th in the Eastern Conference and with their 
lowest points total (not counting the lockout-shortened season) 
since 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
	``While hockey may be going through some tough times, I have no  
doubt that the Montreal Canadiens' dynasty will continue to thrive 
and that Montrealers will see many more Stanley Cups in the years 
ahead,'' Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Arnett, president and chief executive officer of Molson,  
said Corey had approached him about a month ago about leaving. An 
executive search firm has been hired to conduct a search for the 
successor to Corey and the club hopes a new president will be in 
place before next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always done big things for the Canadiens and within four  
years he brought the Canadiens a Stanley Cup,'' said Eric Molson, 
chairman of the board of directors of Molson, which owns the Molson 
Centre and the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could not have given us a bigger gift when in '93 he  
completed our case of 24 Stanley Cups. He's not only a great man 
and an important figure, but a great member of the community in 
Quebec and Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corey was heavily involved in the move from the Montreal Forum  
to the Molson Centre in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the driving force behind both the concept and the  
construction of the Molson Centre, a project that he managed from 
beginning to end,'' said Molson. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who described his relationship with Corey as cordial,  
thanked Corey for all his efforts on behalf of the club. So did 
Molson, who seemed genuinely moved by the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey paid tribute to colleagues, players and fans, and made a  
point of thanking Bettman for helping organize the Maurice Richard 
Trophy to reward the league's top goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also noted that Canadian clubs are working at a  
disadvantage because of the devalued Canadian dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not working the same environment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Corey said his love for the game had not changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still enjoy every second of it,'' he said. Referring to the  
playoffs, he said ``that type of hockey will be back in Montreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he took time to thank the many fans of the Canadiens, whom  
he called Canada's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere we have fans,'' he said. ``So many fans, always  
encouraging us and I want to thank them, all over the country.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Observes Memorial Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- President Clinton asked Americans on the  
century's last Memorial Day to rededicate themselves -- through a 
commitment to the campaign in Kosovo -- ``to another hundred years 
of our liberty, our prosperity, our optimism and our common 
humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the NATO campaign against ethnic cleansing in  
Kosovo the central theme of his holiday address today at Arlington 
National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	Kosovo, he said, ``is a very small province in a small country.  
But it is a big test of what we believe in -- our commitment to 
leave to our children a world where people are not uprooted and 
ravaged and slaughtered en masse because of their race, their 
ethnicity or their religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the amphitheater in the heart of the cemetery, Clinton  
acknowledged public ambivalence about America's leading role in 
securing the province for its ethnic Albanian population driven out 
by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that many Americans believe that this is not our  
fight,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But remember why many of the people are laying in these graves  
out here -- because of what happened in Europe, and because of what 
was allowed to go on too long before people intervened. What we are 
doing today will save lives, including American lives, in the 
future and it will give our children a better, safer world to live 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before his remarks, Clinton, assisted by a uniformed military  
aide, placed a wreath of red, white and blue flowers at the Tomb of 
the Unknowns. He slid his hand down the length of blue ribbon 
before pausing in silence, his head bowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our entire history is written in this ground,'' he later  
observed of the 200 rolling, green acres crowded by some 250,000 
small white stones marking the graves of veterans from every 
conflict, from the American Revolution through the Persian Gulf War 
and Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again and again, America has been tested in the 20th century,  
coming through it all down to the present day with even greater 
blessings of liberty and prosperity,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to our brave men and women in uniform, our nation has  
never been more secure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president is due to address the Kosovo conflict again on  
Wednesday, when he delivers a commencement speech at the United 
States Air Force Academy, and in a private meeting at the White 
House Thursday with his military advisory panel, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff.

<HEADLINE> Union-Car Hauler Nearing Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiations between the Teamsters and  
new-car haulers today edged toward a midnight strike deadline in 
the first test at the bargaining table for union president James P. 
Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike could mean longer waits for hot-selling vehicles and  
leave manufacturing plants without spaces to park vehicles coming 
off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a threatened strike beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT  
Tuesday, talks stalled over management proposals that would 
establish a lower pay scale for newly hired drivers and permit 
hiring of part-time workers, spokesmen for both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demands for concessions are still on the table,'' Hoffa  
said in an interview as negotiations went into the evening. ``I 
told them these are 'strikable' issues. I made that very clear to 
them.'' Management officials said the proposals are essential to 
meet competition from railroads and non-union haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	The haulers also demanded more flexible work schedules while the  
Teamsters sought boosts in wages and benefits and retirement pay 
for employees retiring after 25 years. The union also wants to 
block the haulers from giving union jobs to Mexican trucking 
companies, something the haulers claimed they have no plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that Hoffa is a factor. The son of legendary  
Teamsters leader James R. Hoffa was elected last December in the 
aftermath of a campaign finance scandal, and personally led the 
union negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important set of talks for Hoffa,'' said union  
spokesman Chip Roth. ``He'll be judged on his ability to deliver 
for the members. He knows the members will be watching him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said in the interview that he felt ``invigorated'' by  
leading the bargaining talks. Asked if the membership was watching 
closely, he said, ``I certainly hope so. That's why I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief management negotiator, said Hoffa's personal  
stake in the talks ``can't be discounted as a factor. It's his 
first national contract. Sure, it is a political concern that he 
has. But we're attempting at the table to reduce that as a 
factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics, yard and  
office workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides dueled publicly over the financial state of the  
unionized car haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth cited the industry's ``record profits,'' adding, ``This is  
not an industry in need.'' Hunter said statements about record 
profits were ``pure propaganda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
Inc., said a strike would have an impact within days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some plants could be affected in a day or two because they'd  
run out of room to park vehicles that are coming off the assembly 
line,'' Healy said. He added that dealers' inventories overall are 
``normal to slightly below normal.'' Roth, the union spokesman, 
said a strike would mean ``people would have to wait for the 
hottest-selling cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Adler of General Motors Corp. said, ``We've got contingency  
plans'' but he did not specify them. He said that during a 
car-haulers strike in 1995, the company allowed dealers to pick up 
cars from factories. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Vella, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co., said only that the  
automaker was ``watching the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne, spokesman for the management negotiators of the  
National Automobile Transporters labor division, said the 17 
companies hauled more than 15 million cars last year. But he 
insisted the revenue-producing miles for car deliveries has 
decreased. 
</P>
<P>
	``The indicators to show the fiscal health of the companies are  
all downward because of the competition of the non-union trucking 
companies and the railroads,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Duchesne, 71 percent of the new cars now leave the  
manufacturing plant by rail, compared to 29 percent by the union 
carriers. Other competition comes from non-union haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a year in wages and  
benefits, with salaries at $55,000. The Teamsters said that 
management wants to pay newly hired drivers 30 percent less than 
the contract wage, with gradual increases eventually equalizing the 
pay.

<HEADLINE>  Weary Stewart Running on Empty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After covering nearly 1,100 miles in 10  
hours -- with a jet ride and a couple of helicopter hops thrown in -- 
you'd think Tony Stewart would spend the next day relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Think again.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was going full speed again today, hopping on yet another  
flight so he could attend the awards dinner for the Indianapolis 
500 drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little better today,'' he said. ``(But) I haven't felt  
right all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Go figure. Stewart became the first driver to finish both the  
Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day Sunday, 
covering 1,090 miles in two states and two time zones in two very 
different cars. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not even mentioning the queasy stomach during his  
hard-driving, high-flying, fast-moving adventure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely worth doing once,'' he said. ``The crowds'  
response at both places was definitely the highlight of the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart wrapped up his double quest in spectacular fashion  
Sunday night, charging from last to fourth in the Coca-Cola after 
finishing ninth at Indy. The finish moved him to fifth in the 
Winston Cup point standings. 
</P>
<P>
	But the long day took its toll.  
</P>
<P>
	Aside from two small bagels for breakfast and a couple of Power  
Bars, he didn't eat all day and was sick for the last 100 laps. As 
he climbed out of his Pontiac in front of a crowd of friends and 
media, his legs gave out. He sat next to his car for several 
minutes looking dazed before he was put on a stretcher and taken to 
the track hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused intravenous fluids, so doctors gave him water and  
Gatorade and cooled him down with ice packs. He was released after 
about 30 minutes and went back to his trailer to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt good when I got out of the car at Indy. Physically, I  
didn't feel real bad,'' he said. ``About lap 80, I was starting to 
feel sick because I was getting hot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His crew packed a few ice packs around him, and Stewart said he  
felt better. But with about 100 laps to go, he was barely hanging 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never use the headrest in cars and I used the headrest the  
last 60-70 laps,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two drivers had tried the double before Stewart, who drove  
in the Indy Racing League for three years before switching to 
NASCAR's Winston Cup Circuit this season. Now he knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	After gripping a steering wheel for three hours and trying to  
tame a car with handling problems at Indy, Stewart was whisked away 
on a golf cart to a helicopter waiting in the infield near turn 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	He was flown to the Indianapolis airport where his sponsor, The  
Home Depot, had its private jet waiting for the 65-minute flight to 
North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart changed into his NASCAR driving suit and caught a quick  
nap on the flight, stretching out on the couch in the back of the 
jet after guzzling water and Powerade to rehydrate. Then it was 
into another helicopter for a quick flight to Lowe's Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	All that, and he still had another 600 miles to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``This was too hard to do,'' said Stewart, who probably won't be  
doing the double again next year. ``That made for a very long 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't regret it, though. When he heard the strains of  
``Taps'' play at Indy, Stewart got chills. And when he arrived at 
the Coca-Cola, some 150,000 fans stood and gave a deafening cheer 
as the helicopter flew low around the speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an experience I'll never forget,'' he said. ``To  
come in here and see the reaction from the crowd and to hear the 
applause at the drivers' introductions at the 500, I wouldn't trade 
it for anything.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Police Shoot Homeless Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Every day Margaret Mitchell pushed her  
grocery cart up trendy La Brea Avenue, passing expensive antique 
shops and en-vogue restaurants, looking for all the world like she 
was going somewhere important. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-year-old mentally ill woman didn't really have any  
appointments. She didn't even have a home. But she was a fixture on 
this thoroughfare where a cup of coffee costs $3.50 and doorknobs 
sell for $50. 
</P>
<P>
	She was well-groomed, didn't panhandle and rarely spoke, say  
those who knew her. When merchants tried to give her food, she 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mitchell no longer strolls along La Brea. On May 21, after  
living on this street for more than a year, she was shot to death 
by a bicycle policeman new to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Larrigan, 27, and his partner, Kathy Clark, 29, had asked  
if Mrs. Mitchell's cart was stolen. Larrigan, with five years' 
experience under his gun belt, said he felt his life was threatened 
when the 5-foot-1 woman thrust a screwdriver at him. 
</P>
<P>
	He jumped to avoid her, fell to one knee and fired one shot into  
her chest, police said. She died at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, the Police Commission and the LAPD are separately  
investigating an incident that has taken on racial overtones. Mrs. 
Mitchell was black; Larrigan is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Police Chief Bernard Parks said the officers  
appeared to have done nothing wrong, and he blasted accusations of 
bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to carry the burden of racism in the country  
of the United States for the last 200 years and place it on those 
officers' shoulders,'' said Parks, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the homeless and the mentally ill also are using  
Mrs. Mitchell's death as an emblem for their causes. And on La 
Brea, white and black merchants who knew Mrs. Mitchell are 
incensed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all horrified. It's just so stupid,'' said Avril  
Clinch, as she wept inside her employer's antique shop. ``That 
woman never did any harm to anyone. And she gets shot to death over 
a shopping cart?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Tie, her colleague at Chateau de la Companie, said he  
saw the woman every morning. ``At first, I didn't even know she was 
homeless,'' he said. ``She was clean. She wore a different outfit 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching her stride down the street, head bent, ``she looked  
like she always had a purpose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next door, at the popular La Brea Bakery, manager Lora Davis saw  
Mrs. Mitchell the morning she died. Usually, the woman slept on the 
sidewalk or the bus bench fronting a nearby phone company office. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was talking to herself,'' Davis said. ``That was the first  
time I'd ever heard her speak.'' At closing time, Davis and her 
employees often stand at the back door and give away leftover 
bread. Mrs. Mitchell never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never asked for anything,'' Davis said. ``It's just so  
frightening to think that anyone would get shot over waving a 
screwdriver. None of it makes sense to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Parks said witnesses substantiate Larrigan's assertion  
that Mrs. Mitchell lunged at him. Attorney Leo Terrell, who 
represents son Richard Mitchell, said there are several witnesses 
who say the woman posed no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Mitchell has said that his mother was a college-educated  
former bank employee whose mental health began deteriorating over 
the past few years. She heard voices, her son said, but refused 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	She lived off-and-on with him and his wife until about a year  
ago, he said. Under state law, a person cannot be unwillingly 
institutionalized unless they pose a threat to themselves or 
others. His mother was not violent, Mitchell said. But he was 
frustrated at not being able to force her into treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly paranoid, she preferred the street.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Pepper inhabits the same stretch of La Brea that Mrs.  
Mitchell did. He usually saw her twice a day, he said, but it took 
months to get the subdued woman to smile at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a refined lady. She never bothered no one,'' said  
Pepper, sitting on the corner of Fourth Street, where a shrine of 
flowers, candles and a shopping cart mark the intersection where 
she died on a Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pepper didn't see Mrs. Mitchell on any given day, he went out  
looking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Females are not the weaker sex,'' he said. ``But they really  
are preyed on out here on the streets. We watch out for each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> 'Phantom Menace' Hits $200M Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The new ``Star Wars'' film topped the $200  
million mark in a record 13 days while ``Notting Hill'' took in 
$27.8 million with its mix of Julia Roberts and romance, according 
to industry estimates Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other new film in wide release, ``The Thirteenth  
Floor,'' opened in fifth place. The science fiction film noir had a 
disappointing $4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' topped the  
four-day Memorial Day holiday box office with $64.8 million, for a 
total gross of $205 million in less than two weeks. It took 
``Independence Day'' 30 days to reach the mark in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie's average ticket sales per screen were through the  
roof at $21,436, indicating packed houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie's like a thoroughbred. We put it on the track every  
day and it doesn't disappoint you,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution 
head for 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that hardcore fans have seen it, families are the key to the  
repeat business the movie will need to thrive as it faces the 
summer blockbuster season in a month or so, Sherak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, counterprogramming paid off big-time for ``Notting  
Hill.'' Its gross of $27.8 million was the best opening ever for a 
Julia Roberts movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Her comedy ``My Best Friend's Wedding'' opened with $21.7  
million over three days in 1997, while the comparable three-day 
figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million. ``Notting Hill'' was 
playing on about 600 more screens than ``Wedding'' and ticket 
prices are higher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are absolutely thrilled,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of  
distribution for Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Love Letter,'' also billed as a romantic alternative,  
tanked in its second week, dropping out of the Top 10 list with a 
meager gross of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason: ``The Love Letter'' starred Tom Selleck. ``Notting  
Hill'' had Ms. Roberts. Polled audiences said ``the main reason 
they came was for Julia Roberts and the second reason they came was 
for the romance,'' Ms. Rocco said. 
</P>
<P>
	She had no qualms about putting ``Notting Hill'' up against the  
second week of ``Star Wars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill  
ride'' fans, Ms. Rocco said, while the love story between Ms. 
Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British 
bookstore owner drew an older crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal's strategy to open ahead and behind of ``Star Wars''  
paid off. ``The Mummy,'' the studio's own thrill ride movie, was in 
third place with $12.7 million. It has grossed $117.1 million in 
four weeks. Playing on an enormous 3,395 screens, the movie take 
per theater was a respectable $3,741, although it was dwarfed by 
the $10,128 average for ``Notting Hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: (Final figures 
are to be released Tuesday.) 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $64.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Notting Hill,'' $27.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Mummy,'' $12.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Entrapment,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $4.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Matrix,'' $3.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $2.004  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Life,'' $1.4 million.

	10. ``Election,'' $1.38 million.

<HEADLINE> Lyme, Conn., Skeptical of Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYME, Conn. (AP) -- In the wooded enclave that gave Lyme disease  
its name, people are greeting a new vaccine with a dose of New 
England skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new LYMErix vaccine is going to be successful anywhere,  
Connecticut ought to be the place, since it has the nation's 
highest rate of the disease -- 105 cases per 100,000 people last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But five months after the vaccine came on the market, doctors  
said people aren't exactly lining up in Lyme disease country as 
summer approaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived here for years and years, and I think you'll find  
that most people who've lived here for years aren't that excited 
about it,'' said First Selectman Ralph F. Eno Jr., the top elected 
official in this town of 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Resident Polly Murray, who wrote ``The Widening Circle'' about  
her family's battle with the disease, said she fears the vaccine 
might aggravate her arthritis, a lingering effect of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are a little bit cautious,'' she said. ``It is a first  
vaccine. They haven't tested it for children and the elderly, and I 
think everybody has to decide for themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the reluctance may be the fact that the vaccine is  
administered in three doses over a year and offers no guarantee 
against being infected. 
</P>
<P>
	If caught early, Lyme disease, spread by a tiny bug called a  
deer tick, can be cured with antibiotics. But if it goes 
undiagnosed, as is often the case, it can cause arthritis, heart 
irregularities, facial paralysis and other disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine provides 50 percent protection after the first two  
doses and 78 percent protection after all three doses. Since it 
isn't known how long protection lasts, booster shots may be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the cost. LYMErix, marketed by SmithKline Beecham,  
costs about $150 for the course of injections. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Dr. Allen C. Steere, who first identified the disease in  
the 1970s and was the primary investigator on LYMErix, said he can 
understand why people might be hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, an area like Lyme, Connecticut, is an area where  
you would consider vaccination,'' said Steere, chief of 
rheumatology and immunology at the Tufts School of Medicine in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it really becomes a personal decision as to whether a  
person wants to take a preventative approach, or is thinking, `I've 
lived here 20 years and I've lived with this risk before,''' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steere has not been vaccinated himself, saying he is a city  
dweller who spends much of his time in a laboratory. But he 
recommends it for patients in high-risk areas who are often 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Vijay Sikand, a leading Lyme disease specialist from East  
Lyme who tested the vaccine, said part of the problem may lie with 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``As with anything that's new, patients and physicians need to  
be familiar with it before they reach a comfort level,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states have registered cases of the disease, but it is most  
prevalent in the Northeast, upper Midwest and Pacific coastal 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease came to Steere's attention in 1975 when mothers in  
Lyme, notably Murray, insisted there was an outbreak of arthritis 
in their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyme disease comes from bacteria carried by the deer tick. The  
ticks transmit the infection from animals like deer and mice to 
humans. Early symptoms include a rash, headache, fever, fatigue, 
joint and muscle aches and a stiff neck. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 128,000 cases have been reported in the United States  
since 1982. But with the range of symptoms so wide, it is often 
misdiagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved LYMErix for people  
ages 15 to 70. SmithKline Beecham spokesman Richard Koenig said 
demand for the vaccine -- about 200,000 units around the country -- 
has not been disappointing. The company has registered $18 million 
in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on target with our expectations to date,'' Koenig said.  
</P>
<P>
	But analyst Michael Krensavage of Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.  
says the revenues so far may result from an initial buildup of 
inventory, rather than a true gauge of sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody on Wall Street is expecting it to power SmithKline's  
earnings. It will be a small niche product,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Terrence W. Norchi, a specialist in internal medicine and an  
analyst with the Wall Street firm Sanford C. Bernstein, said there 
are still too many unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four or five years from now, if we see a decrease in the  
incidence of Lyme, then people may start lining up for it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, residents of Lyme are in no hurry, said Eno.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real small town,'' he said. ``People make up their own  
minds.''

<HEADLINE> Coles To Appear Before IOC Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Embattled Australian IOC member  
Phil Coles will appear before a special inquiry panel Thursday to 
provide ``personal explanations'' for conduct that could lead to 
his expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-member panel advised the IOC executive board Monday  
that it had drafted a list of questions for Coles to answer before 
it makes its final recommendation in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have decided what we shall ask Mr. Coles on Thursday  
morning,'' panel member Marc Hodler said. ``We need his personal 
explanations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has already received a severe warning from the IOC for  
accepting lavish travel and other benefits from Salt Lake bidders, 
and is now under investigation for further allegations of abusing 
his Olympic positions. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife has told the IOC that the couple received jewelry  
valued at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid 
for the 1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles also has been accused of compiling secret dossiers on IOC  
members for Sydney's successful 2000 bid. Those files were also 
passed on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	Hodler said the panel would report its findings to the executive  
board at its next meeting June 16 in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel could recommend that the case be dropped or that Coles  
be expelled. Any expulsion would have to go to the full IOC 
assembly for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to solve this problem as soon as possible, not only  
for us, but also for him and for Australia,'' IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian executive board member Kevan Gosper left the room  
Monday when Coles' case was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reasons are very simple,'' he said. ``I'm too close to Phil  
Coles as an IOC member in Australia to risk any perceptions of 
conflict of interest,'' he said. ``I have previously said I 
wouldn't participate in any vote on Phil Coles. Now I'm absenting 
myself from all matters.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins Sprint Double Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Maurice Greene has a cozy relationship going  
with the track at Hayward Field. He'll have a rival for its 
affections next month in Michael Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene won the 100 and 200 at the Prefontaine Classic on Sunday,  
sweeping the marquee sprint events for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this track loves me, and I love this track. I love  
this city,'' Greene said after his magnificent double thrilled the 
crowd of 12,247. ``We're going to have a lot of good times here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The good times roll next month, when Greene and Johnson are  
expected to compete in a 200 showdown at the USA Championships, the 
qualifying meet for the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	As world champion in the 100, Greene does not have to qualify in  
that event. Neither does Johnson in the 400, since he also is the 
world champion. Thus, both will concentrate on the 200 for the 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson easily won the 400 Sunday, and Marion Jones was dominant  
in the women's sprints. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pre also produced another outstanding mile, with 10 runners  
breaking the four-minute barrier, led by Kenya's Noah Ngeny. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 100 meters and the 1997  
world champion, won the 100 in 9.84 seconds, a time that equaled 
Canadian Donovan Bailey's world record but was negated by a wind of 
7.83 mph, well over the allowable of 4.473 for record purposes. The 
clocking has been bettered only six other times. ``Easy,'' was all 
he said when asked to describe the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty minutes later, Greene won the 200 in 20.06, a time that  
would have broken the meet record of 20.15 by Johnson in 1995, if 
not for the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, with slightly less wind, Greene ran even faster,  
winning the 100 in 9.79 and the 200 in 19.88. Still, the wind was 
over the limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 200 was a little challenging, because I was winded after  
the 100,'' Greene said. ``But I'm in good enough shape where I can 
go back-to-back like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, ranked No. 1 in the world in the 400 eight times, beat  
world No. 2 Mark Richardson of Britain by nearly 10 meters at 
44.51, matching his best time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind was blowing hard down the backstretch, so running a  
good time today was pretty much impossible,'' said Johnson, who 
said he thought he was in shape to break 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, track and field's woman athlete of the year the past two  
years, was competing for the first time in more than a month. But 
she won the 200 by about nine meters in 21.81, the fastest time in 
the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go through the season undefeated because I've yet to  
do that,'' said Jones, who lost only once last year, in her final 
competition of the season, in the long jump. 
</P>
<P>
	While the near-capacity crowd roared its approval for the  
sprinters, it saved its loudest cheers for the men's milers. 
</P>
<P>
	The milers went through a quarter-mile in 56:00, then the  
20-year-old Ngeny took the field through a 1:56.02 half-mile and 
was timed at 2:54.9 for three-quarters, before pulling away down 
the final straightway and winning at 3:52.09, the fastest mile in 
the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Kevin Sullivan, the former Michigan star, finished  
second at 3:53.70, and Adam Goucher, the 1999 national indoor 3,000 
champion and 1998 NCAA 5,000 winner for Colorado, was third at 
3:54.17. It was his career best and the best by an American this 
year. Americans Karl Paranya, fifth at 3:54.83, and Steve Holman, 
eighth at 3:55.13, also cracked the four-minute barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wade, who came into the meet as the world leader in the  
110 hurdles, lowered his best time to 13.12. Reggie Torian, the 
runner-up at 13.17, also went under Wade's previous leading time of 
13.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Wade said he held back a little off the blocks because of two  
false starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of threw me off a little bit, but after the third  
hurdle I got into the race and I started running,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-event program produced three other 1999 American leaders.  
</P>
<P>
	Regina Jacobs, a seven-time national champion, won the women's  
1,500 meters at 4:07.90. Lance Deal, the American record-holder in 
the hammer throw, won at 261 feet, 2 inches, and Bob Kennedy, the 
American record-holder at 5,000 meters, finished third at 13:18.83, 
behind Kenya's Luke Kipkosgei (13:17.15) and Mexico's Pablo Olmedo 
(13:18.21). 
</P>
<P>
	Deal, coming back from surgery last summer on his broken right  
foot, had the handle of his hammer break during his second throw. 
It cut his right index finger, but he was otherwise uninjured, and 
went on to overtake Kevin McMahon, who finished second with a 
personal-best 260 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nationals is going to be a dogfight,'' Deal said. ``It'll be  
fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were two other surprises. Lawrence Johnson, the former  
American record-holder in the pole vault, beat current 
record-holder Jeff Hartwig, 18-8 1/4 to 18-4 1/2, and Andy Bloom, the 
former NCAA shot put and discus champion from Wake Forest, beat 
1999 world leader John Godina, 220-0 to 217-8.

<HEADLINE> Organ-Rejection Remedy Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drugs designed to teach the body to accept  
transplanted organs have remained effective for up to a year in 
monkeys that received kidneys, according to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope the experimental treatment will one day free  
some transplant patients from having to take anti-rejection drugs 
for the rest of their lives. The standard drugs suppress the immune 
system and leave patients vulnerable to infections and tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers are planning studies of the experimental treatment  
in people, said Dr. Allan Kirk of the Naval Medical Research Center 
in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	He and co-authors describe the monkey study in the June issue of  
the journal Nature Medicine. Two years ago, Kirk and colleagues 
reported on a similar treatment that staved off rejection for more 
than nine months in monkeys. The new treatment includes only one of 
the two substances administered in the prior work. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to teach the immune system to accept the  
transplanted tissue rather than attack it. To do that, researchers 
injected the monkeys with a protein to prevent certain blood cells 
from delivering a ``danger'' signal to other cells, an initial 
event in rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	The protein is called hu5C8. The researchers gave it to nine  
monkeys the morning of the kidney transplant, just after the 
surgery, about once a week for four weeks after that, and finally 
once a month for five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of the nine treated monkeys remain alive and well with no  
organ rejection. Two have lived about a year so far since the end 
of treatment, and another more than six months. The ninth monkey 
died from an unrelated cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In a commentary accompanying the article, immune-system expert  
Polly Matzinger of the National Institutes of Health said a 1996 
study had shown the approach works in mice. But transplant 
researchers largely overlooked that report, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well,'' she wrote, ``it is time to pay attention!''

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Next for Trinidad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- More than six hours of negotiations  
earned Felix Trinidad Jr. an extra $500,000 and cleared the way for 
his welterweight unification fight against Oscar De La Hoya on 
Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King was happy with the deal that matches IBF  
champion Trinidad with De La Hoya, the WBC titleholder, at the new 
Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything turned out as we wished. In the end, we will  
present the match that all the world wants to see,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	If King was happy, Trinidad's father and manager, Felix Trinidad  
Sr., was less thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly I could have negotiated a better contract ... but it's  
the match that all the world wants to see and the time has come. 
It's past time for Tito to confront Oscar De La Hoya and knock him 
out to show for real who is the best,'' Trinidad Sr. said after the 
agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The final deal pays Trinidad $8.5 million and King $2 million.  
Trinidad also gets $300,000 for training costs and both men get an 
additional $4 each for every pay-per-view customer over 850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya will earn $15 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's negotiation provided an extra $500,000 for Trinidad  
over the original agreement and locks the Puerto Rican fighter into 
a share of what his father anticipates will be a record number of 
pay-per-view customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, 35-0, scored the 30th knockout of his career when he  
stopped Hugo Pineda on Saturday night. De La Hoya is 31-0 with 22 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, who lost 18 pounds over two months to reach the  
welterweight limit of 147 pounds for the Pineda fight, was 
confident after Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was an important triumph on the way to my greatest  
challenge,'' he said. ``This was a way for me to demonstrate to (De 
La Hoya) I'm ready for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya suffered a sprained hand when he defended his title  
May 24 against Oba Carr, but said he would have time to recuperate 
before getting into training to face Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get it on,'' De La Hoya said. ``It will be the fight of  
the century.''

<HEADLINE> Group Home in Pornography Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Marie likes to color, watch cartoons and  
play with animals. She uses pens scented with watermelon and 
blueberry, and hugs and squeezes her five cats. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old woman is clearly not interested in sex. But sex  
is the reason she may have to find a new home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Human Services plans to pull the license for  
the Jaricot Foster Home for mentally retarded adults unless Monique 
Dostie, who runs it, lifts her rules forbidding pornography and 
sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dostie is unrepentant in trying to shield her residents from  
``perversion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I teach them that it's wrong, that they don't need that (sex)  
to survive,'' said Ms. Dostie, a devout Roman Catholic who lives in 
the home. ``I teach them their faith and bring God into their 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case may ultimately be decided in the courts if she fails in  
her appeal to the state to keep her license. 
</P>
<P>
	State rules say people with mental retardation and autism in  
group homes have a right to participate in activities of choice, 
which include using pornographic material and sexual acts such as 
masturbation and consensual sex. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Ms. Dostie's three residents is complaining. In fact,  
some of their guardians chose the home because of its policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Nicholson of Coos Bay, Ore., said she would place her  
mentally retarded 24-year-old daughter in a sex-free environment if 
she could find one. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is you are dealing with a group of individuals who  
have a chronological age of an adult, but the maturation of a 3- to 
5-year-old. We would recognize that a 3- to 5-year-old is not 
capable of sex,'' she said. ``We would call it pedophilia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dostie said the developmentally disabled can't handle  
decisions of daily living, never mind the complex atmosphere of 
sexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Joni Fritz, executive director of the American Network of  
Community Options and Resources, which represents group homes, said 
Ms. Dostie is denying human sexuality by forbidding sex or 
masturbation. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, people who lived in institutions were told that  
they couldn't have sex and they were prohibited from masturbating. 
They would find ways to gratify themselves,'' Fritz said. 
``Sometimes prohibition of that kind of thing has led to an 
increase in deviate behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Decker, executive director of the National Association of  
Protection and Advocacy Systems for people with disabilities in 
Washington, said with fewer people institutionalized nationwide, it 
is important to make sure the biases of group home providers don't 
overtake individual choices. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not taking care of children. This is taking care of  
adults who have some cognitive deficiencies but who have a lot of 
abilities,'' Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Bendell, who is representing Ms. Dostie on behalf of the  
American Catholic Lawyers Association, says the state believes 
every group home must be the same, and makes no exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	He said such a ``cookie cutter approach'' is not in the best  
interest of all group home residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dostie said her residents could be placed in another home.  
</P>
<P>
	``But they don't want to,'' she said. ``They're not the ones  
asking for sex or pornography. It's the state that's mandating 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks Warned To Avoid Letdown  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The New York Knicks have played some of  
their best basketball in the first game of each of their three 
playoff series. Their Game 2s have been a different story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about staying hungry, but we talked about that in  
Miami and were down 23-15 at the quarter, and we said the same 
thing before Game 2 in Atlanta and were down 13-2,'' coach Jeff Van 
Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we've said all the right things, but we haven't done it  
yet. If we come out like we have in all the Game 2s, we're going 
home with a loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks seem to be sitting in the driver's seat heading into  
tonight's Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers will be trying to avoid falling into a 2-0 deficit  
that history has shown to be almost impossible to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Only seven teams have come back from such a deficit in a  
seven-game series, and only two, the 1994 Houston Rockets and 1969 
Los Angeles Lakers, made such a comeback after losing the first two 
games at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew this series was going to be a war. Now we have  
one,'' Indiana's Jalen Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was one of several players singled out for criticism by  
Indiana coach Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach was displeased that Rose got sucked into one-on-one  
confrontations with Latrell Sprewell. He also said Rik Smits will 
need to get involved earlier offensively, and Reggie Miller will 
have to avoid foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	What Bird was most upset with was his team's defense, especially  
in transition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks scored 22 points on fast breaks, capitalizing on the  
athleticism and quickness that has distinguished this year's 
version from past New York teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think that our strength is defensive transition,  
but it wasn't there,'' Smits said. ``We have to bust our tails and 
get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller called on his teammates to raise their games -- especially  
if the Knicks concentrate their defense on stopping the most famous 
Knicks killer of them all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to the other guys to take it personally,'' Miller  
said. ``We wouldn't have gotten this far if it wasn't for the 
contributions of everyone else. If they're going to go out and not 
let me get the last shot and not get my touches and make everyone 
else beat them, if I'm the other four guys on the court or the guys 
on the bench, I take it personal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practicing at Market Square Arena, the Pacers wore  
somewhat of a shellshocked look after having a night to digest what 
happened to them on their home floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 11-game winning streak, which included a seven-game  
unbeaten streak in the postseason, meant nothing to a Knicks team 
that led for most of the game and converted all the big plays down 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys for Indiana will be stopping Sprewell and Marcus  
Camby from changing the tempo of the game when New York's second 
unit is on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, the infusion of energy provided by Sprewell sparked  
the Knicks to an early 10-0 run that helped them stay in command 
for most of the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sprewell factor is one of the Knicks' new qualities that  
takes some getting used to, and the Pacers -- accustomed to seeing a 
New York offense centered around Patrick Ewing -- looked completely 
at a loss to find a way to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did a horrible job of getting back on defense, and that's  
all effort and desire,'' said Miller, who added that he expects the 
Knicks to be a little more laid-back in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that's what he thinks, that can be good for us,'' New  
York's Kurt Thomas said. ``We're not on cruise control. We realize 
how important every game is.''

<HEADLINE> Bird Imparts Basketball Wisdom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sprint back on defense. Move the ball on  
offense. Don't commit stupid fouls. Don't lose hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were the messages Larry Bird imparted to his team Monday,  
a day after the Pacers lost Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals 
to the New York Knicks. It was Indiana's first loss in more than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	``His main thing was to say that it's going to be a long  
series,'' Indiana's Dale Davis said. ``We have time, so put that 
game behind us and play the way we're capable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers wore somewhat of a shell-shocked look after having a  
night to digest what had happened to them on their home floor. 
Their 11-game wining streak, which included a seven-game unbeaten 
streak in the postseason, meant nothing to a Knicks team that led 
for most of the game and converted all the big plays down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was most upset with his team's defense, especially in  
transition. The Knicks scored 22 points on the fast break, 
capitalizing on the athleticism and quickness that has 
distinguished this year's version from past New York teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to think that our strength is defensive transition,  
but it wasn't there,'' Rik Smits said. ``We have to bust our tails 
and get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing they did was come in and really take it to us, and  
we didn't respond well,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams practiced at Market Square Arena in preparation for  
Game 2 on Tuesday night. The series shifts to New York for Game 3 
Saturday and Game 4 on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers want to avoid falling into a 2-0 deficit that has  
proved almost impossible to overcome. Only seven teams have come 
back from such a hole in a seven-game series. And only two, the 
1994 Houston Rockets and 1969 Los Angeles Lakers, made such a 
comeback after losing the first two games at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knew this series was going to be a war. Now we have  
one,'' Indiana's Jalen Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose was one member of the Pacers who took the brunt of the  
criticism from the coach. Bird was displeased that Rose got sucked 
at times into a one-on-one battle with Latrell Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird also said Smits will need to get involved earlier  
offensively and Miller will have to avoid the kind of foul trouble 
that sent him to the bench in the first half when the Knicks were 
unable to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, his task Monday was trying  
to get his team to avoid the kind of letdowns they had in Game 2 of 
the first and second rounds against Miami and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked about staying hungry, but we talked about that in  
Miami and were down 23-15 at the quarter, and we said the same 
thing before Game 2 in Atlanta and were down 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we've said all the right things, but we haven't done it  
yet. If we come out like we have in all the Game 2s, we're going 
home with a loss,'' Van Gundy said. ``The quality of competition is 
much improved in this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the keys for Indiana will be stopping Sprewell and Marcus  
Camby from changing the tempo when New York's second unit is on the 
court. In Game 1, the infusion of energy provided by Sprewell 
sparked the Knicks to an early 10-0 run that helped them stay in

<HEADLINE>  Corey Quits As Canadiens President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Ronald Corey said on Monday he is stepping down  
as president of the Montreal Canadiens Monday, six weeks after 
hockey's most storied franchise finished last in its division and 
out of the NHL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Seventeen years in charge of the Montreal Canadiens is  
enough,'' Corey told a news conference. ``It takes quite a man to 
do 17 years in Montreal, as (NHL commissioner) Gary Bettman told me 
this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corey, 60, said it was time for a ``more relaxing life.'' His  
resignation takes effect July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey became president of the Canadiens in 1982 and the team won  
Stanley Cups in 1986 and 1993. But Montreal finished out of the 
playoffs this season for the second time in five years with a 
32-39-11 record, 11th in the Eastern Conference and with their 
lowest points total (not counting the lockout-shortened season) 
since 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
	``While hockey may be going through some tough times, I have no  
doubt that the Montreal Canadiens' dynasty will continue to thrive 
and that Montrealers will see many more Stanley Cups in the years 
ahead,'' Corey said. 
</P>
<P>
	James Arnett, president and chief executive officer of Molson,  
said Corey had approached him about a month ago about leaving. An 
executive search firm has been hired to conduct a search for the 
successor to Corey and the club hopes a new president will be in 
place before next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's always done big things for the Canadiens and within four  
years he brought the Canadiens a Stanley Cup,'' said Eric Molson, 
chairman of the board of directors of Molson, which owns the Molson 
Centre and the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could not have given us a bigger gift when in '93 he  
completed our case of 24 Stanley Cups. He's not only a great man 
and an important figure, but a great member of the community in 
Quebec and Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corey was heavily involved in the move from the Montreal Forum  
to the Molson Centre in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the driving force behind both the concept and the  
construction of the Molson Centre, a project that he managed from 
beginning to end,'' said Molson. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who described his relationship with Corey as cordial,  
thanked Corey for all his efforts on behalf of the club. So did 
Molson, who seemed genuinely moved by the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey paid tribute to colleagues, players and fans, and made a  
point of thanking Bettman for helping organize the Maurice Richard 
Trophy to reward the league's top goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also noted that Canadian clubs are working at a  
disadvantage because of the devalued Canadian dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not working the same environment,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Corey said his love for the game had not changed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I still enjoy every second of it,'' he said. Referring to the  
playoffs, he said ``that type of hockey will be back in Montreal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he took time to thank the many fans of the Canadiens, whom  
he called Canada's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere we have fans,'' he said. ``So many fans, always  
encouraging us and I want to thank them, all over the country.''

<HEADLINE> Most Horses Don't Win Triple Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The difference has been as short as a nose or as  
long as 15 lengths, but the result was the same -- a Triple Crown 
bid spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five horses have won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness,  
with 11 going on to racing immortality. Fourteen joined the 
bittersweet list of near misses by failing to win the final leg of 
the series, the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no asterisk next to the winners in the charts of those  
14 Belmonts, noting a Triple Crown bid was foiled in the process. 
And there won't be one Saturday should any one of about a dozen 
challengers upend Charismatic as he tries to become the first 
Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	But should the winner be anyone other than Charismatic, the  
mantle of spoiler will fall across his shoulders as surely as the 
blanket of white carnations. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Chris McCarron played the part of spoiler when he  
guided Touch Gold past Silver Charm in the final 50 yards to win 
the Belmont by three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't consciously assume the role of trying to be a  
spoiler. My job was to get the best out of my mount. I was painted 
as a spoiler after the fact,'' McCarron said. ``I felt like I was 
just doing my job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I received hate mail. `How dare you? Racing hasn't had a  
Triple Crown winner in 20-some years. How could you do this?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Like McCarron, those who have been involved in the end of a  
Triple Crown run don't look at it that way -- they were just trying 
to win one of the most prestigious and richest horse races in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years before Secretariat's magical run through the classics  
in 1973, another hugely popular horse, Canonero II, was poised for 
a shot at the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Blum, now a racing steward in Florida, was aboard 35-1  
shot Pass Catcher when he upended the Triple Crown bid of the pride 
of Venezuela before a record crowd of 82,694 at Belmont Park. Just 
a week earlier, Pass Catcher had run a strong second to Bold 
Reasoning in the Jersey Derby, and Blum knew his horse was ready 
for an upset. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone was looking for a Triple Crown but me,'' Blum  
recalled. ``I think all of Venezuela turned out at Belmont that 
day, waving flags and cheering for Canonero. It was a great scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ever remember being called a spoiler, but if that's  
what they want to call me now, fine. My job was to go out there and 
win the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's 131st running of the Belmont, Charismatic becomes  
the 26th horse with a chance to win the Triple Crown. Since 
Affirmed's '78 Triple Crown, the year after Seattle Slew won it, 
six horses have won the Derby and Preakness, but flopped in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	The past three times, the horse bidding for the Triple Crown  
finished second. In 1989, Sunday Silence was 8 lengths behind rival 
Easy Goer; and the last two Belmonts saw Bob Baffert-trained colts 
fall just short of racing immortality -- Silver Charm was edged by 
Touch Gold and Real Quiet was nosed out by Victory Gallop in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1961, Carry Back finished seventh in his Triple Crown bid, 15  
lengths behind the winner, Sherluck. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas saddles  
Charismatic knowing spoilers are lurking everywhere, from the star 
filly Silverbulletday in Baffert's barn, to Derby and Preakness 
runner-up Menifee to the Allen Jerkens-trained Best of Luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Wayne does not like the fact that I'm going to run  
her, but if it was me going for the Triple Crown, you'd see five 
Lukas horses in there,'' Baffert said. ``As a trainer last year, I 
was hoping everybody would stay home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert finds himself in a unique situation for this Belmont.  
Bob and Beverly Lewis own Silver Charm and Charismatic, and there 
was talk the trainer might keep Silverbulletday out of the Belmont 
to give the Lewises a better shot at winning the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't do anything like that. We just want to win the  
Belmont, it's not about spoiling,'' Baffert said, the ``we'' 
including Silverbulletday's owner Mike Pegram. ``I've told Bob 
Lewis we're not trying to spoil your deal. The Triple Crown is made 
so if you are the best you shouldn't worry about anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Bob Lewis welcomes all challengers.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted to see a full field because, if we win, then  
there will be no one on Sunday morning saying we didn't beat much 
of a field,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several jockeys have been involved on both sides of the Triple  
Crown chase, notably McCarron and Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron's Triple Crown dreams aboard Alysheba in 1987 were  
foiled by Bet Twice, ridden by Craig Perret. Ten years later, 
McCarron played spoiler aboard Touch Gold, beating out Stevens, who 
was on Silver Charm. Last year, Stevens spoiled Real Quiet's Triple 
Crown bid with his win aboard Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a great responsibility to my betting public, the  
owners I'm riding for and the trainer,'' McCarron said. ``I 
wouldn't be doing my job if I did anything less than try to win 100 
percent of the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Day, who will be aboard Menifee in Saturday's Belmont, gets  
his second chance to play spoiler -- he was aboard Easy Goer in the 
'89 Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of stopping a Triple Crown was not forefront in my  
mind,'' said Day, even though Easy Goer was second to Sunday 
Silence in the Derby and Preakness, just like Menifee has been to 
Charismatic this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to win the race because I contended all along  
that Easy Goer was the better horse. He was sent over in good form, 
and we got the victory very handily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What about Saturday?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure (trainer) Elliott Walden will get Menifee up to the  
race and give him an opportunity,'' Day said, ``and Lord willing,

<HEADLINE> IOC Takes Steps on Path to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Six months after the Olympic  
corruption scandal broke, the IOC sets out this week on a path of 
reform that could reshape the 105-year-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A special task force, whose members include Henry Kissinger and  
Peter Ueberroth, meets for the first time Tuesday to begin 
rebuilding the International Olympic Committee after its worst 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Convinced the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and its aftershocks  
are finally behind them, IOC leaders are now taking the first 
concrete steps toward the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meeting is only the beginning,'' IOC president Juan  
Antonio Samaranch said in an interview Monday. ``We cannot expect 
any kind of resolution this week. Our aim is to have final 
decisions by the end of the year. If that's not possible, then by 
the spring of next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the reforms would not be dictated by pressure  
from Arizona Sen. John McCain and other congressional critics who 
have threatened to enact legislation that would punish the IOC 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can do what they desire,'' Samaranch said. ``But I  
repeat: The IOC is run by the IOC members. ... We highly respect 
the Senate of the United States, but I am sure they also will 
respect the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled in March and four resigned after  
being accused of receiving cash or other improper inducements 
during Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC ethics commission, formed after the Salt Lake scandal,  
met last week and drafted a conduct code for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the reform commission -- called IOC 2000 -- will begin  
examining ways of overhauling the IOC's structure and the way host 
cities are chosen, including a radical suggestion to abolish the 
bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally planned as a group of 20-24 people, the commission  
has expanded to 80 members -- 44 from the IOC and 36 from outside. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders have rejected critics' complaints that the body,  
chaired by Samaranch, is too large to work effectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more people participating in the decision process, the  
more likely the reforms will pass in the general assembly,'' IOC 
board member Jacques Rogge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is divided into three groups: the composition and  
structure of the IOC, the role of the IOC, and the selection of 
host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel examining the IOC structure, viewed as the most  
significant group, is chaired by Italian IOC member and former Rome 
Mayor Franco Carraro. 
</P>
<P>
	German executive board member Thomas Bach leads the group  
dealing with the IOC's role, while American IOC vice president 
Anita DeFrantz runs the panel on site selection. 
</P>
<P>
	A 26-member executive committee, divided equally among IOC and  
non-IOC members, will be appointed Tuesday to oversee the reform 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most prominent names of non-IOC members on the  
commission are Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State; 
Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games; Italian 
industrialist Giovanni Agnelli; former U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt; NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol; and 
Nobel Peace Price winner and former Costa Rica president Oscar 
Arias Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the  
next IOC general assembly in Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Final recommendations are to be prepared by the end of October,  
submitted to all IOC members for review in November and adopted at 
a general assembly in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the reforms expected to be considered are changes in the  
way the IOC chooses its members, including new age limits and 
possible term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC's traditional system of membership for almost life terms  
is expected to be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the IOC raised its age limit from 75 to 80 to allow  
Samaranch to gain another term as president. Now, the IOC is 
expected to consider reducing the limit to as low as 70. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the scandal, the IOC has imposed restrictions on  
the bidding and selection process for the 2006 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members are banned from inspecting the candidate cities and  
bid officials are forbidden from visiting IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel will reduce the field of six European cities to two  
finalists in Seoul on June 19. On the same day, the full assembly 
will choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said the IOC commission should consider scrapping the  
bid process and let the IOC decide where it wants to stage the 
games and negotiate directly with that city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could say, `We really want the games in city X,' and see  
what would they need, what it would cost,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Remains May Belong to Rock Musician </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Human remains found inside the wreckage of  
a minivan that plunged down a 200-foot ravine may be those of a 
rock musician missing since 1995, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1993 Ford Aerostar matches the description of a van driven  
by onetime Iron Butterfly bass player Philip ``Taylor'' Kramer, who 
was believed to be driving his van when he disappeared Feb. 12, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were being examined by coroner's investigators  
Sunday, authorities said. No identity has been released. 
</P>
<P>
	A hiker in the ravine discovered the skeleton late Saturday but  
investigators were not able to recover the vehicle until daylight, 
said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Bruce Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The ravine is located below a curving, two-lane road that is a  
popular dumping ground for stolen cars, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not yet clear whether the driver died when the car went  
off the side of the road or whether foul play was involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, who was 42 when he disappeared, was last seen leaving  
his Thousand Oaks-area home to pick up a friend at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined a re-formed Iron Butterfly in 1975 as a singer and  
bass player. The band, best known for the 17-minute 
``In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida'' in 1969, had several incarnations with 
various band members over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer went on to work in aerospace and later became involved in  
interactive media. At the time of his disappearance, he was chief 
technology officer at Total Multimedia in suburban Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
	After he disappeared, his wife, Jennifer, said her husband  
``would never, for any reason or under any circumstances, allow 
himself to completely abandon the family he loves more than life 
itself.''

<HEADLINE> Umpires Use TV Replay for Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An umpiring crew twice changed its call Monday on a  
line drive off the scoreboard by the Florida Marlins' Cliff Floyd, 
consulting television replays before finally ruling the hit a 
double rather than a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida played the game under protest after the ruling cost them  
a run in the fifth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd claimed his hit was a homer, saying it bounced off the  
wall behind the scoreboard. Second-base umpire Greg Gibson at first 
called the hit a double, but after Floyd began to argue, the 
umpiring crew conferred briefly and changed the ruling to a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals then began to argue, and the game was delayed for  
more than five minutes while crew chief Frank Pulli and home-plate 
umpire Greg Bonin studied replays on a TV camera near the Marlins' 
dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	When the replays showed the ball hit about two feet below the  
top of the scoreboard, the call was changed back to a double. Floyd 
ended the inning stranded at third.

<HEADLINE> River Bay Wins Whittingham Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- River Bay, who finished second in the  
Memorial Day feature at Hollywood Park last year, moved up a notch 
Monday and became a millionaire in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Bobby Frankel, River Bay came from well off the pace  
to take the lead midway through the stretch and won the inaugural 
Charles Whittingham Handicap by a half-length over Majorien. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis and carrying high weight of 119 pounds,  
River Bay covered 1 1/4 miles on turf in 2:00 3-5 and paid $13.40, 
$5.40 and $3.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The win in the $400,000 race snapped a five-race losing streak  
for River Bay and was the eighth win in 19 lifetime starts for the 
6-year-old Kentucky-bred son of Irish River. 
</P>
<P>
	It was worth $240,000, raising River Bay's career earnings to  
$1,117,490. 
</P>
<P>
	River Bay finished behind Storm Trooper last year when the Grade  
I race was known as the Hollywood Turf Handicap. It was renamed for 
the Hall of Fame trainer who died of leukemia April 20 -- one week 
after his 86th birthday. Whittingham-trained horses won the event 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	River Bay hadn't won since last July 19, when he captured the  
Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park in his first start following the 
Turf Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he had finished out of the money in his last three  
starts -- most recently on Feb. 15 when he finished fourth in the 
San Luis Obispo Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bobby Frankel has just done a great job with this horse, he's  
gotten the horse back to being himself,'' Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just wasn't right when I ran him at Santa Anita,'' Frankel  
said. ``He ran really well today. I think he just likes this race 
track. He's run four times on it now, he's won three, and he 
finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he acts like a bad boy, he usually runs his best race.  
And he was acting bad today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Majorien, ridden by Kent Desormeaux and carrying 117 pounds,  
crossed the finish line a neck in front of Alvo Certo and returned 
$3.20 and $2.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvo Certo, ridden by G.F. Almeida and carrying 115 pounds, was  
two lengths ahead of Astarabad at the wire and paid $3.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Astarabad across the finish line in the 31st running  
of the race for 3-year-olds and up were Magellan, Shelter Cove, 
Star Performance, Ward Hunt and Special Quest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $208,400 Milady Breeders' Cup Handicap on Monday, Gourmet  
Girl took the lead entering the final turn in beating 11-1 longshot 
Yolo Lady by two lengths. Even-money favorite Victory Stripes 
finished third in the field of five. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 115 pounds, Gourmet  
Girl covered 1 1-16 miles in 1:40 4-5 and paid $11.20, $6 and 
$2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the sixth in 15 lifetime starts for Gourmet Girl and  
was worth $112,440, raising the career earnings of the 4-year-old 
California-bred daughter of Cee's Tizzy to $484,808. 
</P>
<P>
	Gourmet Girl provided trainer A. Pico Perdomo with his first  
stakes victory since Stalwart Charger won the 1990 Affirmed 
Handicap, and just his third overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Yolo Lady, ridden by Solis and carrying 115 pounds, crossed the  
finish line 1 3/4 lengths ahead of Victory Stripes and returned $9 and 
$2.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Stripes, ridden by Chris McCarron and carrying 117  
pounds, was four lengths ahead of Keeper Hill at the wire and paid 
$2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lady From Dixie finished last in the 48th running of the Grade  
I race for fillies and mares. Bountiful Dreamer, Bella Chiarra and 
Cris The Swimmer were scratched. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Love That Red beat 2-5 favorite Apremont by  
three lengths in the $85,828 Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes -- also 
named for a Hall of Fame trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Garrett Gomez and carrying 122 pounds, Love That Red  
covered seven furlongs in 1:20 4-5 and paid $8.80 and $2.60. 
Because only four horses competed in the race for 3-year-olds, 
there was no show betting. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the fourth in eight lifetime starts for Love That  
Red and was worth $56,910, raising the career earnings of the 
Leonard Duncan-trained gelding to $221,049. 
</P>
<P>
	Delahoussaye was aboard four winners on Monday's 10-race card.

<HEADLINE> Schilling Is Complete Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In the era of long balls and sore arms, Curt  
Schilling is making a case for baseball to evolve. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe those in charge of the game should call an emergency  
meeting to fix a glaring oversight in the way stats are kept. The 
first order of business: Finding a new name for the complete game. 
</P>
<P>
	How about a ``Schilling?''  
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Phillies' ace is unique in this era of  
five-inning starters and career-ending arm injuries. The sheer 
amazement inspired by his five consecutive complete games says a 
lot about how much baseball has changed. 
</P>
<P>
	It also speaks volumes about Schilling's quest to return the  
game to its simple, utterly pure roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do know that I run into a lot more guys that have a smile on  
their face when get pulled after six innings winning 4-1 than guys 
that are angry,'' Schilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Schilling lived up to his menacing aura with a  
four-hit shutout for his fifth consecutive complete game Friday 
night. He has six complete games this season, not only leading the 
majors individually but surpassing every other team in both 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we have no intention of ever letting him go,'' said  
Phillies manager Terry Francona. ``That's why teams are clamoring 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling (8-2) did more than pitch his first shutout of the  
season and 13th of his career in the Phillies' 2-0 victory over 
Colorado. He did so by blowing away Larry Walker, Dante Bichette 
and Vinny Castilla in the ninth inning with pitches approaching 100 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	After striking out Walker with a 96-mph fastball and winning a  
13-pitch battle with Bichette with a 98-mph heater, Schilling 
struck out Castilla on three pitches. The last one was a merciless 
93-mph splitter, his 135th of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for pitch counts.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a ton left,'' Schilling said. ``I try to reach back in  
the ninth inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling's remarkable adrenaline rush came less than a week  
after the worst ninth-inning collapse of his career. Last Sunday, 
in New York, Schilling inexplicably squandered a 4-0 lead in a 5-4 
loss to the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it motivated me,'' said Schilling, who struck out nine  
and walked one. ``How could it not? To lose a game like that all by 
yourself is tough. It was a tough five days for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francona took some heat for leaving Schilling on the mound in  
the ninth against the Mets. John Olerud completed New York's 
comeback with a game-winning single on Schilling's 138th pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitch counts, for the most part, are incredibly overrated,''  
Schilling said. ``I've thrown 100 pitches and felt like it was 150 
because I made the 10 toughest pitches at the end. You have to fail 
to figure out how to do it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling made those comments nearly two weeks ago in a national  
conference call which he also used as a forum to blast Phillies 
ownership for its thriftiness. Not everything about him is old 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies, 24-24 after losing to the Rockies on Sunday,  
entered the season with a $30.36 million payroll that was the 
fourth-lowest in the National League. Schilling urged the team to 
spend more money or take their pick between trading him and selling 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Goaded to expound after his latest masterpiece, Schilling  
refused. All he would say was, ``This is a great baseball town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling's frequent squabbles with management don't interfere  
with the throwback persona he's crafted on the mound. Few 
contemporaries share his zeal for completing games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the days of knickers and mitten-like gloves, complete games  
were the rule. ``Old Hoss'' Radbourn completed all 73 of his starts 
in 1884, going 60-12 with a 1.38 ERA at a time when home runs were 
almost as unheard of as helmet cams. 
</P>
<P>
	In the modern era, the Phillies' Robin Roberts pitched 28  
straight complete games in 1953 and finished the season with 33. 
Steve Carlton's career-high was 30 in 1972, that awesome season in 
which he had 27 of the Phillies' 59 victories. 
</P>
<P>
	How times have changed. Schilling led the NL with 15 complete  
games last season, and Baltimore's Scott Erickson led the AL with 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something you teach,'' Schilling said. ```It's  
something you're raised with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other pitchers this decade have had five consecutive  
complete games -- Pat Hentgen for Toronto in 1996 and Philadelphia's 
Tommy Greene in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Schilling goes for his sixth straight complete game on Thursday  
afternoon against the Giants, something no one else has done this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll expect nothing less.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Police Shoot Homeless Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Every day Margaret Mitchell pushed her  
grocery cart up trendy La Brea Avenue, passing expensive antique 
shops and en-vogue restaurants, looking for all the world like she 
was going somewhere important. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-year-old mentally ill woman didn't really have any  
appointments. She didn't even have a home. But she was a fixture on 
this thoroughfare where a cup of coffee costs $3.50 and doorknobs 
sell for $50. 
</P>
<P>
	She was well-groomed, didn't panhandle and rarely spoke, say  
those who knew her. When merchants tried to give her food, she 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mitchell no longer strolls along La Brea. On May 21, after  
living on this street for more than a year, she was shot to death 
by a bicycle policeman new to the beat. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Larrigan, 27, and his partner, Kathy Clark, 29, had asked  
if Mrs. Mitchell's cart was stolen. Larrigan, with five years' 
experience under his gun belt, said he felt his life was threatened 
when the 5-foot-1 woman thrust a screwdriver at him. 
</P>
<P>
	He jumped to avoid her, fell to one knee and fired one shot into  
her chest, police said. She died at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, the Police Commission and the LAPD are separately  
investigating an incident that has taken on racial overtones. Mrs. 
Mitchell was black; Larrigan is Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Police Chief Bernard Parks said the officers  
appeared to have done nothing wrong, and he blasted accusations of 
bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to carry the burden of racism in the country  
of the United States for the last 200 years and place it on those 
officers' shoulders,'' said Parks, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for the homeless and the mentally ill also are using  
Mrs. Mitchell's death as an emblem for their causes. And on La 
Brea, white and black merchants who knew Mrs. Mitchell are 
incensed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all horrified. It's just so stupid,'' said Avril  
Clinch, as she wept inside her employer's antique shop. ``That 
woman never did any harm to anyone. And she gets shot to death over 
a shopping cart?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philippe Tie, her colleague at Chateau de la Companie, said he  
saw the woman every morning. ``At first, I didn't even know she was 
homeless,'' he said. ``She was clean. She wore a different outfit 
every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watching her stride down the street, head bent, ``she looked  
like she always had a purpose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next door, at the popular La Brea Bakery, manager Lora Davis saw  
Mrs. Mitchell the morning she died. Usually, the woman slept on the 
sidewalk or the bus bench fronting a nearby phone company office. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was talking to herself,'' Davis said. ``That was the first  
time I'd ever heard her speak.'' At closing time, Davis and her 
employees often stand at the back door and give away leftover 
bread. Mrs. Mitchell never came. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never asked for anything,'' Davis said. ``It's just so  
frightening to think that anyone would get shot over waving a 
screwdriver. None of it makes sense to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Parks said witnesses substantiate Larrigan's assertion  
that Mrs. Mitchell lunged at him. Attorney Leo Terrell, who 
represents son Richard Mitchell, said there are several witnesses 
who say the woman posed no threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Mitchell has said that his mother was a college-educated  
former bank employee whose mental health began deteriorating over 
the past few years. She heard voices, her son said, but refused 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	She lived off-and-on with him and his wife until about a year  
ago, he said. Under state law, a person cannot be unwillingly 
institutionalized unless they pose a threat to themselves or 
others. His mother was not violent, Mitchell said. But he was 
frustrated at not being able to force her into treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasingly paranoid, she preferred the street.  
</P>
<P>
	Shaun Pepper inhabits the same stretch of La Brea that Mrs.  
Mitchell did. He usually saw her twice a day, he said, but it took 
months to get the subdued woman to smile at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a refined lady. She never bothered no one,'' said  
Pepper, sitting on the corner of Fourth Street, where a shrine of 
flowers, candles and a shopping cart mark the intersection where 
she died on a Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pepper didn't see Mrs. Mitchell on any given day, he went out  
looking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Females are not the weaker sex,'' he said. ``But they really  
are preyed on out here on the streets. We watch out for each 
other.''

<HEADLINE> Study Backs Lower Doses of Hormones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Women can use lower doses of the replacement  
hormones taken to prevent postmenopausal bone loss and achieve the 
same benefits with reduced side effects, at least if they take 
calcium and Vitamin D along with the hormones, according to a new 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	With a lower dosage, side effects such as weight gain, breast  
tenderness, spotting, pelvic discomfort and mood changes are slight 
to begin with and disappear within six months, according to the 
study funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in 
Tuesday's Annals of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Those findings could allow many more women to benefit from the  
ability of hormones to prevent the low bone mass, or osteoporosis, 
that leaves millions of elderly women at risk of fractures, chronic 
pain and stooped posture. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the side effects, only about 20 percent of the women  
who could benefit currently take advantage of hormone replacement, 
said the study's authors from the Osteoporosis Research Center at 
Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower hormone dose also may reduce the risk of breast cancer  
associated with estrogen-containing supplements, though the study 
did not examine that risk, said one of the investigators, Dr. 
Robert P. Heaney. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved 128 women over age 65 with low bone mass.  
They received either a placebo or 0.3 milligrams of CCEE 
(continuous conjugated equine estrogen) and 2.5 milligrams of 
progesterone daily for 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The women, who also received calcium and vitamin D supplements,  
showed a 3.5 percent to 5.2 percent increase in spinal bone density 
as well as increases in total body and forearm bone density, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the lowest dose of estrogen considered effective in  
preventing bone loss was 0.625 milligrams a day. The calcium and 
vitamin D supplements apparently were the key to the success of the 
lower dosages, Heaney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have belatedly come to realize that most women in that age  
group are deficient in calcium and vitamin D,'' he said. ``We 
actually got a higher response with this low dose with calcium and 
vitamin D supplements than with the 0.625 milligram dosage without 
the supplements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If bone cells are to grow, they need materials, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can only do so much by flogging the workers. That is what  
the estrogen does to the bone cells. You have got to provide some 
bricks for them to build with,'' Heaney said. ``Many of us in the 
medical community have ignored the need to provide an adequate 
number of building blocks.''

	New Offer in Union-Car Hauler Talks  
</P>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Less than an hour before a strike  
deadline, company negotiators submitted a new economic offer late 
Monday to try to head off a strike by Teamsters against companies 
that haul new cars from factories to showrooms. Teamster Chip Ross 
said the union was reviewing the offer, but gave no further 
details. A union source described the new offers as 
``comprehensive'' and that it likely would take time beyond the 
12:02 a.m. EDT Tuesday strike deadline to fully evaluate it. No

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia's Balkans envoy Viktor  
Chernomyrdin announced plans to travel to Germany tomorrow for more 
talks on the crisis in Kosovo. He was to meet in Bonn with U.S. 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Finnish President 
Martti Ahtisaari, a spokesman said. On Wednesday they are expected 
to fly to Belgrade for more talks with Milosevic, according to 
Chernomyrdin and German officials. The Yugoslav government 
reiterated Monday that it accepts principles set forth by the Group 
of Eight major powers for ending the Kosovo conflict. But 
Milosevic's latest statement still fell short of Western demands 
for the makeup of a peacekeeping force in Kosovo.

playoff victory gives them a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference 
finals. The best-of-7 series resumes Friday at Portland's Rose 
Garden. Tim Duncan had 23 points, 10 rebounds and five blocked 
shots for the Spurs. Arvydas Sabonis led the Blazers with 17.

<HEADLINE> Portland Dejected Following Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers dominated the San  
Antonio Spurs for 47 minutes, 51 seconds before everything came 
crashing down with Sean Elliott's off-balance, game-winning 
3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	After enjoying an 18-point lead, and appearing as though they  
were headed to a victory on San Antonio's home court, the Blazers 
watched their lead evaporate today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs edged closer as the clock ran down and finished the  
game with a 10-3 run capped by Elliott's bomb from the sideline as 
Portland's Rasheed Wallace surged toward him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That last shot by Sean Elliott was incredible,'' Blazers coach  
Mike Dunleavy said. ``I'd give him a hundred bucks to see him make 
that shot again. It was one of those shots you dream about 
making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs took their only lead of the game on Elliott's sixth  
3-pointer and won 86-85 to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 3 is Friday at Portland's Rose Garden.  
</P>
<P>
	Though most Blazers-Spurs games this season have been close,  
Dunleavy described Monday's outcome as ``gut-wrenching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dejected Isaiah Rider said: ``We choked. We choked.''  
</P>
<P>
	``This was our game. We should have won it,'' added Blazers  
forward Brian Grant. ``It just hurts right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said the hard-fought game was typical  
of the teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was like every game we've had with Portland all year. It  
was a war,'' he said. ``We go after each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Jackson and Walt Williams both missed shots in the final  
seconds for Portland. Jackson tried to take it to the basket and 
draw contact but was forced into a short jumper. No foul was 
called. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely got the look I wanted,'' Jackson said. ``If the  
ref doesn't call it, no matter what I think, it wasn't a foul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams then missed with the rebound.  
</P>
<P>
	The Trail Blazers came out strong and led 31-20 after the first  
quarter and 48-34 at halftime. Portland upped its lead to 52-34 
early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	But then the Spurs went to work chipping away. A 14-0 run midway  
through the third quarter took a big chunk out of the lead and 
pulled the Spurs within 56-51. But the Blazers kept holding San 
Antonio back and led 67-60 entering the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely disappointing,'' Portland guard Greg Anthony  
said. ``This was possibly a gift, but that's basketball. Our guys 
battled, but they came out with the plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant said losing the large lead was where the Blazers lost the  
game, not simply on Elliott's huge shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a big lead. They cut it. That's where the game was  
lost,'' he said. ``We just didn't close it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers can only hope to put the devastating defeat behind  
them as the series shifts to Portland. They'll have until Friday to 
try and do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have the upper hand on us,'' Anthony said. ``We'll  
see them on Friday.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Vacation Spending Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coleman Hart wanted to reward his wife for  
finishing school, so he planned a winter cruise in the Caribbean 
and expects to spend more on their vacation than usual. But he only 
plans to spend a week away from work. 
</P>
<P>
	Short vacations are the style for almost two-thirds of Americans  
these days, even though most people expect to spend as much or more 
money on vacations than they spent last year, an Associated Press 
poll found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I manage an office and it is difficult to take more than one  
week at a time,'' said Hart, a 51-year-old insurance adjuster from 
Cape Coral, Fla. ``I steal a day and make a long weekend to travel 
or get out on holiday weekends like Memorial Day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart is not alone in preferring shorter vacations and in  
expecting to spend more money, said the poll, conducted for the AP 
by ICR of Media, Pa. The survey, taken May 21-25 among 1,008 
adults, carried a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	About six out of 10 interviewed said they expect to spend as  
much on getaways as they spent a year ago. And nearly one-fourth 
said they expect to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We bought a house a couple of years ago,'' said Chris Hughes,  
a Bristol, Tenn., mother of four with another child on the way. 
``It seems like the finances are better for a trip this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She and her family plan a 10-day trip to Gatlinburg, a Smoky  
Mountain resort on the eastern tip of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like traveling by car,'' Ms. Hughes said. ``We have a van  
and it's comfortable for everybody. We like to see the 
countryside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy was a big factor for Darroll Dawkins, a  
20-year-old college student from New York City, who plans to fly to 
Jamaica in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Money isn't that much of a problem; it's been a good year with  
the economy,'' he said. ``Being able to save money made a lot of 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The typical American likes to go on vacation in the summer,  
travel by car and spend a week or less on their trip, according to 
the poll. Nearly two-thirds of participants said they expect their 
longest vacation this year to last a week or less. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-quarter said they would spend less than $500 on  
vacation and four out of 10 said they would spend between $500 and 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Summer travelers will spend an average of $213 a day for a  
family of four, according to estimates from the AAA travel service, 
up $3 a day from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the poll:  
</P>
<P>
	--About half of those questioned said they prefer to travel in  
the summer, while almost one-fourth said fall and one out of six 
said spring. Winter was the choice of 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--A majority of adults between ages 18 and 55 prefer summer  
trips. For those from 55 to 64, fall was almost as popular as 
summer. For those 65 and older, spring and fall were more popular 
for vacations than summer. 
</P>
<P>
	--The percentage of people taking three-week vacations increases  
steadily as they get older. 
</P>
<P>
	--Driving, 55 percent, was the most popular mode of vacation  
travel, followed by flying at 30 percent, bus travel at 3 percent, 
cruises at 3 percent and train travel at 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only those who made $50,000 or more preferred to fly as much as  
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline prices have increased in recent months, but travel  
industry officials say they don't expect that to have an impact on 
the vacation season. 
</P>
<P>
	And they expect a very busy summer vacation season, because of  
the strong economy, low unemployment and consumer confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a big year,'' said Jack Mannix, managing  
director of travel-related services for AAA. ``There's almost a 
sense of entitlement about vacations. They feel like it's a 
learning experience, time to be with family, time to rest and 
recharge batteries.''

<HEADLINE> Ballpark Dining Goes Upscale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hot dogs and popcorn just won't cut the mustard  
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	With baseball salaries soaring and teams looking to pack  
skyboxes with upscale fans, the ballpark menu is getting a new 
look. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Larry Levy, a Chicago entrepreneur. Instead of ``Buy me  
some peanuts and Cracker Jack,'' he has fans humming a different 
tune. More like, ``Serve me some sushi and Chardonnay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levy's company, Levy Restaurants Sports &AMP; Entertainment Group,  
provides food service to skyboxes and clubs for 26 major pro teams. 
And fans are eating it up -- generating revenues of $200 million for 
the company in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into this because I love baseball,'' Levy said while  
overseeing his enterprise at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago 
Cubs. ``But I'm so busy at the ballpark that I have no time to 
watch the game and have to wait until I get home and find out the 
score on ESPN.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wrigley skyboxes, Levy provides ballpark staples such as  
wieners, but also such culinary treats as smokehouse barbecue pork. 
The Stadium Club provides more gourmet cuisine, like salmon 
souffle. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy also plays on regional favorites, offering sushi in  
California stadiums and Southern cooking at Nashville Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Even restaurant critics are starting to take notice of Levy's  
company, which got its start 20 years ago with a deli. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very good for what it is -- ballpark food. People don't  
expect gourmet food there,'' says Don Rose, a Chicago restaurant 
critic who has tasted Levy's skybox cuisine. ``The Levys have been 
able to take their know-how in the restaurant business and applied 
that at the ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brothers Larry and Mark Levy -- who now own 21 restaurants  
nationwide -- started out with a delicatessen in 1978. They didn't 
do well at first and their mother, Eadie, had to rescue them with 
recipes from her kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Her reward? Her own place. She still greets customers at Mrs.  
Levy's Delicatessen in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Levys got into the stadium food business when Chicago White  
Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf needed someone to cater his new skyboxes 
at Comiskey Park in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	``He promised us some playoff tickets if we did him the favor,''  
Larry Levy remembers. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy expanded to crosstown Wrigley Field, then to Cleveland's  
Jacobs Field. Now, Levy-fed stadiums are spread from the MCI Center 
outside Washington and Pro Player Stadium in Miami to Portland's 
Rose Garden and the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Levy has about one-fourth of the major pro sports market.  
He also caters rock concerts and even provided food for Pope John 
Paul II's visit to St. Louis in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned from our experience in the restaurant business,  
you never say 'no' to a customer,'' Levy says. ``We try to fill all 
kinds of special diet requests -- vegetarian, skinless chicken -- you 
name it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Guidici, a 36-year-old trader at the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, says the clients he brings to his skybox at Wrigley are 
thrilled with the food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food always gets compliments; there's never any  
complaints,'' Guidici says. ``They go out of their way to make sure 
everything is perfect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even after a Cubs game was called off one recent rainy  
afternoon, some skybox fans stayed to party for about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a complete wipeout for us. We made some money on  
early food sales,'' said Brett Bils, Levy's manager at Wrigley. 
``The leftover food goes to a shelter for battered women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just then, the dessert cart rolls by.  
</P>
<P>
	``Snickers pie, cheesecakes, giant taffy apples, gourmet ice  
cream bars, white chocolate pecan turtles, All-American apple pie. 
I promise, everything is fat-free,'' says Toni Parker, operator of 
the Levy dessert wagon, aptly decorated with replicas of Wrigley's 
signature ivy and brick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the desserts are what they remember when they leave  
the ballpark,'' Bils says. ``We hope they remember the good food 
and good time they had here and want to come back for more someday 
soon.''

<HEADLINE>  Ethiopian Wins Closest Bolder Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Berhanu Adanne of Ethiopia outmaneuvered  
Armando Quintanilla and Hezron Otwori in the final quarter-mile 
Monday to win the closest race in Bolder Boulder history. 
</P>
<P>
	Lidia Simon, a marathon runner from Romania, captured the  
women's individual title, but Ethiopia won the $12,000 team 
championship, edging second-place Kenya by four points. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Quintanilla, the 1994 champion, Mexico won the men's team  
title -- finishing second, fourth and sixth. Adanne's Ethiopian team 
was eight points behind, and Columbia came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the best races in the event's 21-year history,  
Quintanilla, Adanne and Otwori each led in the final half-mile 
before Adanne started to pull away with 400 meters remaining. He 
made his move on a hill leading into Folsom Field and finished in 
29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintanilla, who dictated the pace for much of the 10-kilometer  
race, tried to catch Adanne in the final 200 meters, but he 
finished two seconds behind. Otwori, second last year, was three 
seconds back of Adanne, and seven seconds separated the top five 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, an Olympian in 1996, trailed only briefly in the women's  
race and opened a four-second lead over Ethiopia's Asha Gigi just 
after the five-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was never challenged down the stretch and blew kisses to  
the stadium crowd as she crossed the finish line in 32:30. Gigi was 
17 seconds back and Jane Ngotho of Kenya was third in 32:52. 
</P>
<P>
	Gigi led the Ethiopians with her second-place finish, while  
teammates Werknesh Kidane and Eyerusalem Kuma finished fifth and 
11th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending women's champion Jane Omoro of Kenya, whose winning  
time was 33:26 last year, was sixth in 33:06. Deena Drossin was the 
top U.S. woman, finishing fourth in 32:56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese women won the team title last year, but did not  
compete because of NATO's accidental bombing of their embassy in 
Yugoslavia. The bombing prompted the closure of the American 
consulate in China, and the Chinese racers were unable to obtain 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing was defending men's champion Simon Rono of Kenya,  
who skipped the race because of the death of his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Albina Gallyamova, 35, of St. Petersburg, Russia, won the  
women's citizen's race in 34:56. It was her first time competing in 
the Bolder Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Wilson, 30, of Bruce, Australia, was the top finisher in  
the men's citizen field, finishing in 30:42. Wilson was one of four 
Australian professional runners to travel to Boulder, but each 
country can have only three racers in the elite race.

</P>
<P>
	Led by Quintanilla, the 1994 champion, Mexico won the men's team  
title -- finishing second, fourth and sixth. Adanne's Ethiopian team 
was eight points behind, and Columbia came in third. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the best races in the event's 21-year history,  
Quintanilla, Adanne and Otwori each led in the final half-mile 
before Adanne started to pull away with 400 meters remaining. He 
made his move on a hill leading into Folsom Field and finished in 
29 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintanilla, who dictated the pace for much of the 10-kilometer  
race, tried to catch Adanne in the final 200 meters, but he 
finished two seconds behind. Otwori, second last year, was three 
seconds back of Adanne, and seven seconds separated the top five 
men. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon, an Olympian in 1996, trailed only briefly in the women's  
race and opened a four-second lead over Ethiopia's Asha Gigi just 
after the five-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon was never challenged down the stretch and blew kisses to  
the stadium crowd as she crossed the finish line in 32:30. Gigi was 
17 seconds back and Jane Ngotho of Kenya was third in 32:52. 
</P>
<P>
	Gigi led the Ethiopians with her second-place finish, while  
teammates Werknesh Kidane and Eyerusalem Kuma finished fifth and 
11th, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending women's champion Jane Omoro of Kenya, whose winning  
time was 33:26 last year, was sixth in 33:06. Deena Drossin was the 
top U.S. woman, finishing fourth in 32:56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese women won the team title last year, but did not  
compete because of NATO's accidental bombing of their embassy in 
Yugoslavia. The bombing prompted the closure of the American 
consulate in China, and the Chinese racers were unable to obtain 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
	Also missing was defending men's champion Simon Rono of Kenya,  
who skipped the race because of the death of his sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Albina Gallyamova, 35, of St. Petersburg, Russia, won the  
women's citizen's race in 34:56. It was her first time competing in 
the Bolder Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Wilson, 30, of Bruce, Australia, was the top finisher in  
the men's citizen field, finishing in 30:42. Wilson was one of four 
Australian professional runners to travel to Boulder, but each 
country can have only three racers in the elite race.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Completes Indy, Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- As Tony Stewart flew over the speedway, one  
race down, the second just about to start, he looked down at the 
crowd that was cheering and waving at him, and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is awesome,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Yes, his double-duty day was quite a trip.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart became the first driver to complete both the  
Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in the same day Sunday, 
racing 1,090 miles in about 10 hours. He went from last to fourth 
with a hard-charging drive in the Coca-Cola after finishing ninth 
at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	And when the day was finally done, he collapsed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eventful. Definitely eventful,'' a weary-looking Stewart said  
after the race. ``I'm ready for a nap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or hibernation, perhaps. Stewart, who ate barely anything all  
day Sunday, was sick for the last hour of the Coca-Cola. When he 
climbed out of his car, his legs gave out and he sank to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He sat next to his car for several minutes with a wet towel  
wrapped around his head, occasionally drinking fluids. He got 
oxygen, and then was put on a stretcher and taken to the track 
hospital where he was given fluids and released. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never use the head rest in cars and I used the head rest the  
last 60-70 laps,'' he said. ``I felt like I was about 90 percent 
and leaving 10 percent on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not good enough for NASCAR's hottest rookie, who said he  
doubts he'll try the double again next year. Stewart, who switched 
to NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit after three years in the Indy 
Racing League, had said all along the Coca-Cola was his priority. 
But Indy is still special to Stewart, who grew up 45 miles away in 
Columbus, Ind., and he wanted a chance to win it. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it meant running his body into the ground for a day.  
</P>
<P>
	John Andretti is the only other driver to race in Indy and the  
Coca-Cola on the same day, but he crashed in 1994 and didn't finish 
the 600. Robby Gordon's bid to do the double in 1997 was rained out 
in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been experience I'll never forget. ... I wouldn't  
trade it for anything,'' Stewart said. ``As much fun as I had 
today, it wasn't fair to these guys to give them 90 percent for the 
last few laps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was fun while it lasted, though. When he got out of his car  
at Indy, four laps behind winner Kenny Brack, raising his index 
finger to tell fans, ``One more.'' He hurried to his trailer, 
changed into jeans and a red T-shirt and made a brief stop at his 
garage to thank his crew and say goodbye. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was running strong early, but his car developed handling  
problems and a mistake in the pits didn't help. While working on 
the Dallara Oldsmobile Aurora, the crew released the jack too soon 
and slightly damaged the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was off to a helicopter waiting in the infield near the  
third turn. He flew to the Indianapolis airport, where The Home 
Depot, his sponsor, had its private jet waiting for the 65-minute 
flight to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all honesty, I'm not as disappointed as I thought I'd be,''  
Stewart said on the flight to North Carolina. ``Obviously, I wanted 
to win the race and anything short is a disappointment. But we did 
everything we could. We fought hard all day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he was on the plane, Stewart changed into his NASCAR racing  
suit, ate a Power Bar and guzzled some Powerade and water. Though 
he'd only had a couple of mini-bagels before Indy, he wasn't hungry 
and didn't eat anything else -- a move that might have cost him 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have planned that better,'' he said at the end of the  
night. ``We were so concerned about keeping fluids in me we didn't 
think about getting food in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did get in a nap, though, stretching out on the couch in the  
back of the plane for most of the flight. By the time the jet 
landed, Stewart was awake and ready to go again. After another 
helicopter ride -- this time on fellow NASCAR driver Rusty Wallace's 
helicopter -- he arrived at Lowe's Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd let out a huge roar when the helicopter landed about a  
half-hour before the race began, and he got into a white Camaro and 
was driven around the track for driver introductions. 
</P>
<P>
	He was supposed to start 27th, but he was banished to the last  
and 43rd spot because he missed the drivers' meeting. He worked his 
way up quickly, weaving through the field until he took the lead on 
lap 268. For the rest of the race, he battled Jeff Burton and 
teammate Bobby Labonte for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's someone we're going to have to deal with next week and  
next year and well into the future,'' Burton said. ``It wouldn't 
surprise me if he won some races this year -- not just a race, but 
some races.''

<HEADLINE> Capel, Miller Developing Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Sprinters John Capel of Florida and Coby  
Miller of Auburn have stirred up a rivalry that will reach its peak 
in the NCAA Championships beginning Wednesday at Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel is fanning the flames of the confrontation, Miller is  
downplaying it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is who's going to win this time and who's going  
to lose?'' Capel said. ``And who's going to get raked over in the 
newspapers? 
</P>
<P>
	``Coby said he had no competition because he was dominating the  
sprints. I don't see that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, Miller was dominating the collegiate sprints until  
Capel beat him in the 200 meters at the Southeastern Conference 
Championships in 19.99 seconds. That was the first sub-20 second 
clocking by a collegian in 11 years, only the fourth ever, the 
first by a freshman, and made Capel the fastest American in the 200 
this year. Not even Michael Johnson, the world record-holder, nor 
Maurice Greene, ranked No. 3 in the world, ran faster in college. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only Frank Fredericks of Namibia, ranked No. 2 in the  
world, has run faster than Capel in 1999, with times of 19.87 and 
19.92. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Miller won't concede anything to Capel.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great competitor,'' the Tigers' junior said. ``I never  
underestimate anyone. He had a little more left at the end than I 
did. He beat me over the last 10 meters. He got me on form. I got 
out of my form. This time, I'm going to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're friends. We talk. We congratulate each other. There's no  
sense holding grudges against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see a rivalry. It depends on whose on top of his game  
that day. If you're on top of your game, you should be successful. 
Most look at me as the favorite. It's a great honor to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Capel ran his sizzling 19.99, Miller was runner-up at  
20.09, his career best. 
</P>
<P>
	While Capel got his victory over Miller in the 200, his first  
during the outdoor season, Miller beat Capel in the 100 -- 10.10 to 
10.12. 
</P>
<P>
	In that instance, Capel felt he should have won.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had the race won,'' he said, ``but I leaned at the wrong  
line. The lines were messed up, so I leaned too soon. Coby kept 
running. I was leading with about 5 to 8 meters left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the fierceness of their competition, the two have mutual  
respect. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I line up against him, I race my hardest because the  
first person that gets lazy is going to lose, or whoever makes the 
first mistake is going to lose,'' Capel said. ``I hate losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Losing makes me train harder. I'm training harder than ever.  
It's paying off, but coach (sprint coach Mike Holloway) says I can 
improve.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller also has trained hard this season, losing about 10 pounds  
to his present weight of 188. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a perfect weight,'' he said. ``I run with a lot of  
power. I carry weight well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weight loss, plus the tutoring and counseling of Auburn  
coach Ralph Spry, a former world-class long jumper, helped Miller 
win the NCAA indoor title at 200 meters and set school records 
outdoors in the 100 and 200. His best outdoor time is 10.03, 
third-fastest in the world, and better than 1976 Olympian Harvey 
Glance's 22-year-old Auburn record of 10.04, and he has twice 
broken Daron Council's 1985 school record 200-meter time of 20.29. 
</P>
<P>
	A change in attitude also has been beneficial to Miller, who is  
in his first season at Auburn after spending one year at East 
Central Community College in Decatur, Miss., and one year at 
Meridian (Miss.) Community College, where he won the National 
Junior College indoor 55-meter championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``This season I have changed from a negative attitude to a  
positive attitude,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has given up football in which he was a high school star  
in Louisville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel also was an outstanding scholastic football player in  
Brooksville, Fla., and still is playing. He was a return specialist 
for the Gators last season, averaging 30 yards per return. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NCAA championships, the two sprinters will meet in the  
100 and 200, while Capel will run on Florida's 400-meter relay 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Capel will have help from teammate Bobby Williams, who also is  
in the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll try to gang up on Coby,'' Capel said. ``We're all going  
after Coby.''

<HEADLINE> Man-Made Lakes Eyed for Recreation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's 1,782 man-made federal lakes,  
created to boost power, grow crops and control floods, have great 
untapped potential for fishing, boating and other recreation, a 
presidential commission has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress and federal agencies, however, pay little attention to  
recreation and provide insufficient funds to maintain facilities 
now deteriorating, the National Recreation Lakes Study Commission 
said in a study coming out Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake managers often make recreation their lowest priority  
because of laws, agency policies and a ``corporate culture'' that 
values traditional uses of reservoirs such as navigation and 
irrigation, commission members said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a lot of cases, it appears (recreation) is being ignored,''  
said Richard Davies, commission vice chairman and director of the 
Arkansas Department of Parks &AMP; Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the population rises and outdoor amusement becomes more  
popular, the lakes' potential for holiday recreational activities 
has become as important as the traditional uses, the commission 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're great national treasures,'' said Tom Strickland, U.S.  
attorney for Colorado and a commission member. ``They generate 
enormous social benefits in terms of recreation and just play 
opportunities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lakes, found in 47 states, resulted from massive public  
works projects primarily from the 1950s through the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Many were built with adjacent campgrounds and beaches, but the  
commission found that restrooms, boat docks and roads are falling 
apart, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many lakes are polluted, and sport fishing suffers because fish  
are dying. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal recreation funding for lakes has been shrinking, from  
$889 million in 1994 to $839 million in 1998 for the seven largest 
agencies that manage them. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, dwindling funds have contributed to a maintenance  
backlog of more than $800 million at the lakes, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	Even where lakes have active tourism, managers face difficult  
tasks in balancing recreation and other lake uses. 
</P>
<P>
	At Lake Mead near Las Vegas, the largest reservoir in North  
America at 180,000 acres, water levels can fluctuate by as much as 
50 feet depending on water demand, snow levels and diversions for 
flood-control storage. 
</P>
<P>
	That means boat docks have to be moved in and out and rest rooms  
can wind up under water. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a balancing act,'' said Kent Turner, chief of resources  
for the National Park Service there. ``There's a lot of planning 
that has to revolve around the water level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are so few boat launches at Lake Mead and other lakes that  
many visitors must show up early and wait in long lines if they 
hope to get their boats in the water, said Ryck Lydecker of the 
Boat Owners Association of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not the way to run a lake,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission, authorized by Congress in 1996 to assess lake  
recreation and look for ways to improve it, made 16 recommendations 
to address the problems, including: 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal agencies should make recreation a higher priority, with  
appropriate funding and attention. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress should authorize a permanent fee structure at the  
lakes and allow more agencies to collect fees. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federal agencies get more flexibility to address recreational  
needs. For instance, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps 
of Engineers should be able to build recreational facilities 
without finding a state or local partner, as current law requires.

<HEADLINE> Samaranch Intends To Complete Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch on Monday dismissed the notion of early retirement and 
insisted he will complete the remaining two years of his term. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch played down any rift with IOC vice president Dick  
Pound, who last month suggested Samaranch might leave after 
ushering in reforms at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 78-year-old Spaniard cited the overwhelming vote of  
confidence -- 86-2 -- he won in a secret ballot in March during a 
special session dealing with the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position depends on the IOC members,'' Samaranch said in an  
interview Monday with The Associated Press. ``The secret ballot we 
had in Lausanne was very clear. The IOC members think I am the 
right man at this moment to lead the changes we need in the IOC. 
With the confidence of the IOC members, I am ready to finish my 
mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been in office since 1980, was re-elected to  
his latest four-year term in 1997. His successor is to be chosen at 
the IOC session in Moscow in September 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch plans to call a special general assembly in December  
to approve changes in the structure and operations of the IOC. An 
IOC commission is holding its first meeting in Lausanne this week 
to study the reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound, the IOC's chief negotiator of television and sponsorship  
deals, is a possible successor as IOC president. He said Samaranch 
might set an example by stepping down if the retirement age is 
lowered from 80 to 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch wrote to Pound expressing disappointment at his  
remarks, which were quoted in an Australian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't judge what he said or did not say,'' Samaranch said.  
``What I am judging with Dick Pound is our relations of 18-19 
years. He is always working very close to me. I am giving him the 
most important responsibilities. Dick Pound was one who always 
defended me. I consider Dick Pound one of the most important 
members of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, in an unusual public rebuke by a fellow executive board  
member, Kevan Gosper of Australia criticized Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public comments by Dick Pound were rather unfortunate to  
say the least,'' said Gosper, another presidential hopeful. ``His 
postulation that Samaranch might go early was unwelcome. 
Samaranch's intentions are quite clear: He intends to see out his 
mandate. He has repeated that to me and I fully support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound is not attending the IOC meetings in Lausanne this week  
because of commencement exercises at Montreal's McGill University, 
where he holds a senior position. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a telephone interview with the AP, Pound reiterated that  
Samaranch could decide to leave early -- no matter his public 
pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every term has its limits,'' Pound said. ``But it's a term,  
not a sentence. If (Samaranch) were to decide sometime before the 
end of the term that he has done what he wants to do, he is free to 
make any decision he wants.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Mathison Happy on Daytime TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERMUDA RUN, N.C. (AP) -- Cameron Mathison has some reassuring  
words for fans of his character Ryan Lavery on ``All My Children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to move into prime time and films,'' he said.  
``That's a long-term goal for me. However, I consider myself very 
lucky to be working as an actor and on `All My Children.' If I had 
a long career in daytime, I would consider myself very lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mathison was in town to play in a golf tournament that also  
attracted actor M. Emmett Walsh, figure skater Scott Hamilton and 
``Entertainment Tonight'' co-host Bob Goen. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathison said he hadn't expected to fulfill his dream of  
becoming an actor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I come from a professional family,'' he said. ``Being an actor  
wasn't in the cards. But I would go to the movies and think, 'I 
could do that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight months after his first audition, he landed the role on  
``All My Children.''

<HEADLINE>  Prep Star Could Be Top Baseball Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton may have an easier time  
playing professional baseball than finding cleats to fit his 
18 1/2-inch feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's huge feet haven't slowed his progress toward the top  
of the major league baseball draft list. The Raleigh Athens Drive 
prep star may be the No. 1 overall pick by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem. I guess I've grown up with them,''  
Hamilton said of his rather large feet. ``My shoe size stayed the 
same as my age up until I was 14, and then it took off. When I as 
14 I was wearing a size 16.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 200-pound outfielder-pitcher has a good chance to  
be the first high school player chosen No. 1 in the draft since 
Seattle selected a prep shortstop by the name of Alex Rodriguez in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Jennings, director of scouting for Tampa Bay, spent hours in  
meetings over the weekend with scouts who have watched Hamilton's 
every move for the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him pitch up to 96 mph, I've seen him hit homers and  
I've seen him hit an inside-the-park homer,'' Jennings said. ``He 
shows you what you want to see in a major league prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old left-hander hit .514 with 13 home runs in high  
school this past season, when teams chose to pitch to him instead 
of around him. Last week in an American Legion game, Hamilton was 
intentionally walked three times. When he finally got a chance to 
hit, be hit a homer. Then, after the game, he signed balls for 
players on the other team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton shrugs off all the attention he has received, calling  
it fun but hectic. 
</P>
<P>
	During one high school game for Athens, 55 scouts attended to  
watch him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Josh has been under such a microscope,'' said his father, Tony  
Hamilton. ``Tampa had people at 20 of the 25 games he played. And 
not just one, but two, three and four people. Everything he does, 
how he walks, talks, acts, they are taking notes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's how teams act when they're preparing to make a $3 million  
or $4 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's life has been consumed by baseball since he was 7,  
when he moved up to Little League two years ahead of his schedule 
and was coached by his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw the ball and hit the ball too hard for the kids his  
age,'' Tony Hamilton said. ``He played center field in Little 
League and he always stayed mad because he batted ninth. He said, 
`Why am I batting ninth? I can hit.' I told him he was the youngest 
and the smallest so he was going to hit ninth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is no longer the smallest, but some say simply the best  
prep prospect to come along in quite awhile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never put a `can't miss' label on any player, there  
are risk factors,'' Jennings said. ``It is unfair to the player, 
but he has tremendous God-given ability. The thing I like most 
about him is Josh Hamilton likes to play the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is already preparing for his foray on pro ball by  
taking half his batting practice with a wooden bat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got pop. Wood or aluminum -- he could hit with a telephone  
pole,'' said Royals scout Paul Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's character also impresses scouts, who call him a  
`throw-back' type of athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was going to be something special because of the way  
he goes about his game. He's serious business,'' Faulk said. ``He 
goes about the game the way you should -- 100 percent. If you talk 
to the kid for five minutes, you know he's a good kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How good? Hamilton had several invites to attend his recent high  
school prom, but turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided it was best I didn't go,'' he said. ``I am trying to  
stay away from crowds and different groups. If something bad 
happened at the wrong time, I didn't want to be in that 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is quite aware of his future, and where he would like  
to end up -- in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really nervous about the draft, but (I'm) anxious to  
see what is going to happen, who I am going to go with,'' he said. 
``I guess I am ready to get started. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was in first grade, we had to write a story about what  
you wanted to be when you grew up and I wrote that I want to be a 
professional baseball player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton begins living his dream Wednesday.

<HEADLINE>  Prep Star Could Be Top Baseball Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton may have an easier time  
playing professional baseball than finding cleats to fit his 
18 1/2-inch feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's huge feet haven't slowed his progress toward the top  
of the major league baseball draft list. The Raleigh Athens Drive 
prep star may be the No. 1 overall pick by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 
on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a problem. I guess I've grown up with them,''  
Hamilton said of his rather large feet. ``My shoe size stayed the 
same as my age up until I was 14, and then it took off. When I as 
14 I was wearing a size 16.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4, 200-pound outfielder-pitcher has a good chance to  
be the first high school player chosen No. 1 in the draft since 
Seattle selected a prep shortstop by the name of Alex Rodriguez in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Jennings, director of scouting for Tampa Bay, spent hours in  
meetings over the weekend with scouts who have watched Hamilton's 
every move for the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him pitch up to 96 mph, I've seen him hit homers and  
I've seen him hit an inside-the-park homer,'' Jennings said. ``He 
shows you what you want to see in a major league prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old left-hander hit .514 with 13 home runs in high  
school this past season, when teams chose to pitch to him instead 
of around him. Last week in an American Legion game, Hamilton was 
intentionally walked three times. When he finally got a chance to 
hit, be hit a homer. Then, after the game, he signed balls for 
players on the other team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton shrugs off all the attention he has received, calling  
it fun but hectic. 
</P>
<P>
	During one high school game for Athens, 55 scouts attended to  
watch him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Josh has been under such a microscope,'' said his father, Tony  
Hamilton. ``Tampa had people at 20 of the 25 games he played. And 
not just one, but two, three and four people. Everything he does, 
how he walks, talks, acts, they are taking notes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's how teams act when they're preparing to make a $3 million  
or $4 million investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's life has been consumed by baseball since he was 7,  
when he moved up to Little League two years ahead of his schedule 
and was coached by his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``He threw the ball and hit the ball too hard for the kids his  
age,'' Tony Hamilton said. ``He played center field in Little 
League and he always stayed mad because he batted ninth. He said, 
`Why am I batting ninth? I can hit.' I told him he was the youngest 
and the smallest so he was going to hit ninth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton is no longer the smallest, but some say simply the best  
prep prospect to come along in quite awhile.

<HEADLINE> Recession Widens Japan Social Gaps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese have long taken pride in their success at  
building a modern economy free of the gaps between rich and poor 
that plague other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	But while many here still see their country as one big, happy  
middle-class family, a few are raising cries of alarm that Japan's 
vaunted social equality may be disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence is in figures showing that a long recession and  
efforts to open the economy to competition are broadening the gap 
between haves and have-nots at an alarming pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few countries have seen inequality rise so sharply in  
such a short period,'' said Toshiaki Tachibanaki, an economist at 
Kyoto University, one of the most prestigious in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, Japan still receives praise for its ability  
to spread the fruits of affluence throughout its population. Social 
equality is widely seen behind Japan's enviably low rates of crime 
and school drop outs. 
</P>
<P>
	It has also played an important role in Japan's social contract.  
Consumers have put up with high prices and inefficiency in exchange 
for the peace of mind of knowing they would have no problem keeping 
up with the average income. 
</P>
<P>
	But economic statistics are starting to show a troubling trend.  
</P>
<P>
	The most common way to measure how evenly a country's incomes  
are distributed is a mathematical tool called the gini coefficient, 
which rates a country on a scale of 0 to 1. The closer to 1, the 
less equal. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Japan's gini coefficient had been stuck at a very low  
level: about 0.3 as measured by the Health and Welfare Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the 1980s, the figure has soared. In 1993, the most  
recent year for which figures are available, the coefficient stood 
at 0.44, almost exactly the same as the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers like Tachibanaki, who has waged a long, often lonely  
campaign to draw attention to the trend, say the number has 
probably risen even further in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, by most standards Japan remains more equitable by a  
long shot than the United States. Poverty levels in Japan are less 
than half the U.S. figure of 16 percent, and corporate executives 
make only a few times more than their average employee, compared 
with 10s or 100s more in American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recent gini coefficients do place Japan among the less  
equitable countries in Europe, like England, and far behind 
countries with strong welfare systems such as Sweden and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	``The myth that we were different has been shattered,'' lamented  
an article on the trend in the influential Asahi newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the factors contributing to the growing gap has been a  
government campaign to end Japan's nine-year economic slump by 
lifting restrictions on competition. 
</P>
<P>
	That has forced companies to scrap the old egalitarian lifetime  
employment system, with its age-based wage scales, in favor of 
rewarding productive workers with higher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranks of those earning little or no income have also swelled  
as the economy's slide into recession has increased bankruptcies 
and corporate job-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors are less obvious.  
</P>
<P>
	One is the growing number of women in the work force, as social  
mores relax and families seek second incomes. They show up in 
government statistics as a surge in low-income workers because they 
get paid so much less than Japanese men -- about half, according to 
recent studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there were the soaring land prices in the 1980s, which  
still help split the country into haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
	When prices took off, those lucky enough to own land, usually  
through inheritance, had the chance to become instant millionaires. 
The rest have seen the dream of home ownership slip beyond their 
reach -- and bigger chunks of their salary into their landlord's 
pocket. 
</P>
<P>
	A return to equality seems highly unlikely. Tokyo appears  
committed to free-market reforms. In fact, wage gaps could widen 
further as the government trims the top income tax rates in a 
Reaganomics-inspired effort to boost investment and consumption. 
</P>
<P>
	But then again, inequality may be Japan's normal state, said  
Tachibanaki. The country saw large gaps between rich and poor for 
most of its history. Equality of incomes was only achieved in the 
years after World War II, after Japan's defeat leveled social 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the last century, the relative equality of  
1950s and 1960s appears as an anomaly,'' Tachibanaki said.

<HEADLINE> French Open Treats Older Women Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- While a new generation of women dominate the  
headlines, look who's winning at the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, Steffi Graf, Conchita Martinez, Arantxa  
Sanchez-Vicario and Monica Seles all have made their way to the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, much of the heralded new generation -- the Williams  
sisters, Anna Kournikova and Amelie Mauresmo -- are out after a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, who made her Roland Garros debut in 1989, plays Spain's  
Martinez, making her 12th appearance in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, in the final eight for the 13th consecutive year, plays  
Davenport, in the French Open for the seventh time. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez-Vicario, the defending champion, is making her 13th  
appearance at Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, who'll be 30 in June, is the elder stateswoman of the  
women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	She's a fan of the younger generation but showed that she isn't  
ready to step aside on Sunday by beating 17-year-old Kournikova 
6-3, 7-6 (7-4) on center court. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's game, Graf says, can only benefit from the publicity  
attracted by the new generation of players. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sport is gaining public attention, and the way players  
present themselves is more outspoken with a lot more confidence,'' 
she says. ``That is very positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Graf doesn't believe experienced players are any worse off  
as a result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we have been written off,'' Graf said. ``We  
have been around so long that I guess the stories about us get a 
little boring at some point. It is more fun if you hear something 
about the younger players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And she said competing against younger players doesn't present  
any new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I need to prove anything to anybody. I go out to  
play tennis against somebody whether they are older or younger. It 
doesn't matter,'' Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf said the level of competition is much higher than when she  
ruled the women's game by winning 21 Grand Slam titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's much tougher on the tour earlier on in tournaments these  
days. The field has gotten much closer,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Graf worries there might be an overemphasis among younger  
players on powerful physiques. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is surprising to me is that girls of 12 or 14 years old  
already have bodies that don't look that age. They already have 
well-developed muscles,'' she said. ``They seem very strong, very 
early on. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players used to be a lot skinner, tinier,'' she added. ``If  
you see some of the juniors now, the way they are built, it is 
clear that they are playing hours and hours a day. Their bodies 
might not last as long as they used to.''
